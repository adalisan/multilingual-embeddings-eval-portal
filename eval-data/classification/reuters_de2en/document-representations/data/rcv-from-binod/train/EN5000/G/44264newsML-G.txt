Afghanistan &apos;s rebel Taleban militia advanced towards the main eastern town of Jalalabad on Tuesday as it captured two districts in Nangarhar province , Taleban and other Afghan sources in Pakistan said . 
Pakistani officials said Nangarhar governor Haji Qadeer crossed into Pakistan on Tuesday evening after the Islamic militia said it had captured Khogiani district . 
earlier , an Afghan news service said the militia had taken control of Hisarak district in the west of the province . 
Khogniani fell to Taleban after local forces of Qadeer-led shura , or council , surrendered with their weapons , Taleban spokesman Maulvi Ahmad Jan told reporters in Peshawar . 
the Afghan Islamic Press ( AIP ) said the Taleban forces were now heading towards Jalalabad . 
AIP said both sides suffered dozens of casualties in Hisarak in western Nangarhar before the district fell to the Islamic militia . 
on Monday , Taleban said it had captured Hisarak the previous night , in an apparent drive to control the strategic highway from Kabul to Jalalabad . 
but the shura , or council , which rules Nangarhar denied it had fallen . 
AIP quoted sources in the area as saying that Hisarak , about 70 km ( 44 miles ) southwest of the provincial capital Jalalabad , fell to Taleban on Tuesday . 
earlier on Tuesday , an Afghan government spokesman in Kabul said heavy fighting was raging in Hisarak and that President Burhanuddin Rabbani &apos;s administration had sent troops there from Sarobi to reinforce the defenders . 
government jets bombed Taleban positions in Azra district , in the adjoining Logar province , which Taleban captured from government forces on Friday , AIP said . 
the neutral factions have until this week stayed out of the conflict between the Taleban and the government , but the Taleban forced their hand by demanding military use of their territory . 
in the Afghan capital Kabul , Prime Minister Hekmatyar met the government &apos;s top military commander Ahmad Shah Masood , the official Kabul Radio said . 
the Taleban are believed to be eager to attack the town of Sarobi , which straddles the Kabul-Jalalabad highway and is a stronghold of Hekmatyar &apos;s Hezb-i-Islami faction . 
witnesses in Kabul said on Monday that dozens of tanks and troop carriers were on the move , apparently ready to be deployed in defence of Sarobi , about 60 km ( 40 miles ) east of Kabul . 
a Taleban spokesman , Maulvi Wakil Ahmad , said two Taleban jets had bombed government positions in Sarobi on Monday in retaliation for government air raids on Taleban posts . 
he said that if the Nangarhar shura sided with the government , the Taleban would not hesitate to fight it . 
he said the Taleban would not hold talks with the government until Rabbani resigned . 
the Taleban , besieging Kabul for the past year , have pledged to install a purist Islamic order throughout Afghanistan .
