Jordan &apos;s capital inflows hit a record $ 300 million in the first half this year , central bank governor Ziyad Fariz said . 
&quot; On the foreign investments level , the capital inflows are increasing and are estimated to have reached , since the start of the year until the first half , about $ 300 million , &quot; Fariz told businessmen at a private dinner on Tuesday . 
Fariz , in a speech obtained by Reuters on Wednesday , said that inflows should rise substantially by year-end as investors , heartened by groundbreaking economic decisions taken this year , were expected to embark on more joint ventures and step up purchases of Jordanian stock . 
the Central Bank &apos;s elimination of restrictions on foreign currency transfers earlier this month removed a major hurdle to foreign capital inflows by sending a strong signal of confidence , Fariz said . 
Jordan &apos;s stock market saw over $ 56 million of foreign purchases in the first half of 1997 , both from Arab investors and global foreign emerging funds . 
Ziyad said the trend was expected to grow as remaining foreign ownership restrictions are due to be finally eliminated soon . 
Prodded by global funds , the banking sector in Jordan is also witnessing an influx of Saudi and Kuwaiti funds unseen since the Gulf crisis to tap opportunities from Jordanian banks seeking to raise their capital base . 
Fariz said these substantial inflows have helped foreign currency cash reserves , which have already topped a 1997 target of $ 1.15 billion after ending 1996 at $ 697 million . 
Central Bank officials , who say reserves are now close to an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) three months import cover figure , say $ 1.5 billion by year-end was now in sight . 
Fariz told bankers the healthy reserve reflected progress in IMF directed economic reforms , helping Jordan to be on track to attain a 6.5 percent growth rate this year against a lower 5.2 percent rate the previous year . 
signs of stronger performance since the start of 1997 include a 19 percent rise in remittances by expatriates , a 10.5 percent rise in the value of earnings of the main export industries and a four percent rise in tourism receipts . 
comfortable reserves encouraged the Central Bank last month to ease the tight grip on monetary policy which since mid-1993 had drained excess liquidity and supported the currency , Fariz said . 
but Fariz said bankers should not to expect wide fluctuations in interest rates despite the introduction of a more market-sensitive interest rate mechanism in June , which pushed key benchmark rates down around one percentage point . 
&quot; Although we have left setting interest rates to market forces , the Central Bank is still capable of influencing interest rate levels through the CD ( certificates of deposit ) auctions and prevent undesired fluctuations , &quot; Fariz said . 
Fariz said that the Central Bank would continue to fine tune its monetary policy to ensure growth of healthy reserves on one side while ensuring sufficient liquidity to support an expansion in the economy . 
this would be attained by a substantially higher money supply growth target of around 8-9 percent by year-end , which effectively means that banks will be able to lend more . 
bankers expect this to activate some sluggish sectors hurt by a tight monetary policy which made borrowing costs prohibitively expensive for some industries and hampered growth .
