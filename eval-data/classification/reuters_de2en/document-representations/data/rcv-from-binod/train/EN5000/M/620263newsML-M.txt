through the evolution from a butter and cheese market to the world &apos;s largest energy futures market , one thing has remained constant at the New York Mercantile Exchange : shouting , wild gesticulating and the occasional fight . 
&quot; It &apos;s about as American as it gets . 
there has always been shouting and yelling at the exchange , &quot; said Gary Lapayover , NYMEX vice chairman and a trader there for 24 years . 
the exchange , which recently celebrated its 125th anniversary , is about to move to new high-tech premises . 
but the process of dealers shouting &apos; buy &apos; and &apos; sell &apos; orders in trading pits , termed &quot; open outcry , &quot; remains as rough and tumble today as it was in decades past . 
&quot; I have seen fights break out , which is inevitable because this place gets packed shoulder to shoulder . 
but there is nothing like it because each day there is a new opportunity and you have a new slate , &quot; said Pat Tassone , a crude oil dealer for Smith Barney . 
though electronic trading is accounting for an increasing amount of business , NYMEX officials expect the exchange traders to go shouting and yelling into the next millenium . 
&quot; It &apos;s actually very efficient and fairly honest . 
it provides opportunities no matter what background you have . 
I don &apos;t think it will be phased out in the next 30 years , &quot; said Lapayover . 
still , much of the exchange &apos;s history has been about the need to modernise and invent new markets , so the move toward electronic trading is an inevitable step . 
in early July , NYMEX is scheduled to move to a new building in downtown Manhattan that sports two 25,000 square foot trading floors , providing four times its current trading space . 
NYMEX first started in 1872 as a way for dairy merchants to obtain their products more effectively . 
new York City was becoming a port for a variety of products , from cocoa to tobacco , with no organised process of delivery . 
NYMEX &apos;s predecessor , the butter and cheese Exchange , started with only 62 merchants in downtown Manhattan . 
it was not until 1983 , with the advent of the crude oil futures contract , that NYMEX was able to bill itself as the largest energy futures market in the world . 
&quot; crude oil is what gave the exchange its global aura , &quot; said Daniel Rappaport , NYMEX &apos;s chairman . 
Rappaport also remains loyal to open outcry , having been an energy futures trader for 12 years before assuming the top post . 
when you stand in the ring you know you are alive , &quot; said Rappaport . 
&quot; I like to say &apos; it seems that every day you miss the opportunity of a lifetime , &apos; &quot; he said . 
through its history , NYMEX has become increasingly a home for the speculator who trades a futures contract purely for financial gain . 
but the exchange &apos;s primary early function was as a way for commercial suppliers to fix a future price for products to offset volatility in the physical market . 
much like today , the exchange was a forum for dealers to trade a contract that promised delivery at a fixed price . 
by the 1890s , eggs had become an increasingly important part of the exchange , and amid trading of the fragile commodity came the birth of open outcry . 
in a forthcoming book , &quot; Trading Through Time &quot; ( published by NYMEX ) , author Jane Kagan Vitiello quotes the New York Produce Review and American Creamery : &quot; On one occasion when the egg call ( trading session ) was discontinued , members gathered in groups and shouted out offerings something like they do on the Stock Exchange . 
afterwards , the authorities provided a big brass ring around which members took their places and a clerk at a desk in the middle recorded the transactions made . 
rationing during World War II and the development of aluminum rooftop coops during the war killed the egg trade . 
chickens could lay eggs all year round , taking the seasonality away from egg prices and the need to hedge . 
Serendipitously , Maine potato dealers were looking for an exchange after the war , so NYMEX sought salvation in spuds . 
the contract that delivered Maine potatoes was launched in 1950 and was to dominate the exchange &apos;s business until the late 1970s . 
but by 1976 , the potato market ran into crisis after a major player was unable to deliver on 3,000 contracts . 
in the 1970s those contracts , like gold , became increasingly an inflation hedge when the United States was suffering one of its worst inflationary periods . 
in 1978 , NYMEX launched the heating oil contract , which created a new avenue to get the product . 
it was the heating oil contract and the deregulation of the oil industry that paved the way for the 1983 launch of the crude oil contract .
