the race to succeed former prime minister John Major as leader of Britain &apos;s main opposition Conservative party heated up on Tuesday as two of the five candidates dropped out after the first-round ballot . 
former social security secretary Peter Lilley , who came fourth in the ballot , and former home secretary Michael Howard , who came last , said they were pulling out of the contest and backing former Welsh secretary William Hague . 
the news was a huge boost to Hague , at 36 the youngest in the field , who came second on Tuesday . 
one bookmaker immediately made him the favourite to win the contest . 
but it was bad news for former finance minister Kenneth Clarke , the winner of the first round , and it was a body blow for third-placed John Redwood . 
Redwood , who quit the cabinet in June 1995 to mount a challenge to Major &apos;s leadership that fell short , had called on Lilley and Howard to back him to unite the right-wing vote . 
but both Howard and Lilley clearly felt that Hague was the only chance of stopping Clarke , who is despised by the Conservative right for his centre-left and pro-European views . 
Lilley told reporters : &quot; I do not propose to stand in further rounds of the leadership election . 
my aim in standing was always to reunite , rebuild and renew the Conservative party . 
&quot; I believe that William Hague is now best placed to carry forward those objectives and to win the next general election . 
Howard echoed that message . 
I believe he is best placed to unite the party and lead us to victory at the next election , &quot; he said . 
aides to Redwood declined to comment on the news and there was no immediate reaction from the Clarke camp . 
but Hague said he was delighted . 
&quot; I now go into the second ballot with still greater confidence that I am the candidate who can unite the Conservative party , &quot; he said . 
a leading bookmaker immediately replaced Clarke with Hague as favourite to win the contest . 
bookmakers William Hill quoted Hague at 4-5 . 
Clarke was given odds of 11-10 and John Redwood 7-1 . 
to win next Tuesday , the leading candidate needs the votes of more than half the 164 Conservative MPs who survived Labour &apos;s landslide May 1 election victory . 
if there is no winner , the two front-runners will slug it out in a third ballot two days later . 
aides were frantically calculating the possible outcome . 
on Tuesday Clarke won 49 votes , Hague 41 , Redwood 27 , Lilley 24 and Howard 23 . 
on paper , if all the supporters of Lilley and Howard back Hague , he will take over the Conservative leadership from Major and take on Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair . 
but commentators said neither Lilley nor Howard could guarantee that all their votes would go to another candidate . 
Clarke is the most experienced of the five candidates . 
although he topped a consultative poll of senior party activists on Tuesday which does not count in the ballot , his pro-European views mean he cannot be sure of gathering the support of right-wingers in the second round . 
to add spice , the race is now open to candidates who did not fight the first round , although none have come forward .
