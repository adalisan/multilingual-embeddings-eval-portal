Tunisia &apos;s crude oil sales tender for early September cargoes was awarded at the top end of traders &apos; price expectations , prompting some to speculate that sweet crude in the Mediterranean could be following the North Sea higher , traders said on Tuesday . 
a cargo of Zarzaitine loading on September 8-10 was won by Elf at dated Brent + 48.5 cents while Glencore was believed to have won a Rhemoura loading on September 1-5 at an undisclosed price . 
this supported Algeria &apos;s attempt to raise its September Saharan Blend contract prices from the current 56 cent premium to dated Brent , a trader said , although contract holders are lobbying to keep prices unchanged . 
&quot; Oseberg is strong , West African is stable . 
there is no reason why Mediterranean sweets should go down , &quot; he added .
