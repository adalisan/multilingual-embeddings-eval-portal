an international mission investigating Serbia &apos;s election fraud crisis wound up its work trailing hopes of a way out to satisfy President Slobodan Milosevic and his cheated opposition . 
Felipe Gonzalez , head of a mission from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) said after talks with both sides that he would make recommendations within a week . 
the Zajedno coalition of opposition parties claimed it proved to the OSCE that it was cheated of victory in Belgrade and 14 other towns in local elections , unleashing five weeks of street demonstrations against Milosevic . 
opposition sources said the OSCE persuaded Milosevic to surrender the towns , including Belgrade , but that he would exercise his right to call a fresh poll early in 1997 to try to recover them for his ruling socialists . 
Gonzalez , a former socialist prime minister of Spain who saw Milosevic on his own , was bland about the outcome of the mission sent to dig Serbia out of five weeks of street demonstrations that show no sign of diminishing . 
but an American member of the OSCE team , veteran diplomat Max Kampelman , said the evidence it found of election fraud &quot; seems to be impressive . 
more than 100,000 opposition supporters and students demonstrated in Belgrade on Saturday along with 40,000 in Kragujevac and 20,000 in Leskovac . 
police kept the Kraguvevac protest and a socialist counter demonstration apart as the two sides traded insults . 
Zajedno accused police of intimidating the population of smaller towns to stop them demonstrating after Vranje activist Goran Krstic was arrested and beaten on Thursday . 
other arrests were reported in Zajecar and Kraljevo . 
the socialists &apos; use of courts to overturn Zajedno results for secret &quot; irregularities &quot; has inspired a U.S.-led push for democratic reforms in Serbia after half a century of communist and socialist rule . 
Zoran Djindjic , the main Zajedno leader and its mayoral candidate in Belgrade , said : 
&quot; The differences between the original results and the unprecedented court interventions are clear to all OSCE commission members . 
the only question is how to reinstate the original election results and resolve the crisis . 
opposition sources said Milosevic could order fresh local elections within a month in an attempt to regain control of the lost towns , many of them industrial centres where repudiation by the working class majority was a socialist humiliation . 
he is expected to come under heavy pressure to allow international monitoring of new elections and to give access to the state-controlled media by the opposition . 
winning fairly would be a tough challenge for the socialists , reportedly accused by Milosevic of allowing their local organisation to run down and rely on the power of state television to deliver election majorities . 
but there are signs that he has already started to sweeten voters by paying out frozen pensions and benefit to workers in state industry .
