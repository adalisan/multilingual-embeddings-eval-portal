Brazilian striker Ronaldo could yet be playing in Italy next season while Italy &apos;s World Cup star Roberto Baggio may be heading for France or England . 
fiorentina &apos;s Argentine captain Gabriel Batistuta could meanwhile find himself at an English club . 
with Juventus needing just one point , and maybe not even that , to clinch the Italian league soccer title , attention has turned inevitably towards next season . 
the well-worn transfer rumour-mill , always rumbling around , has started to grind out faster than ever . 
the big recent signing has been German captain Juergen Klinsmann to Sampdoria . 
but that is fact not fantasy and the Bayern Munich player has now left the headlines . 
others cannot be pushed out so easily . 
&quot; Ronaldo has chosen Inter , &quot; declared the front page of the Rome daily Corriere dello Sport on Tuesday with a photo-montage of the shaven-headed Barcelona striker in a black and blue shirt with a broad grin and his arms outstretched . 
&quot; The Brazilian ace becomes a star in our championship &quot; 
it quoted Reynalda Pitta , one of Ronaldo &apos;s agents , as telling Lazio boss Sergio Cragnotti that Ronaldo had chosen Inter instead of the Rome club &apos;s offer . 
inter president Massimo Moratti said that the club was interested but nothing had been agreed . 
&quot; I read the other day about Batistuta and now I read about Ronaldo ... There is interest and that has been known for a while . 
as is that of other clubs . 
but we are certainly not at the point that some papers say we are today , &quot; he said . 
the future of Ronaldo has become an obsession in Italy since the player hinted he might leave Barcelona if the Spanish club did not agree a new and more lucrative contract . 
the local media in Italy has chronicled the movements of Ronaldo for months , as hopes grew of a deal with Rome club Lazio and then appeared to evaporate away again . 
the Brazilian &apos;s transfer has been announced in both newspapers and television only to come to nothing . 
the player has indicated that he wants to stay at Barcelona , second in the league and winners of the European Cup Winners &apos; Cup , who also appear to want to keep him . 
the Gazzetta dello Sport said Inter were waiting to see whether Barcelona kept Ronaldo . 
at the same they were after Batistuta , who has become increasingly unsettled in Florence and has reportedly sounded keen on a move to Inter . 
the Argentine goalscorer has also been a reported target for Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson . 
however fiorentina want to keep their star player and refuse to countenance him joining another Italian club . 
Manchester has become another transfer talking point after Frenchman Eric Cantona announced his retirement . 
Italian newsapers said that Manchester United were after Baggio , also unsettled for most of the season at Milan , as a Cantona replacement although Marseille were also chasing . 
the English champions are also reportedly interested in signing Italy &apos;s Fabrizio Ravanelli from Middlesbrough as well as Middlesbrough &apos;s Brazilian midfielder Juninho . 
both played in the Middlesbrough team beaten by Chelsea in the F.A. 
Cup Final on Saturday . 
but according to various reports Juninho is also on his way to Atletico Madrid , possibly for a world record fee of 16.0 million pounds ( $ 26.3 million ) . 
Chelsea , the English F.A Cup winners , with three Italians on their books already , were meanwhile reported to have made a fresh 21 billion lire ( $ 13 million ) offer for Milan captain and international defender Paolo Maldini . 
Juventus , who sold Ravanelli and Gianluca Vialli last season after winning the European Cup , are also said to be close to sealing a deal taking Christian Vieri to Atletico Madrid . 
Alessandro Del Piero has also been mentioned as a possible departure , with excited reports this year of the Italian international being sighted in a London restaurant . 
officials at the Turin club have said that all players have their price and all offers will be evaluated . 
that is fact , proven by Ravanelli &apos;s sale . 
Ronaldo &apos;s arrival in Italy remains speculation -- for the moment .
