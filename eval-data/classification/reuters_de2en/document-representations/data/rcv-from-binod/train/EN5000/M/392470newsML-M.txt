the overnight death of China &apos;s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping left foreign exchange dealers in Asia unmoved on Thursday and the markets showed hardly any reaction . 
&quot; As far as the foreign exchange market is concerned Deng &apos;s been dead for two or three years anyway , &quot; commented the head of Treasury at a European bank in Singapore . 
at 0215 GMT the U.S. dollar was quoted at 1.6900 / 10 marks , virtually at the low of the day . 
it ended in New York on Wednesday at 1.6975 / 85 . 
investors usually flock to buy &apos; safe haven &apos; U.S. dollars at times of political turmoil and instability but dealers said there was no sign of any panic buying . 
&quot; On a boredom scale of one to ten , today ranks as a 12 . 
there &apos;s nothing happening , &quot; the chief foreign exchange trader at another European bank said . 
&quot; Deng was 92 and this was always going to happen . 
if you look at the Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese yuan , you &apos;ll see that they &apos;ve actually gone up against the U.S. dollar today , &quot; he added . 
the yuan opened at 8.2940 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai compared with a close on Wednesday of 8.2945 and dealers there said investors had been psychologically prepared for Deng &apos;s death . 
at 0230 GMT , the Hong Kong dollar was trading at 7.7430 / 40 to the U.S. unit , around 50 basis points firmer on the day . 
the head of Treasury at the European bank said the U.S. dollar had spiked up to hit a traded high of 1.7005 against the mark in New York shortly after confirmation that Deng had died was received by the market . 
&quot; That was just a classic knee-jerk reaction by New York . 
but here in Asia it &apos;s a case of &apos; buy the rumour , sell the fact &apos; , &quot; he said . 
it was unlikely the dollar would be affected much in the future since the market was assuming China &apos;s leadership was well-prepared for Deng &apos;s death , he added . 
&quot; I &apos;m no expert on Chinese politics but unless things get really nasty -- in-fighting between opposing factions , troops on the streets , that sort of thing -- then you &apos;re not going to see much on the foreign exchange front , &quot; he said . 
the chief foreign exchange trader agreed . 
Chinese President &quot; Jiang Zemin seems to have his feet tucked securely under the desk and as long as this is the case , you won &apos;t see much in the way of reaction from us , &quot; he said . 
( U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan ) Greenspan can move markets , but Deng can &apos;t .
