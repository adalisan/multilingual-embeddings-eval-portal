an agricultural attache posted at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi said India appears to have taken a &quot; breather &quot; after recent wheat purchases as the government assesses the impact on local and domestic prices . 
&quot; Some official sources have remarked that tendering may be complete until at least after harvest given potential logistical constraints , while rumors of a tender before Christmas are also making the rounds , &quot; the attache wrote in a report dated December 19 . 
the report was released by the U.S. Agriculture Department this week . 
&quot; The most likely scenario seems to be that STC ( the government-run State Trading Corporation ) will wait until after the new year to review what impact news of the imports has had on domestic and international prices , &quot; the attache said . 
the attache said Argentina is frequently mentioned as a possible origin for additional purchases , but said officials are unfamiliar with Argentine wheat and the STC may be reluctant to buy large volumes . 
on December 12 , India said it would import two million tonnes of wheat in fiscal 1996 / 97 to increase domestic supplies and check rising prices . 
India last imported wheat four years ago . 
Australia has sold 1.0 million tonnes of wheat to India . 
the attache said trade sources indicate India also bought 250,000 tonnes from Canada at $ 152.50 fob with an option for an additional 200,000 tonnes . 
the attache also said flour millers are exploring import options . 
&quot; However , it seems increasingly unlikely that large volumes of wheat will be purchased by the private sector and 100,000 ( tonnes ) may be the upper limit for private sector purchases , &quot; the attache wrote .
