Australian retail trade will contribute 0.5 percentage points to March quarter growth in GDP , data issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Friday shows . 
the constant-price result was in line with economists &apos; expectations and has therefore made little difference to GDP forecasts . 
retail is about 40 percent of all private consumption . 
if the retail number could be extrapolated -- that is , if the remainder of private consumption grew at the same rate -- then private consumption would contribute 1.4 or 1.5 percent to GDP growth . 
economists typically expect a smaller private consumption contribution . 
economists contacted by Reuters expect private consumption to contribute something like 1.0 percentage points to growth . 
private consumption is a component of the expenditure-based estimate of GDP ( GDP-E ) , which is averaged with income-based ( GDP-I ) and production-based ( GDP-P ) estimates to produce GDP-A , the focus of economic policy .
