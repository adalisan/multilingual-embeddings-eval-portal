any team drawn to face Club Esportiu Principat in next season &apos;s UEFA Cup will not be blamed for wondering where their opponents come from . 
but they might have been puzzled even before UEFA officials ruled they could not possibly allow a club into one of their showcase competitions that gloried in the name of The Real Madrid Supporters from Charlie &apos;s Restaurant . 
that was the team that won the league title and qualified to be the first club side to enter a European competition from the tiny principality of Andorra . 
when their name was rejected , the team tried first to call themselves Real Madrid , in honour of the Spanish giants they adore . 
unsurprisingly , this was also ruled out as being somewhat confusing . 
the club &apos;s hopes of going into Europe were raised on May 16 when UEFA announced that the Andorra League champions would enter the UEFA Cup . 
it only became reality two weeks later when Charlie &apos;s restaurant clinched the title with a formidable record of 20 wins and a draw in their 22-match league season . 
they scored 114 goals and only let in 12 . 
yet despite their impressive strike rate the title was still in doubt until the last game of the season . 
the champions exist on a shoestring budget of 500,000 pesetas ( $ 3,400 ) a year , half coming from player &apos;s subscriptions with the rest donated by the restaurant . 
all the players have full-time jobs and will have to take time off for the away leg . 
among the team are a driving school instructor , a travel agent and a stone mason . 
club president Tomas Gomez is a hairdresser and will have to close his shop to follow his team abroad . 
despite the odds being against them , Gomez believes his team can make an impact in Europe . 
he is keeping his fingers crossed that in the elimination round they face one of the weaker teams like CS Grevenmacher of Luxembourg or Inter Cable-tel Cardiff of Wales . 
if they can overcome their first opponents then CE Principat could even then find themselves up against former European champions Liverpool or Ajax . 
both will be in the UEFA Cup , entering the fray for the first round proper when it is drawn on August 9 . 
the new found success of CE Principat has left Gomez wondering how they can handle hordes of visiting fans . 
their average attendance is 350 and Gomez hopes it will grow to 800 for the home leg of the European adventure . 
he hardly dares think what might happen if Liverpool &apos;s Red Army were to descend on the country and its 64,000 inhabitants . 
as befits any team contemplating a European campaign , CE Principat have entered the transfer market . 
former Barcelona forward Julio Lucendo , who admits his best days are behind him , has joined the club and will lead the strike force . 
Lucendo was playing in a regional Catalan league but is waiting for an Andorran passport after marrying a local girl . 
the search is also on for another goalkeeper . 
&quot; We are looking for a goalkeeper who can help us . 
without belittling Castro , who did a good job for us last season , we need a minimum of two keepers if we are to play in Europe . 
on hearing of the success of the team from Charlie &apos;s Restaurant , Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz donated some equipment and money to the club . 
so far he has not offered Bodo Illgner or Jose Canizares on loan .
