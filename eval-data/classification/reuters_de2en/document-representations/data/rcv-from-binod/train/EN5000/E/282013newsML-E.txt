Vietnam enjoyed another year of rapid economic expansion in 1996 but problems could stymie growth in the future , the government said Tuesday . 
the government &apos;s General Statistics Office said that gross domestic product grew by 9.34 percent this year while industrial output increased 14.1 percent . 
this year &apos;s GDP growth rate was just below last year &apos;s rate of 9.5 percent and compared with average growth of 8.2 percent during 1991-95 , when market-style reforms began to take hold . 
however , the statistics office sounded a warning on the country &apos;s trade deficit , which this year widened to a record $ 4 billion from $ 2.2 billion because of a surge in imports . 
it said there had been mismanagement of imports , which had caused competition problems for local industry , and warned against moves to counter the trade imbalance by seeking to substitute imports rather than develop export-oriented industry . 
&quot; If these things are not overcome in time , that will counter the open-door policy , slow down economic growth and cause greater pressure on the balance of payments , &quot; it said . 
that was the view expressed in a United Nations report last month , which argued against restricting imports and in favour of more fundamental reform of the country &apos;s trade regime . 
the statistics office said the budget deficit was still at a serious level despite an increase in revenues and said disbursement of aid from foreign donors was still slow . 
it also gave a list of problems now plaguing the country &apos;s sprawling , often money-losing state sector , including competition from smuggled goods , imports paid for by letters of credit and foreign-invested companies . 
according to local media reports , more than half of 4,000 local-level state-owned enterprises are unprofitable and thousands are short of cash .
