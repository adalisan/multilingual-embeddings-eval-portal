White sugar futures perked up in Tuesday afternoon activity as trade houses took their cue from bullish sentiment in New York and pushed the spot May contract towards resistance , traders said . 
outright purchases from trade players triggered some May / August buying , although scale sellers were quick to move in as values climbed higher , they said . 
premium sellers were as usual waiting above the market to cap gains on the May / May arbitrage , which widened a touch as the strength of the London market slightly outpaced that of New York . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing too exciting -- we &apos;ve got ( premium ) selling above but New York has pushed up as well , &quot; said one trader . 
at 1745 GMT May was up $ 2.90 at $ 306.60 , 20 cents under its intraday high . 
August was up $ 2.30 at $ 306.20 and overall volume reached 1,018 lots . 
Paris positions followed a similar trading pattern to London in a turnover of 208 lots . 
may was up $ 3.00 at $ 306.00 and August up 50 cents at $ 304.00 .
