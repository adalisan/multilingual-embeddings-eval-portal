new Zealand Labour leader Helen Clark entered fresh coalition negotiations with the nationalist New Zealand First Party on Wednesday saying it was &quot; most certainly not &quot; the last meeting between the two parties . 
asked if Labour had given New Zealand First a final draft of a coalition proposal , Clark answered : &quot; We are exchanging documents all the time &quot; . 
Clark also said Labour was likely to meet again with the left-wing Alliance Party but nothing had been scheduled . 
earlier , a Labour spokesman said the party and New Zealand First had exchanged papers covering policy issues and allocation of ministerial portfolios . 
the caretaker National Party government and centre-left Labour have both been negotiating to form a government with NZ First since an inconclusive general election on October 12 . 
Parliament is due to convene for the first time by December 13 .
