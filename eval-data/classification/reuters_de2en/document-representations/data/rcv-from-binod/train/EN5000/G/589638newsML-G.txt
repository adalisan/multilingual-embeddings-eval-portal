President Mobutu Sese Seko , beset by illness and rebels at the gates of his capital , on Friday stepped aside after dominating Zaire for over three decades and amassing a fortune which reputedly once topped $ 4 billion . 
government spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba told a news conference after a cabinet meeting on the transition of power : &quot; The president ... has ceased all intervention in the affairs of the state . 
in a lengthy statement Kin-Kiey made clear that the government of Zaire was now in the hands of Prime Minister Likulia Bolongo . 
the Archbishop of Kisangani , Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo , chosen a week ago as mediator , would undertake negotiations with the rebel alliance of Laurent Kabila , leading to a new transitional government and later fresh elections , Kin-Kiey said . 
prostate cancer and a seven-month revolt broke Mobutu &apos;s grip on what is Africa &apos;s third largest , and potentially one of its richest countries . 
&quot; I have returned not to devote myself to Mobutu &apos;s interests or Mobutu &apos;s fortune as you write from time to time but to the higher interests of Zaire , &quot; he said on his return to Kinshasa after a fresh bout of cancer treatment in March . 
but with Kabila &apos;s rebels in control of much of the country , his room for manoeuvre appeared limited . 
ordinary Zaireans , weary of the ravages of the notoriously ill-disciplined army , poverty and widespread official corruption , have welcomed the rebels as liberators . 
adopting a leopard-skin cap and bird-handled ebony cane as his trademarks , Mobutu gave his sprawling and chaotic country at the heart of Africa a badly needed focus in the turbulent aftermath of independence from Belgium in 1960 . 
he won the support of the West by exploiting its strategic fears during the Cold War but as the years went by his popularity waned as he consolidated his hold over the country by keeping rivals in disarray and buying off enemies . 
a reluctant convert to democracy , he dragged his feet on elections until 1996 when he embraced the idea of presidential elections . 
the civil war knocked that idea off course . 
the son of a cook and a hotel maid , Mobutu , who stands six feet ( 1.8 metres ) tall , was born in Lisala in Equateur province on October 14 , 1930 . 
but the man who once appeared a giant to his people , his voice booming and deep , is a shadow of his former self . 
denounced as everything from a dictator to a thief , critics accuse him of ruining the nation , potentially rich from a wealth of minerals and farmland . 
a journalist turned soldier , he seized power in 1965 after the old Belgian Congo descended into chaos after independence . 
he amassed a personal fortune and solidified his grip on the country with a system of economic and political patronage that made millionaires of his close associates while most Zaireans remained mired in poverty . 
the word &quot; kleptocracy &quot; -- meaning government by thieves -- was coined with Mobutu &apos;s Zaire in mind . 
identifying the state with himself , Mobutu chose to change his country &apos;s name from Congo to Zaire and decreed what his people could wear or what they could name their children . 
despite human rights abuses and using his position to enrich himself , Mobutu became the darling of the United States and others in the West as a buffer against the communist bloc . 
Washington relied on Zaire as a supply route for the U.S.-backed rebels fighting an 18-year guerrilla war against the Marxist government of neighbouring Angola . 
Mobutu &apos;s usefulness to Washington faded as Soviet influence declined in Africa and Soviet communism finally collapsed . 
his erstwhile friends began to look more closely at his human rights record . 
under pressure to make reforms , the Zairean leader opened a Pandora &apos;s box when he permitted multi-party politics in April 1990 after more than two decades of single-party rule . 
at the same time , the mineral-based economy collapsed as production from vital copper mines in the south plummeted . 
Mobutu angered his Western backers , particularly Belgium , when soldiers attacked a student hostel in 1990 , killing dozens of students . 
Belgium cut aid in response . 
mass opposition to Mobutu grew through 1991 . 
surrounded by his Israeli-trained presidential guard , he retreated to his opulent northern palace in Gbadolite , dubbed &quot; Versailles in the Jungle &quot; , hurling defiance at his opponents . 
soldiers angry at not receiving a pay rise ran amok in Kinshasa in late 1991 . 
France and Belgium sent in troops to protect foreign nationals . 
looters killed at least 250 people . 
in August 1996 , Mobutu had prostate cancer surgery in Switzerland . 
while he convalesced in Europe , Tutsi rebels took up arms in the east to topple him and quickly routed an army left without training or equipment after years of neglect . 
his second wife , Bobi Ladawa , and Mobutu celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary on May 1 . 
she was Mobutu &apos;s mistress when his first wife Antoinette died in 1977 . 
often at her ailing husband &apos;s side , she is considered one of his closest advisers . 
it is unclear how many children he has . 
the most prominent are , Nzanga , his American-educated spokesman , and Kongolo , an officer in the elite presidential guard .
