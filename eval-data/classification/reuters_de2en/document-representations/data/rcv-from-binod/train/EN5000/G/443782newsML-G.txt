the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday it had urged Italy and Greece to allow Albanians fleeing violence and anarchy to enter and stay &quot; as long as necessary &quot; , because sending them back home could expose them to danger . 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) was helping the governments of both countries to prepare for a &quot; possible influx &quot; , although no mass movement has been detected , according to spokesman Kris Janowski . 
spokeswoman Maki Shinohara also told Reuters that UNHCR was was pressing Serbia and its ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo to be &quot; a little bit more generous &quot; . 
Albania &apos;s chaotic revolt , which began in the south where people have lost their savings in bogus investment schemes , has spread to the north in the past two days . 
law and order has broken down in Tirana after civilians looted arms depots and food warehouses , leading the U.N. Children &apos;s Fund ( UNICEF ) to sponsor hourly announcements on Albanian television urging youths to put down the dangerous and sophisticated weapons , according to a spokeswoman in Geneva . 
but the UNHCR said that only a &quot; limited number &quot; of Albanians , which he estimated to be in the hundreds , had fled over the border in their own vehicles or hired boats . 
&quot; At the moment only a limited number of individuals have left Albania . 
some fled targeted violence and apparently others fled the general conflict situation , &quot; Janowski told a briefing . 
&quot; Nevertheless , we are in close contact with the governments of Italy and Greece and are discussing arrangements for a possible influx of people . 
&quot; We are requesting neighbouring countries to allow those leaving Albania to enter their territory and to allow them to remain there as long as necessary under the current circumstances , &quot; he added . 
the temporary housing conditions should be in accordance with international human rights and humanitarian standards , according to the Geneva-based UNHCR . 
UNHCR envoys were helping the Italian and Greek governments to set up camps for Albanians , according to Shinohara . 
Italy has identified a shelter site near a former military airport at Bari-Palese , which can hold up to 1,000 , while Greece was planning facilities for 3,000 in the north , she added . 
&quot; We are asking these governments not to send Albanians back if they come in for the time being because it is a conflict situation . 
we are saying if they do flee , let them in and let them stay as long as necessary under acceptable conditions , &quot; Shinohara told Reuters . 
Janowski , asked whether UNHCR had been given assurances that Italy would not turn back Albanians fleeing violence , replied : 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we have any specific asssurances from the Italian government for the moment . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t take a lot of thinking to figure out that the situation in Albania is very , very confused and very volatile . 
&quot; It is , at least judging from reports from the ground and media , getting worse . 
under those circumstances , sending people back would be exposing them to possible dangers . 
UNICEF spokeswoman Marie Heuze said the agency was worried about the widespread distribution of arms : 
&quot; Given our mandate is protecting children , we are extremely preoccupied by the fact that the distribution of arms was so general that many children are walking around different zones of the country with extremely dangerous and sophisticated weapons &quot; . 
UNICEF had put advertisements on Albanian television &quot; asking children not to use arms , to be very careful and stop the violence &quot; . 
&quot; That is all we have been able to do at this stage , &quot; Heuze said . 
&quot; It is extremely serious . 
we are trying to reach children and parents to try to disarm groups of excited people .
