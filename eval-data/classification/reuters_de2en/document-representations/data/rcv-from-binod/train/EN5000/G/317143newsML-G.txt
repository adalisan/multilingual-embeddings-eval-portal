pasta replaced schnitzel as the food of choice on the alpine ski circuit at the weekend as Italians Deborah Compagnoni and Kristian Ghedina claimed a total of three wins . 
when the Austrians were dominating the downhill earlier in the season , Patrick Ortlieb claimed their success was fuelled by a diet of schnitzel . 
for the past three days it appears Italy have now found the recipe for success . 
Compagnoni , the world and Olympic champion , recorded back-to-back giant slalom victories in Zwiesel , Germany on Friday and Saturday and then capped off the weekend with a third place in the slalom on Sunday . 
Ghedina meanwhile , was cruising to his third downhill victory of the season and second in succession in Wengen to take the lead in the downhill standings from Frenchman Luc Alphand . 
Sweden &apos;s Pernilla Wiberg also had a productive weekend with a win in Sunday &apos;s slalom following earlier third and fourth places in giant slaloms . 
the results leave the softly-spoken Swede with a 328-point advantage over Germany &apos;s defending champion Katja Seizinger in the overall World Cup . 
Wiberg also moved closer to clinching the slalom World Cup title . 
with just three races remaining , she already has a 215-point lead over Compagnoni . 
Compagnoni , will be hoping to close that gap when the World Cup circuit moves to Cortina for four races this week , a downhill , super-G and two giant slaloms . 
&quot; I &apos;m going to Italy in a strong position , I &apos;m very happy about that , &quot; said Campagnoni , who has yet to claim a win on Italian snow . 
while Wiberg has constructed a comfortable advantage atop the women &apos;s rankings , Switzerland &apos;s giant slalom supremo Michael von Gruenigen clings to a slim five point lead over Norwegian all-rounder Kjetil Andre Aamodt in the men &apos;s standings . 
Austria &apos;s Thomas Sykora is just 24 points adrift , after he collected his fifth slalom victory of the season on Sunday . 
the lanky Austrian has dominated the slalom this season the same way Italian Alberto Tomba once did , winning five out of six races . 
the only blemish on his otherwise perfect record is a second place in Breckenridge . 
Tomba did not race in Wengen . 
the flamboyant Italian remained at home nursing the influenza that forced him out of the second leg of a giant slalom in Morzine , France last week . 
with his victory , Sykora consolidated his place at the top of the overall slalom standings with a near perfect 580 points . 
Thomas Stangassinger , who finished second behind his team mate for the third time this season , is a distant second with 360 points . 
Sykora can strengthen his claim to the title when the men move to Kitzbuehel for a downhill doubleheader and slalom this weekend . 
Alphand will also be looking forward to a return to the Austrian resort having recorded back-to-back downhill wins on the Streif two years ago . 
certainly the Frenchman will be happy to see the last of the Lauberhorn for a while after watching his team mate Adrien Duvillard airlifted unconscious from the course on Friday after a serious crash during final training . 
although still shaken by Duvillard &apos;s accident , Alphand was able to hold his concentration long enough to take second behind Ghedina on race day . 
while the win gave Ghedina a 20 point edge on Alphand in the battle for the downhill title , the 27-year-old Italian admitted it will be tough to maintain his position going into Kitzbuehel . 
&quot; I have 20 points now but we are going to Kitzbuehel and those are Alphand &apos;s races , &quot; said Ghedina . 
&quot; We have a big week ahead of us .
