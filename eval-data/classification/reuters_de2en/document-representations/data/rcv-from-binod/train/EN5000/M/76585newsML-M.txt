U.S. municipal bonds ended mixed to higher Tuesday , but market sources said no move by the Federal Reserve on interest rates should heighten handwringing over economic data and keep munis rangebound until after the November election . 
Municipals ended anywhere from mixed to up 3 / 8 of a point , players said . 
&quot; No Fed puts everything on hold and now you &apos;ve got to watch the economic numbers coming out , &quot; one trader said , adding that employment data as well and producer price index and consumer price index data will be closely watched . 
&quot; It probably delays whatever is going to happen until after the election , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; I think unfortunately we are going to get into this trading range type of mentality and the flow , which has been really difficult over the last couple of weeks , is just going to be more of the same . 
even if the Fed tightened by 25 basis points , the market would likely be similar straits , he said . 
the trader said while he believed the Fed would leave rates untouched because of the election , a 50 basis point tightening might have jumpstarted the municipal market . 
&quot; The best thing today from a business standpoint would have been to do it 50 , get the market to drop like a rock and get back to levels where people can do business , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Right now there is no incentive to do anything . 
the calendar remains light , bond funds lack cash and the stock market is &quot; sort of hanging around its highs , &quot; the trader said . 
after a malaise-bound summer , players thought activity would pickup after Labor Day but that failed to happen , the trader said . 
a municipal analyst said the Fed &apos;s decision to stand pat was &quot; a healthly thing . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think if you really thought about it that anybody would really wish for a 50 basis point change , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think ( the Fed is ) anxious to go , but it &apos;s too close to call and they &apos;ve got an election coming up . 
and though they are not political , if they did this and something happened , one or the other losing party would certainly be all over them in the future . 
the analyst said munis overall ended the day up 1 / 4 to 3 / 8 . 
dollar bonds opened flat , added 1 / 8 point by noon and rose another 1 / 8 point after the Fed &apos;s announcement to end 1 / 4 point higher . 
high-grade issues improved by two basis points . 
in debt futures , the December municipal contract closed at 113-20 / 32 , while the December T-bond contract closed at 108-20 / 32 . 
in the government market , the benchmark 30-year bond closed up 14 / 32 at 97-1 / 32 to yield 6.99 percent . 
turning to Wednesday &apos;s negotiated action , 24 deals totaling $ 925 million are expected . 
a $ 144 million Port of Portland , Oregon , offering via Goldman Sachs &amp; Co , heads the list . 
it is subject to the alternative minimum tax . 
also Wednesday , North Central Texas Health Facilities Corp is expected to sell $ 108 million bonds through Merrill Lynch &amp; Co , while Los Angeles Unified School District , Calif . , is scheduled to sell $ 94 million bonds via Bear Stearns &amp; Co . 
on the competitive side , eight sales are scheduled totaling $ 84.7 million . 
two Pittsburgh School District , Pa . , deals , one at $ 32.4 million and the other at $ 15.7 million , are scheduled for 1100 EDT Wednesday .
