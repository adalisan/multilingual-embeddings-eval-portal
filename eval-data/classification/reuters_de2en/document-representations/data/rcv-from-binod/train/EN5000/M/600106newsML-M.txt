interbank rates were generally firmer on expectations of a further liquidity tightness after a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bills issue on Tuesday , dealers said . 
results of the bills tender will be announced later today with payment on Wednesday . 
&quot; Rates are firming back ahead of the payment , &quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank . 
&quot; But I still think this will be temporary and rates should come off again as there are few maturities ( of Bank Negara bills ) coming . 
one- and two-week money were at 10.0 / 15.0 percent against 8.0 / 9.5 percent on Monday . 
one-month money was at 9.0 / 9.5 percent and three- and six-month at 8.0 / 8.5 percent . 
they were all quoted at 7.5 / 8.0 percent on Monday . 
dealers said the overnight rate was also expected to stay firm on Tuesday . 
it traded between 13 and 20 percent on Monday . 
the rise in interbank rates started last Thursday after Bank Negara intervened aggressively in the foreign exchange market to stem the slide of the ringgit . 
the central bank was said to have sold around $ 1 billion . 
the intervention drained liquidity from the system , causing the market to be short and interbank rates to rise to unusually high levels . 
interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange fell , losing some of their recent gains . 
at 0330 GMT , the benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank offered Rate ( KLIBOR ) June contract was down four points to 92.48 , or an implied yield of 7.52 percent . 
September was down two to 92.51 , or 7.49 percent .
