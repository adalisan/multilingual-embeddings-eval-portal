wall Street stocks held their gains at midday Thursday as Dow industrials extended their rally to a fourth day . 
today &apos;s move was in some ways more convincing than the Dow rally on Wednesday as there was greater broad market participation , including a solid showing by high techs , which have been weak for the last two days . 
the Dow industrials were up 22 points at 6702 , while advances led declines by 13 to nine on volume of about 241 million shares . 
the Nasdaq composite Index was up 12 points at 1222 . 
U.S. treasuries were higher , with the long bond up 20 / 32 to yield 7.05 percent . 
the Dow industrials rallied more than 280 points between Monday and Wednesday . 
today &apos;s steady bond market guaranteed a continuation of the action . 
but analysts point out that the biggest moves have been coming in the last hour , or even 30 minutes , when programs kick in . 
&quot; Today &apos;s rally is broader based . 
Techs are participating , and overall , the rally shows the market has resilience , &quot; said Jim Solloway , director of research at Argus Research .
