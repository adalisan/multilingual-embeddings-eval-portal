Indonesia &apos;s minority Moslem-oriented United Development Party ( PPP ) said on Friday it would decide at a meeting on June 5 whether it accepts the outcome of general elections won easily by the ruling Golkar . 
&quot; We will take the final decision on June 5 , &quot; PPP campaign manager Jusuf Sjakir told a news conference . 
the PPP had 23.47 percent of the ballots counted by mid-afternoon on Friday , compared with 73.61 percent for Golkar , in power for most of President Suharto &apos;s 30-year rule , and under three percent for the only other legal party , the fragmented Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) . 
political and financial analysts have expressed concern over a possible recurrence of violence if PPP supporters felt they were cheated at the polls on Thursday and refused to accept the results . 
the campaign leading to the vote saw the worst political violence in three decades , much of it between partisans of the PPP and Golkar . 
Sjakir said there had been an increased number of irregularities during voting for the 425 elected seats in the House of Representatives and for regional and local assemblies . 
he said there had also been signs of &quot; vote buying &quot; in some government offices dominated by Golkar . 
Sjakir also said the PPP was considering asking for fresh elections in places where the votes had not been counted on the spot as legally required , but taken to sub-district offices . 
he added the PPP had not yet decided whether to challenge election irregularities in the courts . 
the PPP won 17 percent of the vote in the last elections in 1992 compared to 68 percent for Golkar .
