the key December three-month Euroyen futures contract was firmer in line with rises in yen bond prices by midday on Monday , but traders said its buoyancy was limited amid a lack of fresh buying incentives . 
&quot; December should have risen more , given that it smoothly rose to 99.00 on the CME on Friday , &quot; a European bank trader said . 
however , it failed to extend gains due to a lack of fresh buying incentives , he added . 
December was at 98.98 at the end of the morning session , compared with Friday &apos;s settlement of 98.95 . 
most of the gains were in response to firmer Japanese government bond prices .
