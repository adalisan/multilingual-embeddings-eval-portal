the IMF board meets on Friday to discuss ways to help the world &apos;s poorest nations but it remains unclear whether it will endorse a controversial proposal to sell off some of its gold to help in the process . 
supporters said they expected the International Monetary Fund to back the sale of gold if that proves necessary in the future to finance IMF initiatives to help the world &apos;s poor . 
opponents said the most that is likely is an agreement to examine the possibility of gold sales , among other financing alternatives , in the future if that is needed . 
IMF management , backed by the United States , Britain and most other member nations , has proposed selling around 5 percent of its more than 100 million ounces of gold to help finance its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility ( ESAF ) . 
the proposal to buttress the ESAF , which lends money to the world &apos;s poorest nations at virtually no interest charge , dovetails with another multilateral initiative to provide debt relief to some of those same countries . 
international monetary sources said IMF managment has assured member nations that any gold sales would be carried out in such a way as to minimise their impact on the market . 
under IMF rules , 85 percent of the total voting power of the agency &apos;s member countries is required before gold can be sold . 
Germany has led the opposition to the IMF gold sales plan , arguing that such a move would set a bad precedent and that the gold should only be used in the case of financial emergencies . 
&quot; Our position is that we will not agree to sales of gold , &quot; a German source said . 
Italy and Switzerland also oppose gold sales . 
together with Germany , they hold 12.32 percent of the votes of the IMF . 
while that on its own is not enough to block the proposal , opponents of the plan said they expect enough other countries to abstain from voting on the scheme to deny supporters the needed 85 percent majority . 
they see no urgency in deciding on the gold sales issue as the ESAF has enough money to continue in operation to 1999 or beyond . 
the ESAF also has enough money to finance at least one multilateral debt reduction programme , probably for Uganda , without an agreement on additional funding methods , they said .
