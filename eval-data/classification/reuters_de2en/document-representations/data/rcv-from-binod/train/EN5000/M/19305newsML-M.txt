a rally in oil prices was a main feature of fairly subdued commodity markets overnight 
oil prices rallied again with the help of news of a draw in U.S. stocks of refined oil products after surrendering on Tuesday some recent sharp gains . 
London October futures for North Sea benchmark Brent Blend crude oil at 1645 GMT were up by almost 40 cents a barrel at around $ 20.40 . 
the NYMEX oil complex closed higher mostly on bullish inventory data , but gasoline led gains with the threat that Tropical Storm Fran will head toward the Hess refinery on St. Croix in the Carribean , traders said . 
October crude oil closed up 15 cents to $ 21.69 barrel , retreating from its intraday high of $ 22.10 . 
a report that Iraq may be massing troops in northern Kurdish regions fueled crude &apos;s gains during the day , traders said . 
gold ended in London unchanged from Tuesday at $ 388.55 per ounce , while New York precious metals futures ended lower , slipping back after the monthly OTC options expiry .

in New York bullion trade , spot gold was quoted at $ 387.90 / 388.40 from a New York close Tuesday at $ 388.80 / 389.20 . 
copper was trapped in a band on the London Metal Exchange , barely reacting to news that workers at Chile state producer Codelco &apos;s Salvador mine voted to strike from Saturday to demand wage rises . 
output at this mine is only a modest 85,000 tonnes a year . 
last afternoon business was at $ 1,943 a tonne , down just $ 1 from Tuesday .

the last trade was at $ 1,486.50 , a $ 4.50 gain . 
nickel business was confined to a narrow range as well , with prices edging towards the highs to close at $ 7,350 , a $ 10 gain from Tuesday .

tin market conditions were equally slow , but prices held steady on the kerb , closing at an unchanged $ 6,175 . 
Alloy was $ 7 higher at $ 1,285 . 
Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) wheat futures closed lower on competition for U.S. export business amid increasing prospects for global wheat production , traders said . 
&quot; There are bigger wheat crops coming in all over the world and that &apos;s weighing on wheat . 
no one wants it right now , &quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds . 
pressure also came from good harvest weather for the U.S. spring wheat crop and prospects for heavy deliveries to be posted against the September Friday , first notice day for deliveries on the September contracts . 
wheat closed 1-1 / 2 to 10-3 / 4 cents per bushel lower , with September down seven at $ 4.51-1 / 4 .
