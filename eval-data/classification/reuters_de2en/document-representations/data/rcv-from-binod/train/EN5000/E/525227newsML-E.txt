following are economists &apos; reactions to the preliminary 0.3 month on month rise in Italian April CPI and the 1.8 percent year on year rate estimated after six cities &apos; inflation data released on Monday . 
analysts in a Reuters survey had forecast on average a monthly rate of 0.2 percent and yearly rate of 1.8 percent . 
Alessandro Fugnoli , strategist at Caboto brokers , said : &quot; The market is expecting a rate cut this week . 
the Bank of Italy has the room to cut but it will also have the room in May and June . 
the window of opportunity will last more than a month . 
asked how big he expected the cut to be , he said , &quot; Probably 50 basis points , the Bank from now on will be very careful . 
Naples , Venice , Turin , Milan , Trieste and Bari announced their preliminary April data on Monday . 
the other five sample cities will issue their figures at 1530 GMT on Tuesday . 
the final official figure will be issued on May 6 . 
Marco Pianelli at Nomura London told Reuters Financial Television , &quot; This is clearly good news . 
there is a chance that the month by month rise will be 0.1 percent which will take the year by year figure to 1.7 . 
&quot; I think the Bank is clearly going to ease but there is no urgency to do it today . 
they want to make sure that the market is at ease with a rate cut and they may wait till the final data is out on May 6 , &quot; he said . 
Lucia Trevisan of Caboto agreed that Tuesday &apos;s cities &apos; data could be better than expected , giving an overall year-on-year rate of 1.7 percent . 
&quot; Today &apos;s figures are a conflicting , &quot; said Alfredo Granata of Banca di Roma , noting a month on month rise of 0.3 percent in Milan and a monthly 0.6 fall in Trieste . 
&quot; I imagine the cities due on Tuesday , like Florence and Bologna , will come in along the lines of Milan so confirming an annual 1.8 percent rate . 
but there &apos;s still the possibility of seeing 0.1 percent monthly and 1.7 percent yearly , &quot; he said . 
Caboto &apos;s Trevisan said although the data looked good it did not automatically mean the central bank would move immediately to cut rates . 
early elections in France could in fact weaken the lira via the French franc , &quot; she said .
