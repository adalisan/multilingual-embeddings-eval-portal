Senator Bob Smith announced on Monday that he would do everything in his power to prevent the prompt confirmation of the first U.S. ambassador to post-war Vietnam . 
under Senate rules , Smith , a New Hampshire Republican , may stall an ambassadorial nomination indefinitely . 
former Representative Douglas &quot; Pete &quot; Peterson , once a prisoner of war in Vietnam , had been widely expected to take up his Hanoi post by next month . 
Smith said that he would use his power to block a Senate vote pending the outcome of investigations into whether U.S. policy toward Vietnam had been improperly influenced by illegal foreign campaign contributions to President Bill Clinton &apos;s 1996 re-election campaign . 
&quot; At a time when there are so many disturbing reports which cast doubt on the administration &apos;s publicly stated rationale for moving forward with Communist Vietnam over the last four years , I believe it would be irresponsible for the Senate to just go ahead and approve the president &apos;s request that we put a U.S. ambassador in Hanoi , and allow Hanoi to do the same in Washington , &quot; he told the American Legion . 
he said he would hold matters up until Congress could get the testimony of John Huang , a former Commerce Department official and Democratic party fund-raiser who is fighting a supboena to testify before a Senate panel . 
&quot; Let me be clear : right now , John Huang is refusing to testify before Congress , &quot; Smith said . 
&quot; No testimony , no ambassador . 
it &apos;s that simple .
