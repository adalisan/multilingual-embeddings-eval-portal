John Collins &apos; telling performance and winning goal in Monaco &apos;s table topping 1-0 win at Montpellier marked the Scotland midfielder &apos;s growing influence in Jean Tigana &apos;s side . 
Monaco lorded it at the top of the French first division table on Friday -- at least until Paris St Germain &apos;s evening visit to Caen -- after Collins , running the midfield in the absence of suspended playmaker Ali Benarbia , stole the show on Thursday night . 
the team from the principality went two points clear of PSG who had led without interruption since September . 
Collins was in the box to sidefoot into the net a low cross from Nigerian Victor Ikpeba in the 51st minute , and a minute later found himself at the other end clearing a header by Montpellier &apos;s Ibrahim Bakayoko off the Monaco line . 
&quot; We all worked together and that &apos;s what &apos;s vital , &quot; said the former Glasgow Celtic player . 
&quot; We mustn &apos;t forget that we were handicapped by the absence of several players . 
in these conditions , it &apos;s a super result that we got at Montpellier . 
&quot; I hope Paris ( PSG ) are upset at Caen so we can ( remain ) leaders of the championship for the first time this season . 
it was Collins &apos; third league goal for Monaco . 
he also scored in the 4-2 demolition of Borussia Moenchengladbach in the second round of the UEFA Cup . 
Monaco travel to Hamburg on Tuesday for the second leg of their third round tie with a 3-0 advantage after the home leg .
