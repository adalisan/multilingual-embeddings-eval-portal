the rise in the dollar and the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates are causing Japanese investors to take a more cautious stance toward U.S. bond investments , market participants said on Thursday . 
&quot; Japanese investors still want to buy treasuries very much , but not right now , &quot; said a senior trader at a Japanese brokerage . 
&quot; The dollar &apos;s rapid rise has forced them to take a more careful attitude , &quot; he said . 
the dollar climbed to its highest levels against the yen in nearly five years partly on the belief that Japanese investors would continue shifting funds abroad , given the growing interest rate gap between the United States and Japan . 
what sparked the dollar &apos;s latest rally was a conviction among many traders that the U.S. will not use currency rates as a tool to resolve trade problems , prompted by comments by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in a visit to Tokyo last week . 
the dollar rose above 127 yen on Thursday for the first time since August 1992 , from around 122 to 123 yen last week . 
investors are reluctant to purchase U.S. treasuries when exchange rates are volatile . 
the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates has also added to their skittishness . 
sporadic purchases of shorter- and medium-term treasuries have been detected among private investors and smaller institutional investors , such as trust funds and smaller life insurers . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been hearing about Japanese buying , but we haven &apos;t actually seen major buying , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; Some institutional investors are buying in small volumes , but many Japanese heavyweight investors are currently sidelined . 
record low interest rates in Japan and a growing consensus that the dollar will not tumble against the yen should attract foreign investment by Japanese , but they need to be sure about the trend of the dollar before extending their purchases . 
&quot; With the interest rate gap widening between Japan and the United States and the gap likely to stay that way , it &apos;s a natural attitude to shift funds outside , &quot; said Masanori Mizoguchi , general manager at the securities investment section at Nippon Dantai Life Insurance . 
&quot; I believe there are more risks buying JGBs than worrying about currency risks . 
with the yield of the key 10-year JGB crawling slightly above two percent ... many people should be feeling the way I do , &quot; Mizoguchi said . 
Mizoguchi , however , said the dollar &apos;s volatility has prompted investors to take a wait-and-see stance . 
&quot; Even though the current rise of the dollar has been within our expectations , I think the rise is too fast . 
we are considering selling dollars at around 128 yen as the market may correct the greenback downward if it approaches 130 yen . 
Mizoguchi said the the dollar should stay bullish in the longer term and it was highly unlikely that it would fall below 120 yen . 
other investors agreed , given the prospect that interest rate differentials could widen further . 
&quot; I don &apos;t expect the dollar to jump sharply , but more importantly , there is strong consensus that the dollar is unlikely to take a dive , &quot; a senior foreign bond and forex section manager at a major life insurance firm said . 
traders said that the investors will limit their buying to as little as possible until they can determine the trends of the Treasury market and the dollar .
