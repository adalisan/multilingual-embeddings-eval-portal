British and Irish officials on Sunday denied media speculation that troubled multi-party talks on British-ruled Northern Ireland may soon fold permanently . 
on the eve of a rare round-table session between bitterly divided politicians , the officials said the talks would probably be put on hold during this year &apos;s British general election campaign , but pledged a resumption would follow the poll . 
U.S. envoy George Mitchell , a former senator who chairs the talks , will be in Belfast on Monday to convene a plenary session , the first since before adjournment in late December . 
but political analysts say the prospects for progress are being blighted by several factors . 
worsening guerrilla violence , pre-election rivalry between British political parties and uncertainty over whether pro-British Loyalist parties will be expelled from the talks for links with guerrilla groups have caused a logjam , they say . 
&quot; It is anticipated that there will be a postponement of the talks around the general election time , &quot; a spokesman for Britain &apos;s Northern Ireland Office said . 
he said Prime Minister John Major had pledged that , after the election , which must be held no later than May 22 , he would pursue the peace process vigorously . 
an Irish government source said : &quot; All sides will want to keep the talks alive so that they can be resuscitated properly after the British general election . 
the London-based Sunday Times reported that the talks , which have limped along since June , would be suspended within four weeks to allow the region &apos;s parties to prepare for the election . 
it said officials in London , Dublin and Washington had warned that the ailing peace process may never be resumed . 
it quoted American sources as saying Mitchell was &quot; disillusioned by lack of progress and failure to secure a new IRA ( Irish Republican Army ) ceasefire &quot; . 
early on Sunday three British soldiers escaped serious injury in a bomb attack at Ballynahinch south of Belfast which security sources blamed on IRA guerrillas opposed to British rule . 
a spate of IRA attacks since December has provoked three retaliatory strikes by pro-British Loyalists on Roman Catholic nationalists and Sunday &apos;s incident raised fears of more &quot; blow- for-blow &quot; attacks . 
moderate nationalist leader John Hume says he will continue to talk to the IRA &apos;s Sinn Fein political wing to try to secure a new ceasefire . 
politicians from the pro-British Protestant majority are convinced the IRA is wedded to violence . 
but Martin McGuinness , Sinn Fein &apos;s chief negotiator , said on Sunday the peace process could not move forward ahead of the British election , and the main hope was that Major would lose . 
&quot; There is going to be a new British government ... and I hope that we can then move decisively to get rid of all the delaying and the stalling , &quot; he told British independent television . 
last week Major conceded that a three-year drive to end the region &apos;s long-running conflict had hit &quot; a sticky patch &quot; . 
he says Sinn Fein will be allowed into talks if there is a full end to IRA violence , but Sinn Fein accuses Major of isolating it to secure votes from Unionist MPs who are crucial to his ability to see out his term of office . 
Britain believes that a 28-month Loyalist truce is strained though intact but has warned Loyalist parties that further attacks could lead to their expulsion from the talks .
