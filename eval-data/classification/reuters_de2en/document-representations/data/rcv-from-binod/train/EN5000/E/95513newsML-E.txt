the Bank of Spain cut its official money market rate to 6.75 percent from 7.25 percent on Thursday , the sixth reduction in its key rate this year . 
all 10 analysts polled by Reuters on Wednesday had expected the central bank to cut today , but they were divided on whether the cut would be 25 or 50 basis points . 
following are analysts views on the cut : 
&quot; As expected , the Bank of Spain cut rates . 
we had expected a smaller reduction but it &apos;s not that surprising . 
the move &apos;s been taken well . 
&quot; They had scope to cut one-half point and they took advantage of it . 
the Bundesbank &apos;s cut in August gave the Bank of Spain room . 
&quot; My impression is that there is more scope ( some 25 basis points ) left this year . 
the presentation of the budget must have satisfied the Bank of Spain . 
&quot; This means that once the Bank of Spain analised the budget they saw it optimistically . 
this supports the budget . 
I would take it as a sign that with the small amount of time ( the government ) has had they &apos;ve done well . 
&quot; I would expect that at about the time of the next inflation data they may give us another 25 basis points in cuts . 
there continue to be expectations of a cut but we will have to wait for inflation and growth data .
