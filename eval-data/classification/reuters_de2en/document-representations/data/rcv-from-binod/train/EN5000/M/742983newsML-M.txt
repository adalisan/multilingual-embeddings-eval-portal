CSCE cocoa futures ended down sharply on Monday , as heavy long liquidation by speculators drove prices to near six-week lows , dealers said . 
&quot; It was mass liquidation , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The market seems to be focusing on only bearish news and the charts are quite bearish . 
benchmark September cocoa ended down $ 36 per tonne , at $ 1,504 -- its lowest settlement since June 10 -- after ranging from $ 1,521 to $ 1,498 . 
Second-month December also fell $ 36 , to close at $ 1,552 , while the back months finished $ 33 lower . 
speculators , led by commodity funds , pressured the market from the opening bell . 
a sharp decline in London cocoa weighed on the market , with New York &apos;s benchmark September contract gapping down $ 34 a tonne at the outset . 
London cocoa futures tumbled nearly four percent on Monday to four-month lows , with most-active LIFFE September ending 30 stg lower , at 984 stg , after trading in a 1,012-977 stg range . 
&quot; It followed London , &quot; said Refco Inc analyst Ann Prendergast , adding , &quot; I think the ( Ivorian ) new crop is looking better than first expected . 
although Prendergast said the release of the next round of crop estimates was some three weeks away , Ivorian crop analysts and regional buyers said on Monday that the country &apos;s 1997 / 98 cocoa crop ( Oct-Sept ) is developing strongly with large harvests possible if favorable weather continues into August . 
additionally , dealers said the latest CFTC Commitment of Traders report , which showed speculators ( non-commercials and nonreportables ) were net long 24,281 lots as of July 15 , may have dampened sentiment . 
while the CFTC data was generally in line with expectations -- and did not include Thursday &apos;s sell-off -- some traders said the large speculative net long position heightened the bearish mood . 
&quot; Specs didn &apos;t get out that much and open interest is still high , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; I figure specs are still net long 21,000 or 20,000 and that &apos;s still pretty big . 
total open interest as of Friday stood at 101,065 lots , down 337 lots from the previous session . 
technically , dealers said September appeared to find good support today near $ 1,500 . 
after that level , they pegged support at $ 1,486 . 
resistance was seen at the remainder of chart gap $ 1,521 to $ 1,525 . 
volume reached an estimated 9,995 lots .
