MEPs worried about the fate of Hong Kong after it returns to Chinese rule this summer are due to call on February 20 for European passports for all Hong Kong citizens . 
&quot; It will be a political signal that we won &apos;t let the people of Hong Kong down , &quot; Belgian Radical Alliance MEP Olivier Dupuis told Reuters . 
the non-binding resolution is also expected to demand that the EU follow the United States &apos; line and require its representative in Hong Kong to produce an annual report on the human rights situation there . 
in the meantime , MEPs want Hong Kong governor Chris Patten to come to the European Parliament and set out in detail the problems associated with Britain &apos;s handover of the territory to Beijing . 
Dupuis said he had received no answer to a request for European Union trade commissioner Leon Brittan to tell parliament how the European Commission would react if China violated human rights in Hong Kong after the handover . 
British Liberal Graham Watson is to lead a delegation of five MEPs , including Dupuis , to Hong Kong in March . 
&quot; I want to send a message to Hong Kong and the Council ( of Ministers ) that the European Parliament does not regard this as a British matter but as a European matter , &quot; Watson said . 
&quot; Hong Kong is of concern to every country in the EU , &quot; he continued , adding that Germany , Britain , France and Italy had all made significant investments in the territory . 
Watson said that in the end , no one could stop the Chinese authorities replacing the existing elected legislature in Hong Kong with a new appointed body , in breach of a 1984 Sino-British agreement . 
but the EU could make support for China &apos;s accession to the World Trade Organisation dependent on respect for human rights in Hong Kong . 
&quot; It &apos;s more in China &apos;s interest to be in the WTO than in the West &apos;s ( interest ) . 
China needs access to Western technology , Western capital and Western markets , &quot; he reasoned . 
Watson said he supported the call to give all Hong Kong people citizenship of an EU member state . 
but he deplored as a cynical election move the British government &apos;s recent decision to issue British passports to Hong Kong citizens , mostly of Indian origin , who will become stateless when the territory returns to China . 
&quot; It &apos;s a cynical election appeal to the Indian community ( in Britain ) to vote conservative , &quot; Watson said .
