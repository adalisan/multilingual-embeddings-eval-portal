Tokyo naphtha prices slithered down in subdued afternoon trade on Monday amid a lack of market direction except for a moderate overseas crude loss on Friday , market participants said . 
some traders were said to be in holiday mood ahead of a series of Japanese holidays scheduled this week and early next week , and others had already left their offices for the break . 
&quot; Singapore has a holiday Thursday as well , so whole week is quite fragmented , &quot; a trader said . 
First-half July open-spec naphtha was assessed at $ 208.50 / 210.00 per tonne , down from Friday &apos;s $ 210.00 / 211.00 . 
in spreads , first-half July / first-half August was traded at plus $ 1.00 , indicating the first-half July contract was valued $ 1.00 per tonne higher than first-half August . 
in term negotiations , Saudi Arabia is expected to notify its potential naphtha buyers of detailed scheduled for one-on-one talks to be held in Singapore by May 3 . 
Aramco said last week that negotiations for term cargoes to be loaded in the second half of 1997 would be held in Singapore in the third week of May , without setting a specific meeting date for each buyer . 
at least eight Japanese firms and one South Korean refiner are expected to take part in the talks .
