Long-dated Australian bonds gave up some ground against the dollar bloc after Friday &apos;s strong outperformance in the wake of the Reserve Bank &apos;s unexpected official interest rate easing . 
the Australian / U.S. 
10-year bond yield spread had contracted briefly to around 75 basis points on Friday and its lowest level in three years , but subsequent profit-taking both locally and offshore saw this differential widen slightly . 
meanwhile , the short end held its ground and saw the local yield curve steepen further , and the three / 10-year bond futures spread has put on some 15 basis points since the rate cut . 
U.S. Treasury yields showed an easier bias during Friday &apos;s pre-holiday shortened session . 
U.S. markets are closed today for Memorial Day . 
Canadian debt was little changed on Friday , while the New Zealand yield curve steepened ahead of Tuesday &apos;s N.Z.
