the Austrian Tennis Federation ( OTV ) on Monday gave its full backing to world number three Thomas muster for leading the Davis Cup team &apos;s walkout from the weekend &apos;s world group qualifying tie against Brazil . 
OTV president Gerd Purner said an appeal would be made to the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) about the crowd behaviour in Sao Paolo which led to muster storming off court during the doubles tie , the Austrian news agency APA said . 
a furious muster told Austrian television ORF the Brazilian crowd continually insulted him and his doubles partner Udo Plamberger and also spat and threw small stones onto the court . 
the Austrian team also pulled out of the reverse singles and flew home a day early , forfeiting the matches and giving Brazil a 4-1 win . 
&quot; We fully respect muster &apos;s decision . 
he is the world &apos;s number three and he is also a level-headed person , &quot; Purner said . 
&quot; We will be sending a written statement to the ITF about the matter and I don &apos;t believe they will ban us from Davis Cup competition . 
Purner said the OTV would also file complaints about the bad surface of the court and the poor quality of the television coverage . 
&quot; We should be able to expect a certain level of professionalism in the Davis Cup , &quot; he said .
