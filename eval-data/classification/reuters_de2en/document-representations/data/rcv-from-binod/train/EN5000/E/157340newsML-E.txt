Germany &apos;s low level of investment in India is cause for concern , Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Thursday . 
Chidambaram told German business leaders that German firms accounted for 134 of the 1,289 projects involving foreign equity participation which India approved between August 1991 and January 1996 . 
of 2,797 cases approved by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board between August 1991 and May 1996 , German firms accounted for 215 projects , he told the Sixth Asia-Pacific Conference of German Industry and Trade . 
&quot; German investment in India has been quite low , &quot; Chidambaram said . 
&quot; A cause for concern is that the share of German investments as a proportion of global foreign direct investment flows has declined considerably . 
Chidambaram did not provide any figures showing a decline in German investment . 
the Indian finance minister said German firms were more active in collaborating with Indian companies . 
he said there were 1,230 such business &quot; collaborations &quot; today , including some 400 joint ventures . 
&quot; While the level of German investment is low today , I am confident that it will increase in the future , &quot; he said . 
Chidambaram said large , well-known German firms were well-established in India and encouraged medium-sized firms to set down roots .
