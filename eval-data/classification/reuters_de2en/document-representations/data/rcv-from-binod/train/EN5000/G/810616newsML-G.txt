American Kelly Robbins 
overpowered the Glen Abbey course on Friday to take the 
halfway lead in the 1.2 million dollar du Maurier classic , the 
final major of the women &apos;s golf season . 
with nine birdies in an eight-under-par 65 , the 27 
year-old Robbins finished with a 10-under-par 136 , two shots 
ahead of Sweden &apos;s Liselotte Neumann . 
American Juli Inkster was 
in third place , another shot back . 
four Americans -- Rosie Jones , Donna Andrews , Betsy King 
and Colleen Walker -- finished at six-under-par 140 . 
with the fast-running conditions suiting the long-hitter , 
Robbins , who has won twice this season and is third in the 
order of Merit with $ 615,169 , made birdies on all five long 
holes . 
&quot; The course is playing really short , and the greens were 
holding well , so conditions were ideal for the long hitters , &quot; 
said Robbins . 
conditions to her liking . 
starting at the 10th , she opened 
with three successive birdies , and had seven in all . 
&quot; I &apos;m using a new putter , three new wedges and a different 
golf ball this week . 
it &apos;s a Bridgestone Tour precept which is 
softer and easier to control on the short shots , &quot; said 
Neumann . 
&quot; The course is playing very easy , and I think it will take 
around 18 under par to win , which would be very low for a 
major . 
Laura Davies , the defending champion from Britain , shot a 
70 and finished seven behind on three under par 143 . 
starting at the 10th , she had a brilliant spell of an 
eagle -- she hit a nine-iron second shot to a foot at the 
466-yard , par five 16th -- and five birdies in eight holes . 
two shocking casualties of the cut were Sweden &apos;s world 
number 1 Annika Srenstam . 
she missed by two strokes on 150 
after a 77 . 
Alison Nicholas , who carded a 74 , one too many on 149 .
