U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry faced hostile Russian legislators in a harsh two-hour exchange on nuclear arms cuts on Thursday , apparently doing little to reverse overwhelming opposition to the START-2 treaty . 
using Russian-language charts and financial arguments , Perry pressed members of the State Duma , parliament &apos;s lower house , to ratify the strategic arms reduction treaty which would slash U.S. and Russian warheads to about 3,000 on each side by 2003 . 
but U.S. and Russian officials said afterwards that START-2 remained in deep trouble , in large measure because of differences over planned NATO expansion into eastern Europe , despite ratification by the U.S. Senate earlier this year . 
&quot; ratification of START-2 is quite problematic , it is not in the interest of the Russian side , &quot; Duma defence committee chairman Lev Rokhlin told Perry , who testified it would be cheaper to destroy warheads than maintain huge arsenals . 
&quot; Russians are disappointed with tendencies emerging in America , and it would be difficult to convince the Russian public that the United States is friendly and has peaceful intentions towards Russia , &quot; Vladimir Lukin , chairman of the Duma &apos;s international committee , said after the meeting . 
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters that there was a lot of suspicion . 
&quot; This ( convincing the Duma ) is going to be an uphill fight . 
there is no doubt about it , &quot; he said . 
Perry said only that it was &quot; an excellent and productive discussion &quot; on START-2 , which would cut U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals to about 3,000 warheads on from current levels of over 6,000 each . 
that would be a third of Cold War levels . 
but a number of Russian legislators , including communist leader Gennady Zyuganov , voiced continuing suspicion of Start-2 and repeated fierce opposition to planned expansion by NATO into eastern Europe . 
Perry insisted the two issues were not linked . 
the Russian economy and its military forces are in disarray and many Russian officials fear that cutting nuclear weapons deeply would leave Moscow open to blackmail from the West . 
they also fear NATO enlargement , expected to include offers of membership to former Communist states Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic next year , would threaten Russia &apos;s security . 
&quot; I believe the START-2 treaty is fair and gives neither side an advantage , &quot; Perry told Duma members in a speech before he was bombarded by hostile questions on U.S.-Russian relations and NATO . 
he said the warheads remaining under START-2 would be &quot; enough to destroy the world &quot; and &quot; more than enough deterrence &quot; for Russia . 
the treaty would eliminate Russia &apos;s big multiple-warhead SS-18 intercontinental missiles and leave each country with only single-warhead land-based missiles and multiple-warhead missiles based aboard subarines . 
Perry tried to brush aside suspicion by some questioners that that the United States might develop new and better single-warhead land-based intercontinental missiles if the treaty was ratified . 
&quot; Both of us know that fewer nuclear weapons in the world makes us all safer . 
&quot; he added . 
&quot; Why would we want more missiles ? 
we already have more warheads and missiles than we need . 
Republican U.S. 
Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut said the questioning was harsh and showed deep suspicion of U.S. motives after the Cold War . 
Lieberman quipped that Perry , who faced recent tough questioning from the U.S. Senate Armed Service Committee on peacekeeping in Bosnia , would now welcome such exchanges as mild after Thursday &apos;s session .
