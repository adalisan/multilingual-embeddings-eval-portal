Dutch bonds ended higher on Wednesday , back close to two-month peaks after surprisingly weak U.S inflation data boosted Europe , but the local market remained bedevilled by very low turnover , dealers said . 
guilders rallied with Bunds after a drop of 0.6 percent in the April U.S. producer price index -- the biggest fall since August 1993 -- after standing mixed and nearly motionless for most of the day . 
the slightly heavy Dutch market again underperformed Germany on the way up , though , with the 10-year yield discount shaving another two basis points after narrowing on Tuesday . 
the upmove was not paired with any significant cash trade , dealers said , with investors uninterested at current levels . 
&quot; Interest rates are low and seen rising , &quot; one said . 
&quot; In that environment it is just too expensive at the moment . 
there are no buyers and probably won &apos;t be until we see higher yields . 
a yield level of six percent on the 10-year benchmark would likely mark the point where institutions might return , he said . 
the 5.75 percent February 2007 issue settled with a yield of 5.57 percent on Wednesday . 
the market shrugged off news on the Dutch state &apos;s 1997 funding requirements . 
the finance ministry &apos;s capital markets agency said on Wednesday that 10 billion guilders of its 1997 borrowing requirement still remained to be raised . 
the agency also said in its spring memorandum that the forecast 1997 Dutch budget deficit had been cut to 18.6 billion guilders from a previously estimated 21 billion . 
&quot; It was already pretty much discounted in the market , although 10 billion seems a little low to me , &quot; a broker said . 
&quot; It is pretty sad for the liquidity of the Dutch market . 
dealers said the tight supply situation has been driving big players to switch into Germany . 
&quot; The less supply there is here , the more the institutions are going to buy Bunds , &quot; one said . 
&quot; It may get even quieter over here .
