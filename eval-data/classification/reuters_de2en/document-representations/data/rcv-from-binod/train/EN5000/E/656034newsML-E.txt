the growth rate of economies in central Europe and the Baltic states is likely to be between 3.5 and 5.5 percent this year , against an average of four percent in 1996 , the Polish government &apos;s analitical unit said in a report . 
the Centre for Strategic Studies ( CSS ) said the region would benefit from a better economic climate in European Union countries over the next two years but that central European states are likely to grow faster than the Baltics . 
&quot; The growth will be fuelled by investment and improving work efficiency helped by the inflow of foreign capital , &quot; the report , released on Thursday said . 
it said Croatia was likely to have the lowest inflation in the region at four percent with the Czech Republic , Macedonia , Slovakia and Slovenia at an expected 10 percent or lower . 
the report also expects a further fall of inflaton in Poland , Hungary and the Baltic states , but noted high internal demand would make curbing price growth difficult . 
the internal demand , although the main source of economic growth , was also responsible for the deterioration of the region &apos;s trade and current account balance , the report said . 
the report also said the region &apos;s exports , consisting mainly of labour-intensive goods and raw materials , would remain competitive only as long as labour costs in these countries stay well below EU levels .
