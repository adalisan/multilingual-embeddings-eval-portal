the pace of rises in Japan &apos;s trade surplus is likely to slow from the autumn , Economic Planning Agency Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday . 
Aso told a news conference that rises in Japan &apos;s trade surplus in the April-June period had been large but that these increases had been predicted and were not that much of a surprise . 
asked if the trade surplus would continue to rise dramatically from the autumn , Aso said : &quot; It is hard to think that the surplus will rise with its current vigour . 
he added that the yen had risen one yen to the dollar overnight and that a rise of one yen could make a large difference to some firms .
