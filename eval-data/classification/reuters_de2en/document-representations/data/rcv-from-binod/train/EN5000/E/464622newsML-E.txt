the British economy faces a bumpy ride over the next two years , with growth strengthening in the short term but likely to be curbed later this year by the strength of sterling , Oxford Economic Forecasting said . 
short-term growth would be boosted by buoyant consumer demand due to tax cuts , continued low interest rates , rapidly falling unemployment and building society windfalls , it said . 
the organisation forecast that consumption would grow 4.2 percent in 1997 , with spending on durables up over 10 percent on the back of the reviving housing market and house price inflation likely to approach 10 percent in the spring . 
&quot; But growth is likely to be curbed later in the year by sterling &apos;s continued rally , &quot; it said . 
&quot; With the exchange rate up 15 percent since last August , both cost and price competitiveness now appear as unfavourable as during the UK &apos;s membershp of the ERM . 
the forecasting group said that with strong domestic demand boosting imports , net trade is likely to be a serious drag on GDP , with the current account deficit up to six billion stg in 1997 from 1.5 billion last year . 
&quot; Sterling &apos;s appreciation is also likely to undermine the investment recovery as output expectations are scaled back and exporters &apos; profit margins are severely squeezed , &quot; it said . 
&quot; Investment rose by only two percent through 1996 and we expect it to expand by just 3-1 / 2 percent this year , with the investment-GDP ratio at its lowest since 1983 , undermining longer-term growth prospects . 
the impact of the strong pound on exports was likely to be felt most in 1998 . 
&quot; Personal incomes will no longer benefit from tax cuts . 
and demand will also be hit by higher interest rates after the election . 
as a result , we expect GDP growth of just 1.8 percent in 1998 , with manufacturing output rising by less than one percent . 
this compares with the 3.1 percent GDP growth which the Oxford group forecasts for this year . 
it said it expected official interest rates to peak at 6.75 percent in the second half of 1997 compared with 6.0 percent at present , with rate cuts likely in 1998 to bolster growth . 
underlying inflation ( RPIX ) was likely to peak at 3.3 percent in mid-1998 before falling back under three percent in the medium term .
