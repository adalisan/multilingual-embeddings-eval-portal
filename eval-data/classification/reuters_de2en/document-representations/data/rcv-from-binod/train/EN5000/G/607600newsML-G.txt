Turkey &apos;s ruling Islamists said on Thursday they would take legal action against the country &apos;s top prosecutor for attempting to close Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan &apos;s Welfare Party as a threat to the secular order . 
&quot; We will bring him to court . 
he produced unlawful and groundless documents against us , &quot; State Minister Abdullah Gul told Reuters . 
top prosecutor Vural Savas said on Wednesday he had filed a case with the constitutional court to outlaw Welfare on the grounds that it endangered the basic tenets of the secularist Turkish state . 
on Tuesday Erbakan &apos;s government narrowly survived a parliamentary challenge over charges of straying from the secularist path set out at the founding of modern Turkey in 1923 . 
legal sources said it could take at least six months for a verdict in any court case aimed at closing Welfare . 
Erbakan has upset the secularist elite , led by the army , with plans for limited Islamist reforms since he became NATO member Turkey &apos;s first Islamist leader in modern times last June .
