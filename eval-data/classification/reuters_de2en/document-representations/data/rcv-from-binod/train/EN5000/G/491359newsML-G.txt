President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met on Monday to seek ways to revive the stalled Middle East peace process . 
&quot; I think it is very important to get this peace process back on track , &quot; Clinton said at the start of the meeting in the Oval Office . 
&quot; I want to have this chance to ... discuss what we can do to get it going again , &quot; Clinton said . 
Netanyahu , who had taken a tough stance on the core issue of Israeli control over Jerusalem in a speech just before his White House meeting , said he appreciated that Clinton was &quot; taking tremendous pains &quot; to bring peace to the region . 
the White House said Clinton had some new ideas to offer at the meeting , which was hastily arranged after the Middle East peace process crumbled in the last few weeks . 
but officials cautioned against expecting any breakthrough . 
asked if he would be willing to convene Camp David-style talks between Israelis and Arabs to reinvigorate the peace process , Clinton replied : &quot; I think its important not to jump the gun on that . 
the first thing we have to do is to get the process going again . 
there is a pre-existing process , there are a whole lot of agreements , and the prime minister has some ideas about what we can do to get the substance working . 
but he noted that he had been heavily involved in promoting Middle East peace and added : &quot; I will continue to be heavily involved , and I wouldnt rule out any reasonable opportunity for me to make a positive contribution .
