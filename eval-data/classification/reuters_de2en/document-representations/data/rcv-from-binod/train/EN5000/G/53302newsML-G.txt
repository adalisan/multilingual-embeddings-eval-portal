despite signs that Iraq may be backing away from confrontation with the United States , Washington continued on Friday to build up a major Gulf force of attack jets and warships in the Gulf region . 
the United States has already sent eight F-117A stealth fighters with laser-guided bombs to Kuwait and four Vietnam-era B-52 heavy bombers armed with cruise missiles to the Indian Ocean Island of Diego Garcia . 
within days , the force is scheduled to include two aircraft carriers with a total of more than 150 Navy aircraft and over 20 other warships and submarines , many armed with cruise missiles . 
Turkey and Saudi Arabia have refused to let the United States use more than 140 U.S. attack planes based in their countries in any Iraq raid . 
the Pentagon has more than 40 F-16 and A-10 Air Force attack jets stationed in Kuwait and recently sent 18 more F-16s and 18 A-10s from Moody Air Force Base , Georgia , to Kuwait in a normal rotation deployment . 
all of those attack planes will remain in Kuwait for the present , officials said . 
&quot; We are posturing ourselves to be as flexible as possible , &quot; Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said earlier this week as Washington pondered its response to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein &apos;s challenge to allied air patrols over &quot; no fly &quot; zones in northern and southern Iraq . 
the aircraft carrier Enterprise is scheduled to pass through the Suez Canal from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea late on Saturday or Sunday and then move to the Gulf to join the carrier Carl Vinson on station there . 
analysts caution that U.S. jets could be shot down in a raid , but say Iraq radar defenses were diminished by the U.S. cruise missiles on September 4-5.and that radar-blasting &quot; harm &quot; missiles are a potent American weapon . 
the eight F-117As , designed to foil radar with their angular shapes and space-age metal skins , landed in Kuwait on Friday to spearhead any attack against Iraqi air defenses or perhaps a broader range of targets , including military command and control centers in Baghdad . 
the slow single-seat planes , officially designated &quot; fighters &quot; but which are really bombers , struck only at night with laser-guided bombs in 1,400 missions during the 1991 Gulf War to destroy Iraqi defenses and communications and open the skies for safer use by more vulnerable strike jets . 
&quot; The airplane is very quiet to fly , very maneuverable , &quot; said Air Force Major John Moring of Towson , Maryland , an F-117A pilot . 
although cruise missiles on warships and on the four B-52 bombers at a British base on Diego Garcia are designed to fly more than 500 miles 800 km and keep pilots from harms way , they do not have the concrete-penetrating warheads and destructive power of laser-guided bombs . 
&quot; You do expose pilots to missiles by using attack planes , &quot; said one senior Pentagon official , &quot; but you also put hardened Iraqi targets such as underground command and control centers at much higher risk . 
while the Iraqi air force has some advanced aircraft such as Soviet-built MiG-29 fighters , its pilots are considered no match for U.S. aviators . 
among aircraft on the Enterprise and Vinson are F-18 &quot; hornet &quot; multi-role fighters , F-14 &quot; Tomcat &quot; air superiority fighters , A-6E &quot; intruder &quot; attack jets , EA-6B &quot; Prowler &quot; electronic combat jets and E-2C &quot; Hawkeye &quot; airborne Warning and Control System aircraft . 
the Enterprise carries to the Gulf the latest version of the two-seat F-14s which have been modified to drop laser-guided bombs .
