for those who think living well is the best revenge , take heart . 
the 13th annual Moet luxury Index , the rate of inflation for the &quot; cost of living well , &quot; showed its first slowdown in five years . 
even as costs are rising , the 4.8 percent reading in the Index for 1996 was a steep drop from 1995 &apos;s 6.75 percent . 
just the thing to put the bubbles back in the bubbly . 
at the same time , the Consumer Price Index gained 3.3 percent in 1996 , up from a 2.8 percent rise the prior year -- the largest increase since 1989 . 
&quot; People are feeling more confident and , thus , are willing to spend more on affordable luxuries such as champagne and caviar , &quot; said Kevin J. Bannon , executive vice president of The Bank of New York . 
sponsored by Moet &amp; Chandon Champagne , the luxury Index had been as high as 9 percent in 1987 , and as low as 1.8 percent in both 1991 and 1992 . 
none of the 12 items on the index showed a price decrease . 
the largest price jump , 28.8 percent , was for a round trip ticket from New York to Paris on the Air France Concorde . 
the price in 1996 was $ 8,226 , up from $ 6,388 a year earlier . 
a woman &apos;s full-length mink coat from Alixandre furs rose 11.8 percent to $ 19,000 from $ 17,000 . 
but , while the best things in life might be free , the second-best things didn &apos;t get more expensive in 1996 .
