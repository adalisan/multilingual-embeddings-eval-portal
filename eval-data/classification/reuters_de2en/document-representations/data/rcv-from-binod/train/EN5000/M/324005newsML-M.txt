the Zimbabwe dollar was quoted softer against hard currencies at the end of Wednesday &apos;s interbank session on the back of slight import pressure coupled with central bank intervention . 
&quot; The Reserve Bank was buying in the morning and there was also a payment in the market . 
as a result the Zimbabwe dollar lost about one-and-a-half cents , &quot; one dealer said . 
the local unit finished the day at 10.8700 / 8850 against the U.S. dollar , down from 10.8550 / 8700 overnight and was also easier on the rand at 2.3138 / 3194 compared to 2.3100 / 3162 the previous day . 
it also lost ground on sterling to 18.4083 / 4446 from 18.3830 / 4195 , tracking a weaker U.S. dollar overseas , and closed at 6.9751 / 9870 versus the mark , down from 6.9655 / 9775 on Tuesday .
