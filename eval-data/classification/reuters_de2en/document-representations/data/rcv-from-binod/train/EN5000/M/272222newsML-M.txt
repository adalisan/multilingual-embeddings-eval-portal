Jordanian shares fell 0.23 percent on Sunday to their lowest level this month in quiet end-of-year trade , brokers said . 
the official Amman Financial Market 60-share index dropped for a third consecutive trading day to 151.97 points in business worth just 537,200 dinars ( $ 758,000 ) . 
it was the quietest trading day since sanction-hit Iraq announced last month it had reached agreement with the United Nations to resume limited oil exports , raising hopes in neighbouring Jordan of business opportunities and breathing new life into the Amman bourse . 
&quot; It &apos;s just a tired market today , &quot; said one broker . 
&quot; All the deals were book-keeping transactions before the new year . 
national Industries , expected to benefit from the oil-for-food deal , and heavyweight stock Arab Bank were the heaviest traded shares on Sunday . 
national Industries rose 0.04 dinars to 0.75 in turnover of 156,000 dinars . 
Arab Bank slipped 0.50 dinars to 251.00 dinars after shares worth 100,000 dinars changed hands . 
international Tobacco , expected to announce strong 1996 profit , rose 0.03 dinars to 1.31 dinars in turnover of around 20,000 dinars . 
but falling shares outnumbered gainers by 19 to 14 , with another 12 trading but closing unchanged . 
( $ 1 = 0.7080 dinar )
