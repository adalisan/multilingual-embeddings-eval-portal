British Prime Minister Tony Blair crowns an exhilarating first month in power on Thursday by welcoming to Downing Street one of the men who inspired his landslide election victory -- U.S. President Bill Clinton . 
the two leaders will take stock on a range of issues , but British officials said the visit was primarily an opportunity for &quot; Tony and Bill &quot; to cement an already warm relationship built on good personal chemistry and shared political ideas . 
indeed , the stopover , on Clinton &apos;s way home from a NATO-Russian summit in Paris and a Marshall Plan commemoration in the Hague , could slip into a mutual-admiration session . 
Clinton was the first foreign leader to congratulate Blair on his victory in the early hours of May 2 and the length of Thursday &apos;s visit has been extended twice at the president &apos;s request to give him more time to chat and socialise . 
aides said Blair was determined to use the keen interest that his Labour party &apos;s big win had aroused in the United States and elsewhere to raise Britain &apos;s standing in the world . 
&quot; He is well aware that the honeymoon will not last forever , but while it does he is determined to use it for Britain &apos;s advantage and to stamp Britain on the world map , &quot; one said . 
to underscore the importance of reviving the so-called special relationship between Washington and London , Blair has invited Clinton to address his weekly cabinet -- an honour previously given only to President Richard Nixon in 1969 . 
although Clinton praised defeated prime minister John Major , with whom he worked for five years , disputes over Bosnia and Northern Ireland cast a cloud over their relations at times . 
moreover , no one ever forgot that Major &apos;s Conservative party openly helped Clinton &apos;s Republican opponent , former president George Bush , in the 1992 race for the White House . 
now the stars are properly aligned . 
labour makes no secret of the lessons it learned from Clinton &apos;s campaigning -- particularly the need to rebut political attacks instantly and to focus laser-like on the crucial middle ground where elections are won and lost . 
the superficial similarities between Blair and Clinton tend to reinforce the political affinities . 
both are young and boyish . 
both are natural campaigning politicians . 
both attended Oxford University and their wives -- who will lunch together on Thursday -- have brought up children while maintaining careers as high-flying lawyers . 
but as several British commentators have noted , there is also a big difference . 
Blair , with a parliamentary majority of 179 , can ram through whatever laws he likes . 
Clinton , a Democrat , must constantly battle the Republican-led Congress . 
&quot; Mr Clinton may lead the most powerful nation on earth , but Mr Blair , for now , leads a government with far more power at home than Mr Clinton , or any American president , will ever enjoy , &quot; The Economist wrote recently . 
subjects for Thursday &apos;s talks include ideas for job creation , NATO , Bosnia , Hong Kong and Northern Ireland . 
Blair &apos;s aides said he would encourage Clinton to keep pressing for an Irish Republican Army ceasefire so the guerrillas &apos; political wing , Sinn Fein , can gain a seat at talks on the future of Northern Ireland . 
after a joint news conference with Blair in the garden at 10 Downing Street , Clinton is due to go sightseeing before flying back to Washington in the evening .
