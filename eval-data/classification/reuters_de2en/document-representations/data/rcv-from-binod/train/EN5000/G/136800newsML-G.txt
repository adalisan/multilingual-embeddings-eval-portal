a shipping tycoon hoping to lead Hong Kong when Britain hands back the colony to communist China next year said on Wednesday that Chinese investment in his company posed no potential conflict of interest . 
billionaire Tung Chee-hwa joins a former Appeal Court judge , the outgoing chief justice and another businessman aiming to step into Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten &apos;s shoes when the British withdraw at midnight on June 30 , just 251 days away . 
the territory &apos;s first post-colonial leader will be selected by a 400-strong selection board chosen by a Chinese-appointed Preparatory Committee . 
Tung , submitting to unfamiliar media scrutiny at his first news conference since declaring his candidacy on Friday , acknowleged Chinese funds had helped bail out the family empire in the mid-1980s . 
&quot; Mr Fok led a consortium investing in my company . 
I know there was Chinese funds in the consortium , &quot; Tung said . 
&quot; Mr Fok had a very good vision . 
he felt it was a great moment to invest ... His investment return was very high because the economy and the shipping business had picked up afterward . 
Tung stepped down from the helm of OOIL , now restored to economic health , last Friday . 
Tung said he would keep a minority stake in the company and said the majority stake , held in a family trust , would be controlled by his younger brother , Tung Chee-chen . 
Tung said he saw no conflict of interest emerging from his business past and said Hong Kong &apos;s free press and its legislature would ensure transparent government . 
if he won the top job in bustling Hong Kong he said he would retire and not return to business after completing his five-year term as chief executive . 
Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control under a 1984 Sino-British declaration which pledges considerable autonomy for the territory and the right to maintain capitalist freedoms for 50 years . 
the latest candidate to enter the race , former Appeal Court Judge Simon Li , played on his home-grown roots at a glitzy , celebrity-laced campaign launch on Wednesday . 
Soon-to-retire Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang and businessman Peter woo , son-in-law of late shipping magnate Sir Y.K. 
Pao , are also in the running . 
both Tung and Li avoided questions concerning the future of civil liberties , Chinese dissidents and democracy when Hong Kong becomes a part of China . 
they both said it depended on interpretation of the Chinese- drafted Basic Law , or mini constitution , of Hong Kong to come into force next year .
