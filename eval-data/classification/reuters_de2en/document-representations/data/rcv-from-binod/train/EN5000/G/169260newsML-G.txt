Moscow said on Wednesday it hoped President Bill Clinton &apos;s re-election , the same day as President Boris Yeltsin came through a heart operation , would help keep U.S.-Russian relations on track . 
but independent foreign policy experts said the two former Cold War foes face a testing period in which difficult problems , swept under the carpet as both presidents sought re-election this year , will finally have to be tackled . 
Moscow released no official statement on the U.S. election but Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov made brief comments to reporters on Clinton &apos;s victory over Republican Bob Dole . 
&quot; The Russian government already has experience of working with the current president of the United States and Russia also hopes for the long-term development of fruitful cooperation between the two states in the future , &quot; Interfax news agency quoted him as saying . 
Primakov later told Itar-Tass news agency : &quot; We have many years of ties with Bill Clinton . 
he is predictable and this plays a big role in bilateral relations . 
Kremlin sources said Yeltsin had been informed in his hospital bed that Clinton had been re-elected and that he planned to send a congratulatory telegram . 
Yeltsin , who likes to refer to Clinton as &quot; my friend Bill &quot; , enjoys a cordial relationship with the U.S. president . 
Clinton also sent a get-well message to Yeltsin on Tuesday . 
&quot; The fact that Moscow and Washington &apos;s policies are defined by seasoned politicians -- President Boris Yeltsin and President Bill Clinton -- who have warm personal ties creates the hope that problems will be solved in a spirit of partnership , &quot; a senior Russian diplomat , who was not named , told Interfax . 
the Kremlin did not express any official preference before the election . 
but its desire for continuity and mistrust of the Republicans ensured a slant towards Clinton behind the scenes . 
Clinton has been a firm backer of Russian reforms and has stood behind Yeltsin , despite being under pressure at home for tougher opposition to Moscow &apos;s military campaign to crush separatists in rebel Chechnya . 
Clinton and Yeltsin have often opted to agree to differ on important issues to keep relations on track and to prevent rows which might have marred their election hopes . 
the main problem is NATO &apos;s plans to enlarge by taking in new members from eastern and central Europe . 
Moscow says this would threaten its security and bitterly opposes it . 
but Clinton said last month he was committed to trying to bring some former communist states into NATO by 1999 . 
problems also remain over terms of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) treaty and Washington &apos;s fears that the Kremlin will pursue a more nationalist policy to appease its domestic opponents . 
Moscow appears to believe tackling these problems will be easier with Clinton than with Dole , who Russians feel might have been more likely to make unpredictable policy changes . 
&quot; Clinton &apos;s victory is a relief for Russia . 
a difficult period lies ahead and it hopes for continuity from a pair who have good personal ties , &quot; political analyst Irina Kobrinskaya said . 
&quot; The honeymoon period ( after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 ) is over but Russia saw no gain from a change . 
Andrei Piontkowski of the Centre for Strategic Studies think-tank agreed . 
&quot; Moscow clearly preferred Clinton . 
natural problems have arisen and Russia thought these two presidents , who know each other , would be the best ones to tackle them . 
Viktor Borisyuk , a former member of Yeltsin &apos;s team of analysts , said it was natural that Washington and Moscow would drift apart but saw no risk of Cold War confrontation . 
&quot; Clinton &apos;s re-election means an old friend is back for Russia . 
there are plenty of problems to talk about but I don &apos;t think we need to panic like this was the Cold War , &quot; he said .
