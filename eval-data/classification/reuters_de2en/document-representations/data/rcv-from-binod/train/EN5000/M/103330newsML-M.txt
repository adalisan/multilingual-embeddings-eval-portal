selling pressure in the Indian global depositary receipt ( GDR ) market continued on Tuesday , albeit at a slower pace , but , with Bombay hanging by a thread , traders expect renewed falls . 
&quot; The undertone is very weak , the year low will be tested sooner rather than later , &quot; a broker said . 
the HSBC James Capel Indian GDR index JCEAI closed down 0.11 points at 58.59 points , with the premium over the local market at 9.35 percent after the Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index rose 24.49 points to 3,027.35 . 
some analysts believe that the BSE-30 share index could go as low as 2,400 before it rebounds and the Indian GDRs are already down more than a quarter since the start of the year . 
political worries over the future of India &apos;s coalition government and slowing industrial growth have combined to hit the share index . 
&quot; This market will only turn when there is the perception of compelling value combined with liquidity and confidence in the local investors . 
among individual stocks , State Bank of India is now below its offer price of last week at $ 13.75 / $ 14.25 after being issued at $ 14.25 . 
there will be plenty of opportunity to get in later , &quot; said a trader . 
elsewhere , the Capel Korea GDR Index ended up 0.30 points at 69.23 , a premium of 27.34 percent over the local market , after the Korea composite Index rose 2.29 points to 797.62 . 
the Capel Taiwan GDR Index ended down 0.28 points , at 90.77 , a premium of 2.29 percent after the Taiwan weighted Index fell 35.51 points or 0.54 percent to 6,584.91 .
