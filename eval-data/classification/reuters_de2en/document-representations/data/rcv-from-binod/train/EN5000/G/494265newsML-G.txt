the European Commission on Tuesday adopted changes adjusting the veal early marketing premia to meet French demands , a spokesman said . 
&quot; The changes proposed on March 21 were adopted by written procedure , &quot; the spokesman said . 
France made a strong protest at last month &apos;s farm council that the levels of the early marketing premia aimed at reducing the amount of beef on the market because of mad cow disease were giving Dutch producers an advantage . 
this was because Dutch veal calves were heavier than those raised in France , officials said . 
the revised premia were given as : from April 14 to June 1997 : 
weight new premium old premium 
up to 110kg 0 ecus 70 ecus 
from 110 to 120kg 65 ecus 65 ecus 
above 120 kg 50 ecus 60 ecus
