Paraguay &apos;s President Juan Carlos Wasmosy accused the chairman of his own Colorado Party of plotting to overthrow him , in a formal charge lodged with the State Prosecutor on Wednesday . 
Wasmosy , the landlocked South American republic &apos;s first democratically-elected leader in half a century , accused party chairman Luis Argana of comments &quot; trying to promote a popular uprising against the legally constituted order . 
Argana belongs to a rival faction of the party that has ruled Paraguay for 50 years -- 35 of them under dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner , who was ousted in a coup in 1989 . 
Argana has been party chairman since April 1996 and will compete in party primaries next month to choose the Colorado candidate for presidential elections in May 1998 . 
since half Paraguay &apos;s voters are Colorado Party members , it is likely that whoever wins the primaries will become president . 
Members of Argana &apos;s faction of the ruling party said this Monday that they would try to force Wasmosy &apos;s departure in September after the party primaries . 
&quot; If the best thing for the party &apos;s election chances is for President Wasmosy to resign , we should consider that option , &quot; said dissident Colorado deputy Bernardino Cano Radil . 
Wasmosy said such language &quot; constitutes preparatory action meant to create a supposed power vaccuum to induce the people to rise up in rebellion . 
but Argana said tough talk against Wasmosy was &quot; simply a reaction to offensive speeches by the government and Wasmosy .
