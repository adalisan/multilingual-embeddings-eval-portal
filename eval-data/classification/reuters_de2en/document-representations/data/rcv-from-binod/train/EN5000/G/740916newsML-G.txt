Italian mountain lion Marco Pantani returned triumphantly to Alpe d &apos;Huez after injury as German Jan Ullrich showed similar kingly qualities in consolidating his overall Tour de France lead on Saturday . 
Pantani , having recovered from a serious road injury that kept him out of cycling for 16 months , won the 13th stage at the same Alpine finish of one of his two stage victories in 1995 . 
the 27-year-old Italian , third overall in 1994 , rode impressively up the long ascent to the 1,860-metre high Alpe d &apos;Huez , dropping rivals until only Ullrich remained less than a minute behind . 
he came in 47 seconds ahead of yellow jersey holder Ullrich to leap two places to third overall eight minutes 24 seconds behind the German leader . 
Ullrich , remarkably strong in managing to stay with the astonishingly hot pace set by the Italian , increased his lead over French mountain specialist Richard Virenque , who was third one minute 27 seconds behind Pantani , to 6 : 22 . 
Pantani said it was a more pleasing victory than two years ago because of the serious injury in October 1995 when he collided with an oncoming jeep during the Milan-Turin race and shattered his left Shin . 
&quot; So much has changed since then , but what was the same was the Pantani that crossed the line first , &quot; he said . 
he said the 1995 stage victory was harder because there were other tough climbs before the ascent to Alpe d &apos;Huez , whereas on Saturday the riders reached the foot of the mountain fresher . 
Pantani said the Mercatone Uno team &apos;s plan that he should attack at the start of the climb had worked . 
&quot; But we could not be sure how it would work out , &quot; he said . 
Ullrich said : &quot; I &apos;m very happy not to have lost much time . 
on the contrary , I gained time on all my principal rivals . 
Virenque said : &quot; Pantani set a pace that was too hard . 
I had to keep going at my pace and not force it . 
it was a good operation on the whole . 
defending champion Bjarne Riis , who fell well behind 10 kms from the finish and came in 2 : 28 adrift , and Spain &apos;s Abraham Olano , a disappointing 12th in the stage 3 : 25 behind , dropped one place each to fourth and fifth respectively . 
Briton Chris Boardman , who wore the yellow jersey for one day after winning the prologue , pulled out of the race after some 50 kms , suffering from injuries sustained in earlier stages . 
the riders face another tough 148-km mountain stage to Courchevel on Sunday with three climbs to arund 2,000 metres including the uphill finish .
