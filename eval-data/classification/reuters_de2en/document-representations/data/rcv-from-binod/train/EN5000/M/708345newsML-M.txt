a strong morning spurt in the final session of a week of record highs on the New Zealand stock exchange provoked a new scramble for shares in Telecom and squeezed the Top 40 index up to another record close . 
brokers said the pattern of trade , a solid early climb followed by a midday trough then a run-up at the end , left Telecom in central focus with some positions still short . 
&quot; I think there &apos;s probably a bit of pain being endured out there in Telecom , &quot; one senior dealer said . 
although the market retreated from an intraday high of 2,538 points , the index closed up nearly seven points at 2,526.65 . 
volume of NZ $ 67.9 million was deceptive in that it did not reflect broad-based activity , dealers said . 
telecom , which has a substantial weighting in the Top 40 index , closed up 8.0 cents at $ 7.80 , for another year high , having accelerated to a peak of $ 7.90 during the session . 
David Price of First NZ Capital said of the Telecom squeeze , &quot; I think what you &apos;re seeing is overseas investment into a market where there is no domestic supply . 
&quot; Most institituions are either underweight or at market ( weighting ) , and they &apos;re loath to sell any more . 
&quot; He noted that the early index rise would have raised the buying pressure .
