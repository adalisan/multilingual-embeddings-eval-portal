Canadian officials declined late on Monday to confirm that Canada had formally offered to lead a multinational peacekeeping force in eastern Zaire . 
officials at the office of Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien , the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of National Defence said no definitive decision had been made on whether Canada would have a significant role in a proposed United Nations force seeking to end the crisis in Zaire . 
in New York , diplomatic sources at the United Nations said Canada &apos;s U.N. ambassador , Robert Fowler , had made a proposal in an informal meeting for Canada to lead an international force into eastern Zaire . 
John Bell , a spokesman for Canada &apos;s Department of Foreign Affairs , said Chretien had not made a decision on the deployment of Canadian peacekeepers in Zaire . 
bell said Chretien conferred by telephone with 15 world leaders during the weekend and urged them to support a U.N.-led peacekeeping force in Zaire . 
&quot; Prime Minister Chretien decided that the urgency of the situation required some action , &quot; Bell said . 
a spokeswoman for Chretien &apos;s office said the prime minister was concerned an international effort to end the bloodshed and help refugees in Zaire was not moving fast enough . 
but an official at Canada &apos;s Department of National Defence said reports that Canada had decided to participate in a U.N. force in Zaire was &quot; mere speculation . 
&quot; There has been some contingency planning , but nothing has been decided , &quot; said Captain Darryl Dubuc .
