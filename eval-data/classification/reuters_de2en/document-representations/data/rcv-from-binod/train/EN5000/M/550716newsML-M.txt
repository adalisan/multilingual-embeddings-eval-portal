emerging market debts were unchanged to slightly higher , consolidating the gains of Tuesday &apos;s rally , traders said . 
the bellwether Argentina FRB and Brazil C bonds were barely changed , as dealers took advantage of the higher prices to lighten their long positions , they said . 
Booksquaring before the May Day holiday in many Latin American countries and Russia also kept trading light , they added . 
the focus of the market was on Brazil , which was poised to benefit from expected sale of the mammoth mining conglomerate , Companhia do Vale do Rio Doce ( CVRD ) , traders said . 
the visibility of CVRD sale was important to show the progress of Brazil &apos;s privatization drive and opened the way for future sale of telecomomunication companies , they said . 
the sale was delayed because the supreme court in Brazil has yet to rule on a government petition that various injunctions against the sale be considered by a single court . 
but the delay did not rattle the Brazil &apos;s debt papers as the auction was still widely expected to take place soon , said Marcelo Fleury , head of the Brazil Desk at Garban Corp. 
the fact that risk premium of Brazil debt papers held steady despite the delay indicated that the market expected the review of the injunction to be positive , he said . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of noise , &quot; Fleury said . 
Brazil finance Minister Pedro Malan said in New York that he remained confident that the auction would proceed , but did not specify the time frame . 
overshadowed by the CVRD auction was the latest better-than-expected trade figure for Brazil . 
Brazil posted a $ 144 million trade deficit in the fourth week of April , bringing the deficit for the month so far to $ 621 million . 
for the first three months of 1997 , the trade gap reached over $ 3 billion . 
Fleury said while the improvement was encouraging , it was also influenced by seasonal factors . 
good harvest of soybeans and other agricultural commodities was likely to help narrowing the gap for the next two months or so , he said . 
Argentina debt papers were little after Standard and Poor &apos;s reviewed and adjusted a raft of Argentine domestic credit ratings , which resulted in affirmations of three-quartes of the existing ratings , three upgrades , 10 downgrades and other adjustments . 
spreads of Argentine corporate and sovereign papers contracted sharply last week after S &amp; P surprised the market to upgrade of a dozen companies , some of which to investment grades , due to a change of rating methodology . 
trading sources said it was unclear if the spreads of Argentine papers would narrow further . 
&quot; What happened last week was a technical rally , &quot; said a eurobond trader , adding that dealers were wary of &quot; over-extending &quot; themselves . 
Position-squaring lifted Russian Minfin bonds and dollar Vnesh loan papers . 
Russia Vnesh rose 1 / 4 to 80-3 / 4 bid .
