NATO and Russia failed on Tuesday to reach a new deal on an all-embracing post-Cold War partnership , but said &quot; some progress &quot; had been made . 
a joint communique said the two sides , represented by alliance Secretary-General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign Secretary Yevgeny Primakov , had also agreed to &quot; intensify negotiations in order to reach agreement at the earliest possible date &quot; . 
after the talks Primakov said the next round would be held in Moscow , but declined to give a date . 
&quot; Obviously the talks are not easy , but you understand that the subject is not easy , &quot; Primakov told newsmen . 
NATO sources said the talks took place in an atmosphere of goodwill and said follow-up talks were still aimed at reaching an agreement which could be signed at a NATO-Russia summit in Paris on May 27 -- a date originally proposed by Moscow . 
the statement did not give details of areas where progress had been made . 
the Western allies are keen that a NATO-Russia &quot; charter &quot; should be the centrepiece of a new European security order for the 21st century that would alleviate Russian fears over NATO &apos;s planned eastwards enlargement . 
Russia has been demanding strict curbs on any military activities in any new member states likely to be admitted to the alliance from former communist Europe . 
Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic are the favourites to be admitted at an enlargement summit in Madrid next July . 
NATO says such demands are out of the question because such issues are a matter of national sovereignty . 
before starting the talks Primakov said he hoped the meeting would be successful in removing the remaining obstacles to a historic pact . 
shortly before the meeting ended , Yeltsin appeared to be preparing Russian public opinion for a climbdown on the enlargement issue which Moscow has strongly opposed . 
&quot; We will do everything to minimise the consequences of possible NATO enlargement for Russia &apos;s security , &quot; Itar-Tass news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying in an interview to be published on Wednesday by the defence ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvevda . 
Yeltsin , tacitly accepting that Moscow could not stop enlargement , said he would press on with efforts to deepen integration between Russia and other former Soviet republics and to develop ties with China . 
Russia has demanded that new members should not be permitted to overhaul existing military establishments such as airfields to bring them in line with NATO standards .
