NYCE cotton settled slightly weaker as the U.S. Department of Agriculture &apos;s long-awaited planted area estimate failed to inspire a more substantial price move , dealers said . 
the USDA said growers would plant 14.0 million acres of cotton in 1997 , compared with an estimate of 14.485 million acres in March . 
analysts had pegged today &apos;s forecast at 13.83-14.30 million acres . 
market sources said last week &apos;s rally to a 15-week high of 77.65 cents in December reflected expecations for a reduction from the previous estimate , to around 14.0 million acres . 
&quot; The report was not enough for the funds to start running , &quot; Sharon Johnson , an analyst with Frank Schneider and Co , Inc , said . 
&quot; They may be more inclined to do that when they see how long they are tomorrow . 
Johnson said a net speculative long position closer to 25 percent than 15 percent , could prompt liquidation and send December towards its downside target of 76.10 cents . 
the benchmark contract closed down 0.28 cent at 77.12 cents per lb , having ranged from 77.39 to 76.75 cents . 
the rest of the board settled 0.18 lower to 0.05 cent firmer . 
resistance in December remained at 77.70-77.95 cents . 
an estimated 7,500 lots changed hands on the day , compared with Friday &apos;s official 11,063 lots . 
NYCE will be closed Friday for the Fourth of July holiday , and will reopen on Monday , July 7 .
