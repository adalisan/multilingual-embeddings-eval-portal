France &apos;s 1998 government spending will rise markedly less quickly than gross domestic product growth , a finance ministry source said on Tuesday . 
the source also reaffirmed the government &apos;s commitment to cut the deficit to GDP ratio to three percent next year in preparation for European monetary union . 
&quot; Government spending will rise very significantly less than gross domestic product , &quot; the source said . 
the source said the budget was being prepared in the context of stronger economic growth but that the government would strictly control public spending . 
&quot; This result will be obtained through savings which will allow us to reach the target of three percent for all departments without increasing state levies . 
this is coherent with the government &apos;s will to take care of its debt problem , &quot; the source added . 
Ministry by ministry spending limits for 1998 were finalised by Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Friday in the first leg of a crucial budget excercise . 
the government now has to tackle the revenue side of the finance act before it is presented to cabinet on September 24 .
