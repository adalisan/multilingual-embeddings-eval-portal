German shares played catch-up to overnight Wall Street gains in early dealings on Wednesday as the market sought strength and higher trading volumes to break 3,800 points in the blue-chip DAX index . 
traders said any break above 3,800 points would require much stronger interest in the market since recent gains have come mainly from top DAX index shares such as Deutsche Bank AG and Siemens AG . 
a lot more stocks must participate in any rally if we want to break 3,800 points , &quot; said one dealer . 
many dealers were also squaring their books ahead of the close of the second quarter , which should help to underpin the DAX index in the near-term . 
&quot; There &apos;s no reason for the market to show any signs of weakness , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; The upward trend is still intact . 
among specific shares , carmaker Volkswagen AG was up six marks at 1,239 marks after reaching a deal with IG Metall over wages and early-retirement guidelines for older workers . 
technical factors dominated other major DAX components , including Deutsche Bank AG , which was up 4.60 marks at 104.10 marks following a four percent gain on Tuesday . 
some traders said Deutsche shares have a near-term potential of reaching 106 marks but noted that other major bank shares were not participating as heavily in the sector gains . 
electronics group Siemens AG was up 55 pfennigs at 106.90 marks after a small bout of initial profit-taking after rising about three percent in bourse trade on Tuesday . 
&quot; It &apos;s not too bad that Siemens is taking a breather , &quot; said one Frankfurt trader . 
but other traders said Siemens still has a near-term target of 110 marks based on technical chart factors and said the modest pullback was no sign of an end to the gains .
