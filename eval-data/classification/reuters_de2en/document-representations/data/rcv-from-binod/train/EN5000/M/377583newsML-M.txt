ten-year bond futures settled lower as U.S. treasuries beat a retreat on strong retail sales and jobs data that appeared to lend credence to arguments for a rise in American interest rates . 
domestic support failed to materialise as the 10-year contract finished 28 basis points lower at 130.78 after having fluctuated between 130.84 and 130.60 . 
&quot; The problem is we expected domestic investors to come in as the market weakened and they didn &apos;t show . 
we &apos;re seeing fund managers instead convering their long positions and the market seems pretty pessimistic , &quot; said one trader . 
analysts said they believed even a good U.S. producer price number on Friday would not be enough to lure back buyers who are worried that the Federal Reserve may boost U.S. rates at its next meeting on March 25 . 
&quot; In the United States , it &apos;s not inflation which is a worry but rather the indebtedness of households and the strength of retail sales in January and February that could worry the Fed , &quot; said one trader . 
traders saw the weakness continuing Friday with one saying the 10-year bond future could test strong support at 130.50 . 
another cited 130.40 / 36 as support with the next stop 129.70 . 
traders said the market was also affected by position covering linked to Portugal &apos;s issue this morning of a 3.0 billion franc 10-year bond priced at 17 basis points over the comparable 10-year government bond and the Ecu OAT auction . 
traders said the 17 point spread on the Portuguese issue had drawn interest in a market in which demand was otherwise limited . 
traders added that worries about a possible delay to a single currency were also weighing on the bond future . 
&quot; In Europe , there are so many rumours going about on a delay in monetary union , &quot; said one analyst . 
&quot; The decision will be a political one , not an economic one , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s ridiculous to think Germany is going to miss monetary union for a 0.2 or 0.3 percentage point ( shortfall ) on its deficit target when it has 50 years of stability behind it . 
PIBOR gained one basis point to 96.55 on the back of a franc that firmed to 3.3726 per mark from 3.3743 .
