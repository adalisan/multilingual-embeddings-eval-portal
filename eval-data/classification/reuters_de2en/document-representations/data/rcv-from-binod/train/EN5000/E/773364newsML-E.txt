the Caribbean Basin Initiative may be included in fast-track trade legislation this fall , House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Friday . 
Gingrich said he favors the Caribbean trade plan designed to give those countries similar provisions as the North American Free Trade Agreement . 
the White House had wanted the Caribbean Basin Initiative added to the tax bill that passed Congress Thursday , but would not agree to Republican reform proposals for Amtrak as a trade-off so it was not included .
