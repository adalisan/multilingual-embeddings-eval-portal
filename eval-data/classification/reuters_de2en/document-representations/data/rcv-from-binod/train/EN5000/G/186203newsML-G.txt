activists opposing Japan &apos;s claim to a group of East China Sea islands ended a three-day meeting on Wednesday calling for the formation of a worldwide Chinese alliance to further their cause . 
&quot; We appeal to all the Chinese in the whole world to prepare for the establishment of a worldwide Chinese alliance for the protection of the Diaoyu islands , &quot; Lo Sio , organiser of the meeting in Portuguese-administered Macau , told reporters . 
the 13 activists from Hong Kong , Macau , Taiwan , Canada , Australia and Japan earlier announced they would be take out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times to urge the international community to block Japan &apos;s bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations security council . 
the islands are claimed as the Diaoyus by arch rivals China and Taiwan and as the Senkakus by Japan . 
the dispute erupted in July when a rightist Japanese youth group erected a makeshift lighthouse pressing Japan &apos;s claim . 
protest flotillas set sail from Taiwan and Hong Kong to the uninhabited islands . 
in September , a leading Hong Kong activist drowned when he leapt into the sea . 
in Hong Kong on Wednesday , a group of activists scuffled with police when they tried to deliver a protest letter to the Japanese consulate in the busy Central district . 
they were allowed into the building after they showed their identity cards to the police , but journalists were prevented from following . 
the consulate had approached police to step up security after a group of demonstrators , led by some Hong Kong legislators , stormed on to the grounds in October . 
Japan claims sovereign rights to the islands and refuses to acknowledge that the dispute is still open for discussion with China . 
Tokyo &apos;s claim dates to 1895 , when Japan defeated China and seized Taiwan and other territories . 
China has claimed sovereignty over the islands for centuries .
