Seoul stocks are forecast to decline on Friday with blue chips pressured because of fizzling hopes about the economy &apos;s recovery , brokers said . 
they said the economic optimism , sparked most recently by an improvement in the June trade balance , was losing ground in the absence of additional good news . 
the troubled Jinro Group &apos;s affiliates are expected to remain firmer on the group &apos;s plan to generate some 840 billion won by selling most of its affiliates and some real estate . 
the composite index fell 4.22 points to 767.77 on Thursday . 
three listed Jinro Group affiliates went limit-up on Thursday after the group announced the sales plan . 
the group was selected for bailout in April by its creditor banks . 
&quot; Investors are becoming increasingly doubtful that the economy has passed the hard times , &quot; said Chang Kun-woo of Daishin Securities . 
relatively tight liquidity on the money market is also discouraging investors , brokers said . 
&quot; It &apos;s unusual that liquidity has continued to be tight during the early part of a month , &quot; said Kim Chun-kon of Daewoo Securities .
