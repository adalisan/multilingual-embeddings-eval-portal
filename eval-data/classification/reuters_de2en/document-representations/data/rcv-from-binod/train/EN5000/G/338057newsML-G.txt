the press freedom watchdog group Reporters Sans Frontieres ( RSF ) protested to Iran on Tuesday about the arrest of Faraj Sarkouhi , editor-in-chief of the monthly Adineh , who it said was being held in secret in Tehran . 
&quot; RSF is deeply concerned about Faraj Sarkouhi &apos;s safety , &quot; the Paris-based group said in a letter to the Iranian embassy in the French capital . 
&quot; Our organisation asks you to use your influence to have Faraj Sarkouhi released and to ensure that the journalist can contact his family as soon as possible . 
RSF said Sarkouhi was arrested on Monday after a string of incidents including his failure to arrive in Berlin in November for a visit which Iranian authorities insisted took place but which Germany denied occurred . 
Sarkouhi later addressed a news conference at Tehran airport which RSF said was &quot; carefully rehearsed &quot; and at which he said he had gone from Germany to Turkmenistan but was unable to show his passport to prove he had been in Europe .
