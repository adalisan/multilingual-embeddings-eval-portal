former soldier Timothy McVeigh was sentenced to death Friday for the Oklahoma City bombing , a devastating attack that killed 168 people and thrust indiscriminate political terror into the heart of America . 
the jury deliberated for 11 hours before deciding that the decorated Gulf War veteran , whose patriotism turned to raging anti-government hatred , should be executed for the April 19 , 1995 bombing of a federal building . 
the jury rejected a defence plea that McVeigh , 29 , should be spared and serve life in prison . 
as the judge read his sentence , McVeigh sat still , hands folded under his chin , and betrayed no emotion . 
he has been stoic and expressionless throughout the seven-week trial . 
afterwards , he looked toward his father , mother and sister and mouthed the words &quot; It &apos;s alright . 
&quot; Leaving the courtroom , he waved briefly to the jury and nodded to the judge . 
McVeigh &apos;s mother and sister were in tears , while many relatives of bomb victims appeared numb . 
the jury of seven men and five women found McVeigh guilty on June 2 of the attack on Oklahoma City &apos;s Alfred P. Murrah building , in which more than 500 people were also injured . 
the dead included 19 pre-school children . 
during the penalty phase , dozens of disfigured survivors , weeping mothers mourning dead babies and rescuers ravaged by relentless nightmares told how the bomb damaged their lives . 
after the sentence , victims &apos; relatives voiced a mixture of sadness and relief . 
&quot; He was an animal when he did it and he doesn &apos;t deserve to live , &quot; said Charles Tomlin , whose son was killed . 
Jannie Coverdale , whose two grandsons died , said : &quot; It &apos;s not out of revenge . 
we felt it was necessary for Tim McVeigh to get the death penalty . 
following the decision , the judge praised the jurors . 
saying they might wonder one day if they did the right thing , Matsch said : &quot; The answer is yes , because you did it . 
that &apos;s what we rely upon ... You are the final authority . 
lead prosecutor Joe Hartzler said the sentence was &quot; not a moment of joy . 
&quot; Justice prevailed , but we &apos;re saddened by the tragic event that brought us here in the first place , &quot; he said . 
McVeigh &apos;s lead attorney Stephen Jones said : &quot; The verdict is entitled to respect and all Americans should accord it that respect until such time , if ever , it is overturned . 
we ask that the barriers of intolerance which have divided us may crumble , suspicions disappear and the hatred cease . 
prosecutors said McVeigh was a domestic terrorist who hoped to ignite an anti-government insurrection . 
angered by the death of 80 people in the 1993 federal siege of a Branch Davidian cult compound in Waco , Texas , he bombed the Oklahoma City building exactly two years later , they said . 
the bombing was not only the biggest mass murder in U.S. history but shattered the myth that middle America was safe from the random political violence stalking other nations . 
&quot; We never knew such a dark and horrible place existed in America until Timothy McVeigh sent us there , &quot; said prosecutor Beth Wilkinson , calling him a traitor who thought he could &quot; declare war on his fellow Americans . 
defence attorney Jones finally did not dispute McVeigh &apos;s guilt but told the jury : &quot; He is not a demon , though surely his act was demonic . 
the defence never took issue with the prosecution portrayal of McVeigh &apos;s politics but tried to explain his anger over Waco , a rallying cry for the extreme right wing , who believe the government abused its power there . 
&quot; Millions of Americans share Mr. McVeigh &apos;s views ... Mr. McVeigh acted on them , &quot; said Jones . 
he also warned the jury in his closing argument that if executed , McVeigh could never reveal whether others were involved . 
accused co-conspirator Terry Nichols will be tried later . 
as he excused the jurors , the judge said they were free to discuss the case but he asked them not to talk about Nichols . 
during the penalty phase of the trial , the jurors watched dozens of Oklahoma City residents fight back tears as they described their loss . 
the jury saw videotapes of three young children who were permanently injured by the blast . 
Mike Lenz , whose pregnant wife was killed , said after the blast he put a gun in his mouth but could not pull the trigger . 
the explosion brought nine stories of concrete and steel crashing down , trapping and crushing babies in a daycare centre , office workers , federal employees and many people who came to seek veteran and Social Security benefits . 
nothing during the trial indicated any remorse by McVeigh , who did not testify in his own defence . 
McVeigh becomes the 14th prisoner on federal Death Row . 
another 3,200 prisoners await execution on state charges .
