exceptional gains from equity disposals are expected to give a strong boost to conglomerate CITIC Pacific Ltd &apos;s 1996 interim net profit , analysts said . 
the company recorded interim net earnings of HK $ 1.41 billion in the first half in 1995 , with no exceptionals booked . 
&quot; Its first-half net profit this year will be boosted mainly by exceptional gains , &quot; said Dennis Leung , analyst at Dharmala Securities . 
those gains come from the sale of part of its stakes in Hong Kong Telecommunications Co Ltd and Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd ( Dragonair ) . 
CITIC Pacific , the Hong Kong-listed arm of China &apos;s state-trading giant China International Trust and Investment Corp ( CITIC ) , is a diversified group with interests ranging from trading and distribution , warehousing , property investment and development , power generation and infrastructure and investment holdings to telecommunications and aviation . 
in January , CITIC Pacific said it was reducing its stake in Hongkong Telecom to 10 percent from 12 percent by placing out 208.82 million shares . 
in April , the conglomerate stated it was selling a 17.66 percent stake in Dragonair , reducing its shareholding to 28.50 percent . 
it did not say how much the sale raised . 
in June , it said it was selling another two percent of Hongkong Telecom , slashing its interest to eight percent to raise another HK $ 3.0 billion . 
analysts said it was not clear if that deal would have been booked in the first-half results . 
&quot; The net earnings growth should be good because of the exceptional gains from disposals of shares in Hongkong Telecom and Dragonair , &quot; said an analyst from Schroders . 
Carl Wong , associate director at James Capel , said he expected an interim net of HK $ 4.735 billion , which would include HK $ 3.028 billion in exceptional gains . 
that would include the contribution from its remaining stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd which also netted an exceptional gain from its own sale of Dragonair shares , he said . 
Leung of Dharmala said he expected to see an interim net profit of HK $ 4.2 billion , with operating profit rising about 19 percent to HK $ 680 million . 
&quot; Its infrastructure projects and power stations made more of a contribution in the first half , &quot; Leung said . 
but he noted that motor sales by its wholly-owned Dah Chong Hong dealership had declined . 
CITIC Pacific &apos;s associates , including Hongkong Telecom and Dragonair , generated an income of about HK $ 1.2 billion for the group in the first half , Leung said .
