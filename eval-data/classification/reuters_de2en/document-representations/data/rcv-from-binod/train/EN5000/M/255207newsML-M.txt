foreign crude business into the U.S. was subdued Friday , with domestic players waiting to see where North Sea barrels set for December import land . 
one of the pair of VLCC &apos;s fixed for December 21 and 25 loading dates was confirmed sold for delivery to the U.S. Gulf . 
other barrels coming over have yet to find homes . 
&quot; We &apos;ll get more information on those barrels next week , &quot; said a trader . 
widening arbitrage for trans-Atlantic barrels attracted some interest from at least one Wall Street house , and other players . 
the spread , on the screen , between January West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent was around $ 1.10- $ 1.15 a barrel for most of Friday . 
the strong rally on the IPE failed to stop a drift lower in North Sea crude premiums . 
dated Brent was offered as low as 15 cents below January Brent paper , down from even and + 20 cents the previous two sessions . 
Mediterranean grades were off as well , making themselves cheaper on the completion of five crude contracts contracts this week under the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal . 
coastal Corp was believed to be a holder of one of the five contracts okayed by the United Nations this week . 
the firm was expected to take 60,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) to its refinery on the Caribbean island of Aruba , sources have said . 
in the U.S. aftermarket , dealings were slim and featured a trade for a full cargo of February Brent paper at $ 22.95 , 4 cents higher than the IPE settlement price .
