the following are excerpts from the question and answer session following the first leg of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins address before Congress . 
Sen . d &apos;Amato ( R-NY ) : &quot; You recently testified ... that you supported a capital gains tax rate of zero ... What impact do you believe such a tax cut would have on the average American citizen ? 
Greenspan : &quot; The point I made at the Budget Committee ... was that if the capital gains tax were eliminated , that we would presumably , over time , see increased economic growth which would raise revenues for the personal and corporate income taxes as well as the other taxes we have . 
&quot; It &apos;s not clear exactly to what extent the degree of revenue would be fully offset losing the taxes that are associated with the capital gains tax itself . 
the crucial issue about the capital gains tax is not its revenue-raising capacity . 
indeed , it &apos;s major impact ... is to impede entrepreneurial activity and capital formation . 
&quot; While all taxes impede economic growth to one extent or another , the capital gains tax is at the far end of the scale . 
I argued that the appropriate capital gains tax rate was zero , and short of that any cuts in the specialty indexing would , in my judgment , be an act that would be appropriate policy for this Congress . 
d &apos;Amato : &quot; You have noted that the increasing usage of retail sweep accounts by banks in order to get around the reserve requirements because they don &apos;t get interest on those requirements was something of a concern . 
how serious a threat to implementing monetary policy are these sweep accounts ? 
Greenspan : &quot; What that does is affect our reserve position and our ability to employ a standard of open-market monetary policy to affect the financial condition of the banking system and the markets . 
&quot; Part of the problem is being offset by the fact that even though reserve balances are falling as a result of the sweep accounts , clearing balances required and otherwise , which banks use for the purpose of obtaining services from the Federal Reserve , have been reasonably high . 
&quot; We have not felt any specific problem in implementing monetary policy . 
&quot; Far more important , however , is that this is truly a technical issue . 
if we were to run into difficulty , there are many other regimes of implementation of monetary policy which we could bring forth . 
it could be an inconvenience , but it would not be anything we consider to be a serious problem . 
&quot; We are concerned especially during periods like the one that just passed where reserves are low because of seasonal reasons . 
d &apos;Amato : &quot; Should Congress authorize the Fed to pay interest on bank reserves ? 
Greenspan : &quot; We have always argued that were we to pay interest on bank reserves that the problem a number of banks were having with respect to the so-called &apos; sterile &apos; reserves on their balance sheets would disappear . 
we &apos;ve advocated that , and indeed we &apos;ve advocated the abolishment of the restriction on the payment of interest on demand deposits as well . 
&quot; The problem is that that would induce a fairly significant reduction in federal budget receipts . 
a substantial amount of payment on those reserves clearly offsets the amount we would be paying out . 
&quot; However , I would stipulate that as reserves fall , the aggregate amount we &apos;re paying ... declines , so that it may become an issue which gradually disappears by itself .
