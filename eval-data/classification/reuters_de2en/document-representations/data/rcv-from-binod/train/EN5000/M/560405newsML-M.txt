implied volatilities for dollar / pair options were mixed in U.S. trading Monday as national holidays in Britain and Japan contributed to an overall quiet tone . 
dollar / yen volatility edged lower , reflecting lackluster movement in the spot market , but dollar / mark volatility firmed a bit as the U.S. currency pushed above 1.73 marks . 
anticipation of the French general elections , which get under way March 25 , is beginning to support dollar / mark volatility , options traders said . 
at midday , one-month dollar / mark implied volatility was 8.50 / 8.70 percent , slightly above the 8.40 / 8.70 quoted Friday . 
one-year was 9.10 / 9.25 percent , up from 9.00 / 9.30 previously . 
options traders predicted spot dollar would have a tough time plowing through resistance at 1.7350 marks and intervals on up through 1.7500 . 
&quot; People would love to sell dollar / mark at the 1.7450 , 1.7500 level , &quot; said a chief trader at an East Coast bank . 
the U.S. economic calendar , in contrast to last week , contains little to excite foreign exchange markets , traders said . 
&quot; I think spot is going to be dead in the water this week , &quot; said the East Coast trader . 
last week , the soft employment cost index and strong U.S. gross domestic product report offset each other , limiting dollar pairs to tight ranges , noted a New York-based trader for a Japanese bank . 
&quot; This week we started off in the same mood , &quot; he said . 
&quot; yen volatility is well offered on the back of this lackluster movement in the spot market . 
one-month dollar / yen implied volatility slipped to 8.20 / 8.30 percent from 8.25 / 8.50 Friday . 
the one-year edged down to 9.20 / 9.30 percent from 9.25 / 9.40 previously . 
dollar / yen was bid at 126.55 around midday . 
activity in the options market suggests participants are negative on dollar / yen short term but still bullish further down the road , the Japanese bank trader said . 
on Friday , he said , one- to three-month yen calls / dollar puts were bought in strikes of 123.00 to 120.00 , while a large six-month 130.00 dollar call / yen put also was purchased . 
&quot; The basic scenario in the marketplace is dollar / yen will go lower in the one- to three-month period and then go up again in the midterm . 
we will see down and up movement from here , &quot; the trader predicted . 
those buying short-dated yen calls are hoping a coordinated central bank intervention will take the market by surprise and provide the catalyst for a dollar downmove , he said . 
&quot; I tend to regard this quiet in the market as the calm before the storm , the trader added . 
one-month 25-delta dollar / yen risk reversals were skewed 0.1 / 0.3 to yen calls . 
risk reversals measure the pricing differential between puts and calls . 
the one-month dollar / mark risk reversal was flat to 0.2 favoring mark puts .
