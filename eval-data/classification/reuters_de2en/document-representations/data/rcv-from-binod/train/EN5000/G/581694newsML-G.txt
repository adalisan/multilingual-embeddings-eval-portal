intentionally walking giants slugger Barry Bonds must have seemed like a good idea at the time . 
with Darryl Hamilton and Bill Mueller on second and third in the third inning , the reds elected to walk Barry Bonds , preferring to take their chances with Jeff Kent . 
Kent smashed a 3-2 pitch from reds starter Dave Burba ( 3-4 ) over the left-field fence for his eighth Homer of the season and fourth career grand slam , providing the giants with all four of their runs . 
&quot; I hit a fastball high and away , I was looking for a fastball , &quot; said Kent , who defended Cincinnati &apos;s decision to load the bases by walking Bonds . 
&quot; It &apos;s a no-brainer , he &apos;s the best hitter in the game so if there &apos;s a base open they &apos;re going to put him on , &quot; added Kent , who struck out in his other three at-bats but leads the giants with 34 RBI . 
&quot; They &apos;ll be careful with Barry until the day he dies , even in old-timers games , &quot; giants manager dusty Baker predicted . 
Shawn Estes allowed one run over 7 1 / 3 innings as San Francisco posted its third consecutive win . 
Estes ( 5-2 ) gave up five hits with four walks and six strikeouts , holding the reds scoreless though seven innings .

Todd Zeile hit a solo Homer in the seventh for the dodgers . 
Astacio ( 3-1 ) carried a five-hitter into the eighth , but issued a two-out walk to Mark Grace before Sosa lined a 2-0 pitch over the centre-field fence for his sixth Homer . 
in Montreal , Pedro Martinez pitched his second complete game of the season to raise his record to a perfect 6-0 as the Expos beat the San Diego Padres 7-3 . 
Martinez gave up 11 singles and three runs -- two earned -- while striking out seven , marking the first time this year he has allowed more than one earned run . 
in 45 1 / 3 innings , he has allowed only four earned runs for a league-leading ERA of 0.79 . 
Montreal got all the runs it needed with a four-run outburst in the first inning off starter Fernando Valenzuela ( 1-5 ) capped by Henry Rodriguez &apos;s three-run Homer .

with one out in the bottom of the inning , Huskey drilled a 1-1 pitch from Russ Springer ( 1-1 ) into the left-field bullpen for his seventh Homer and a 4-3 advantage .
