the United States will support a Danish resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission criticising China &apos;s rights record despite Chinese warnings of diplomatic consequences , a U.S. spokesman said on Thursday . 
in a statement to Reuters , the spokesman said that if Beijing wanted to improve its bilateral ties , a &quot; good starting point &quot; would be for it to make progress on improving respect for human rights . 
Denmark is to formally present its draft text later in the day It is sponsored by the United States and mainly European states , although support is shrinking , according to Western diplomats . 
&quot; The U.S. is supporting Denmark &apos;s resolution because we believe that the Human Rights Commission is a fundamentally appropriate forum in which to discuss the human rights situation in China , &quot; a spokesman for the U.S. human rights delegation in Geneva told Reuters . 
&quot; China knows this and it also knows that if it wants to improve bilateral relations with the United States , a good starting point would be for it to make progress on improving human rights in China , &quot; the U.S. spokesman added . 
but Western support for the motion appears to be crumbling , making it increasingly likely that Beijing escapes censure again for the seventh straight year when the 53-member forum votes next Tuesday , according to diplomatic sources . 
Australia announced on Thursday it had struck a deal with China to set up a formal bilateral dialogue on human rights , but revealed it would no longer back the Danish motion . 
Canada may also be edging away from supporting the text , diplomats said . 
China warned the United States on Thursday that relations could suffer if it continued to support Denmark &apos;s resolution at the U.N. body , which is holding its annual meeting in Geneva . 
both the United States and China have moved painstakingly in recent months to ease strains over disputes ranging from Taiwan to trade and human rights that sent ties plummeting in 1995 and early 1996 . 
&quot; Sino-U.S. relations have already seen improvements , but the U.S. support of Denmark will , of course , damage bilateral relations , &quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing in Beijing . 
&quot; The U.S. government should resolve this problem from the basis of bilateral relations , &quot; he added . 
Shen repeated warnings that Denmark &apos;s decision to press ahead with U.N. criticism of China &apos;s human rights policies would damage ties . 
&quot; Denmark should consider its national interests and consider seriously the consequences , &quot; he said . 
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said on Tuesday his country would not back down from tabling the motion despite warnings from Beijing of a political and trade backlash . 
a U.S. human rights official in Geneva told Reuters on Tuesday that the draft had at least 12 co-sponsors so far . 
Washington would lobby intensively in capitals worldwide to clinch crucial swing votes , he added . 
but he said China was expected to present its own &quot; no-action motion &quot; seeking to quash all debate on Tuesday when the Danish motion is up for a vote . 
last year 27 states voted in favour of China &apos;s no-action motion , 20 voted against with six abstentions . 
in its annual human rights report for 1996 , the U.S. State Department said China had effectively silenced public dissent by jailing or exiling virtually every active dissident . 
concern over China has been heightened at the U.N. human rights &apos; main forum this year due to the prospect of Hong Kong reverting to the mainland on July 1 . 
human rights groups are concerned Hong Kong &apos;s 6.4 million people will enjoy fewer political and civil freedoms under the rule of Beijing , which has not signed major global rights pacts . 
Hong Kong &apos;s future leader Tung Chee-hwa on Wednesday proposed measures to curtail protests and foreign funding for political parties after the transfer -- drawing criticism form Martin Lee , leader of Hong Kong &apos;s democracy movement , and British colonial Governor Chris Patten . 
Tung &apos;s plan was expected after China &apos;s parliament resolved in late February that several existing Hong Kong laws protecting civil liberties and rights should be repealed or amended . 
societies and political parties would have to be registered and might be refused registration if they are known to have foreign ties to or receive funds from abroad . 
demonstrations would need police authorisation seven days in advance .
