British author Salman Rushdie is to receive a literary award in the Danish capital next week despite fears for his safety which led Denmark &apos;s government to try to postpone his visit . 
a joint statement by the Danish Rushdie Committee , the ministry of culture and Cultural Capital 96 said that the exact location of the award ceremony would not be made public and Rushdie would not be available for interviews during his visit . 
Rushdie is one of three winners of European Union prizes , two for literature and one for translation , to be presented in Copenhagen , this year &apos;s European Cultural Capital . 
&quot; All three prizewinners ... will be present at the awards presentation , &quot; the statement said . 
Indian-born Rushdie has lived in hiding and under guard since 1989 when Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa or death sentence against him for his novel &quot; The satanic verses &quot; , saying it blasphemed against Islam . 
last week , Denmark told him not to come and collect his prize because it was unable to guarantee his safety , sparking a furious row in which the minority government was threatened with a vote of no-confidence .
