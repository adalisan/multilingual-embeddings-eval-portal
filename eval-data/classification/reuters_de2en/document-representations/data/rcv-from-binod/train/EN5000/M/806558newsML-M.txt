European bond markets will continue to faithfully follow U.S. treasuries , despite tentative signs of a decoupling in recent weeks , analysts said on Monday . 
yields in both markets will continue to trek higher amid an upturn in economic growth , but the U.S. will have a slight edge thanks to its head start in the interest rate cycle . 
&quot; We are seeing a pretty healthy global upswing , &quot; said Ian Amstad , senior economist at Bankers Trust in London . 
&quot; Rates are probably too low in both the U.S. and Europe and bond yields will need to go up . 
he said although the U.S. was at greater risk from inflation , low European interest rates coupled with expectations of growth picking up next year would put upward pressure on long term rates in Europe too . 
but for now , U.S. inflation was under control and few people were expecting a change in interest rate policy at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday . 
&quot; We are still getting good inflation news and should continue to do so but people realise that if the U.S. economy keeps on growing quickly then inflation will at some point pick up , &quot; said Amstad . 
he said the eventual move to higher interest rates would lead to some sell-off in bond markets , but it might not be a full blown rout as people recognised the need to slow down the economy and avert future inflationary risks . 
&quot; That kind of sober assessment is coming back into play , &quot; Amstad said . 
&quot; People realise that the party can &apos;t go on indefinitely . 
John McNeill , bond strategist at I.D.E.A. 
said the debate about whether or not the U.S. economy would slow down in the second half of the year was still unresolved . 
&quot; But the lesson of the last month or so has been that European growth is going to be closer to U.S. growth than previously anticipated , &quot; he said . 
he said the U.S. bond market would outperform Europe continuing the recent narrowing trend of the T-note / Bund spread . 
&quot; I can see the spread going to 50 initially and then potentially below that on a four-week horizon , &quot; he said . 
at 1248 GMT , the 10-year T-note / Bund yield spread was at 68 basis points , little changed from its level at the beginning of the year but sharply in from 119 basis points in mid-April . 
however , some analysts foresaw spreads moving further out . 
&quot; In tandem both markets will be rising in yield terms , &quot; said Michael Burke , bond strategist at Citibank in London . 
&quot; Much will depend on the timing as much as the direction of interest rates . 
there could be a leapfrog effect with regard to German / U.S. 
yields depending on who raises first . 
he expected the U.S. to raise interest rates first which could send the spread out towards 100 basis points . 
the Bundesbank will resume regular policy meetings on Thursday after a summer break , amid speculation it would move to a variable rate repo or maintaining the fixed repo at higher level . 
but many analysts expected the Bundesbank to sit tight for now . 
Burke said all the major bond markets , outside Japan , were in for a rocky ride over the next few months and a defensive bond strategy should be adopted . 
&quot; The best place to be is in U.S. cash or near cash , which effectively means bills , &quot; he said .
