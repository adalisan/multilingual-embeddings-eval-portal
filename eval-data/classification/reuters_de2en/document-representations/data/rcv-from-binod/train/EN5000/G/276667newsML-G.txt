the Red Cross said on Thursday it had not received any reports of injuries to hostages in the Japanese embassy residence in Peru following a loud explosion there in the early hours of the morning . 
red Cross spokesman Roland Bigler told a news conference that initial unconfirmed information suggested the explosion was triggered by an animal , but did not give details . 
local newspapers have speculated the blast might have been caused by a cat treading on one of the mines the rebels reportedly have planted near the entrances to the residence . 
&quot; At this time we have no knowledge of injuries , &quot; Bigler said . 
red Cross officials could not be absolutely certain this meant no one had been hurt , he cautioned reporters . 
following the explosion a senior Red Cross delegate rushed to the scene , but when there was no request from either hostages or rebels for him to enter the residence he left without entering the building , Bigler said .
