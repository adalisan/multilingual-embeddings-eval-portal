1996 was a succesful year : economic growth ( measured by the total value added ) exceeded five percent , while the rate of inflation was supressed to below 20 percent . 
in the macro scale the final domestic demand became the force driving the economy . 
investment outlays rose by nearly 21 percent ( mainly purchases of machinery ) and the increase was higher than in 1995 . 
private consumption increased by over eight percent driven by a considerable increase of real wages and more importantly , the increase of banking loans , offered to households in various forms . 
it seemed that financing purchases of ( mainly ) durables with consumer credit was a forerunner of a change of the purchasing style among middle class households in Poland . 
total increase in the final domestic demand is estimaed at over 10 percent . 
exports were growing at a fast rate ( by almost 10 percent ) , but more slowly than in the past years . 
this was partly due to the poor economic performance of our western partners , as well as the further decline of economic activities in Russia and Ukraine . 
on the other hand , imports grew much faster -- by almost 30 percent ( according to Gus foreign trade records ) . 
a large part of this increase was caused by investment and it was financed from direct foreign investments , which rose to $ 5 bln in 1996 . 
the growing foreign trade deficit was a result of the policy aimed at a systematic appreciation of the zloty . 
the rate of real appreciation of the zloty dropped compared with 1995 . 
but the continuation of this policy adds to the decline in the profitability of exports and , given the phasing out of the border tax , makes imports relatively cheaper . 
the main characteristic of the forecast is high growth of almost all components of domestic final demand and high growth rates of imports . 
it seems that the high propensity to invest will be sustained for the next years , due to such factors as : 
start of major technical retooling of large industrial enterprises ( both privatized or commercialized ) ; 
direct foreign investments ; 
housing investments , because one can expect that the recent crisis in housing output has ended . 
we expect the extremely high growth rate of imports recorded in 1996 to fall because of an increased saturation of the domestic market . 
however , imports will remain high and will cause a further build-up of the trade deficit . 
consequently , an accumulation of tensions in the balance of payments can be expected , and an additional , one-off devaluation of the zloty ( which is not included in our forecasts ) cannot be ruled out . 
as a result of growing trade deficit the increase in GDP as calculated in constant basic prices ( gross value added ) will be slightly lower than the final domestic product growth . 
it will be characterized by a moderately high growth of 4-5 percent annually . 
this growth will be close to the increase in the total capacity output , so we do not expect a growth in capacity utilization which is at a relatively low level . 
hence , any overheating of the economy is out of question . 
we forecast that in the next years growth in production will be accompanied by a slow net increase in the number of jobs , so the average unemployment rate will still be high . 
the rate of inflation will keep falling , although at rates somewhat lower than envisaged in the budget law . 
provided that baseline assumptions in economic policy do not undergo any changes a continuation of the present economic development may be expected , combined with a higher absorbtion of its results by the households . 
at the same time , the high rates of investments that determine the future reconstruction of the economy will continue . 
this will be accompanied by a gradual decline in inflation . 
the above seems to generate a favourable climate for negotiating Poland &apos;s entry into the European Union within the next three to five years . 
however , potential risks should be kept within focus . 
these include , above all , tensions which build up in the balance of payments because of the growing foreign trade deficit . 
should populist changes take place in the economic policy , the above threats might aggrevate . 
exerting pressures on wages and demands of additional subsidies to agricultural production may lead to triggering an inflationary spiral and to deterioration of the expected profitability of production and investment in general and foreign direct investment .
