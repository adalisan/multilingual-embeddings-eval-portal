U.S. Midwest direct cash hogs early Thursday sold steady to $ 0.50 per cwt lower , with declines tied to lower pork prices and light demand from packers fighting unprofitable operating margins , livestock dealers and packer buyers said . 
lower pork prices continued to erode margins and erase any benefits to the packer associated with weaker cash hog prices so far this week , they said . 
&quot; They &apos;re not pushing too hard for hogs this morning , &quot; one central Indiana source said . 
light demand offset potential support for cash hog prices from light marketings , sources said .
