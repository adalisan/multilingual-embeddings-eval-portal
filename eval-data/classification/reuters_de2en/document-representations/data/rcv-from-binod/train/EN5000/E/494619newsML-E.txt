April 1997 . 
the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is Europe &apos;s most dollar 
sensitive . 
about 40 percent of profits of bourse-listed 
companies stem from dollar areas . 
the Dutch economy as a whole is , however , much more 
dependent on Germany , the Netherlands &apos; biggest trading partner . 
the Dutch central bank &apos;s primary goal therefore is to keep 
the guilder as closely pegged to the mark as possible . 
the Dutch government bond market usually tracks its German 
counterpart , except when inflation and budget deficits in both 
countries show a sudden divergence . 
the Dutch economy is among the world &apos;s least volatile due to 
steady exports of natural gas and agricultural products . 
the 
country &apos;s generous welfare system also helps make the Dutch 
economy fairly resistent to the economic cycle . 
but the social security system has contributed to structural 
problems like high ( hidden ) unemployment and a large state debt . 
Dutch consensus politics -- the necessity to seek 
compromises because no single party has a parliamentary majority 
-- is widely blamed for failing to curb abuse of the welfare 
system or cut the level of benefits . 
the last parliamentary election took place in May 1994 and a 
three-party coalition government made up of the socialist Labour 
office in August 1994 . 
in provincial elections in March 1995 the Liberals emerged 
as the biggest party .
