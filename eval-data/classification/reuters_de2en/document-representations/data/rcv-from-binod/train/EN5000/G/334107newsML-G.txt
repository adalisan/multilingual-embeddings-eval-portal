Tottenham Hotspur striker Teddy Sheringham is almost certain to miss England &apos;s vital World Cup qualifier against Italy next month after limping out of a training session on Monday with a nagging ankle injury . 
Sheringham , who scored in England &apos;s last match in Georgia , was testing the strength of his ankle for the first time since damaging it in training three weeks ago . 
but he failed to complete the session and now appears unlikely to face Italy at Wembley on February 12 . 
England manager Glenn Hoddle is due to name his squad on Thursday .
