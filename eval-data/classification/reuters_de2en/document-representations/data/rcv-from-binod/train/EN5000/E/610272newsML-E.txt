foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi said the mix of savings and fresh revenue to be contained in Italy &apos;s 25 trillion lire deficit-cutting budget for 1998 had not yet been defined . 
&quot; The 25 trillion lire figure is confirmed but there are no details yet about the contents , &quot; Fantozzi told reporters while attending a CISL trades union congress . 
Italian newspapers have reported the budget will contain some 17 trillion lire of state spending cuts , including eight trillion in social welfare cuts , with some eight trillion coming from increased revenue . 
the 1998 budget will be outlined in the government &apos;s annual document of three-year rolling economic targets ( DPEF ) which is set for cabinet approval late next week . 
asked to confirm the figure of eight trillion lire of planned spending cuts on welfare and pensions , Fantozzi said &quot; this figure has been mentioned in the press but there &apos;s nothing definite yet . 
Fantozzi said he agreed with a call on Thursday by employers &apos; body Confindustria chairman Giorgio Fossa for the government to speed up work on the DPEF and 1998 budget so as not to miss Italy &apos;s appointment with EMU . 
but no one &apos;s sleeping , &quot; he said .
