Mexican interest rates may continue to fall and even reach 1994 levels , said Pedro Zorrilla Velasco , chairman of the Mexican Bankers &apos; Association . 
&quot; I think that ( interest rates ) will at least be at the levels we have right now , without ruling out further falls , and we may reach similar levels to the end of 1994 , &quot; Zorrilla said . 
&quot; The expectation is that ... if the inflationary outlook comes down , as it has been , rates will keep falling further , &quot; he added . 
&quot; A tight monetary policy is spoken of as a necessary evil . 
I would say monetary discipline has allowed interest rates to come down faster than a lax policy , &quot; Zorrilla said .
