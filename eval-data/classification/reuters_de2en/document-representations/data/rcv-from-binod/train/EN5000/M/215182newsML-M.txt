Greek overnight funds headed higher to 13.40 percent and shorts were well bid on the heels of a liquidity squeeze but implied rates from forex forwards dipped 15 basis points in longer tenors as players rushed to unwind positions , dealers said . 
the central bank injected overnight cash at an unchanged 13.40 percent to smooth out market liquidity . 
&quot; The system turned short again driving overnight rates up to the central bank &apos;s 13.40 percent , &quot; said a dealer at a private bank . 
&quot; The liquidity shortage will be exagerated on Tuesday when payments for FRNs and bonds take effect . 
Greece auctioned about 200 billion drachmas worth of seven-year FRNs with the first coupon at 13.40 percent , the 12-month T-bill rate set at 12 percent and the spread at 10 basis points last Friday . 
it also auctioned 100 billion drachmas of three-year , 11 percent coupon bonds . 
secondary bond trading on the newly auctioned paper picked up driving prices close to par , bond dealers said . 
the average accepted bid was 100.361 for the seven-year floaters and 99.823 for the three-year coupon bond . 
the stop out was at 100.303 for the FRNs and 99.550 for the bond . 
other dealers said implied drachma rates from forex forwards had eased 15 basis points in late trade as players sought to unwind positions . 
&quot; Some foreign players that did not get what they expected from the auction sought to unwind their funding , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; This coupled with some light-to-medium selling of outstanding FRN issues has pushed longer tenors in forex forwards lower 15 basis points . 
the mark was quoted at 157.23 / 33 drachmas from Monday &apos;s 157.340 fix , the dollar at 238.21 / 31 drachmas from 238.080 and the Ecu at 303.05 / 15 from 303.320 drachmas .
