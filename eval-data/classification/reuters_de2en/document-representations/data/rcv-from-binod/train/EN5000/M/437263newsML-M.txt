the Sri Lanka rupee was stuck in a narrow range early on Wednesday in trade dominated by speculation , dealers said . 
at 0500 GMT , the rupee was at its opening level of 57.65 to the dollar after gaining briefly to 57.62 on some early selling of the greenback , they said . 
&quot; There is no trade-backed demand as yet and speculators are playing around , &quot; said an American Express bank dealer . 
despite low overnight call money rates , banks were not willing to build big dollar positions since they were not sure how far the U.S. unit would rise overseas , dealers said . 
&quot; Whatever happens overseas , the dollar seems stable at current levels locally until a big import bill comes to the market , &quot; said a Standard Chartered dealer . 
the Central Bank pushed up the dollar by 2.5 local cents and fixed buying and selling rates at 57.1245 and 58.2785 . 
overnight call rates were at the opening level of 11.75 percent after falling briefly to 11.5 percent , dealers said .
