Hong Kong &apos;s democracy movement on Friday likened Beijing &apos;s plans to curb civil liberties in the territory to the brutal purges of China &apos;s radical 1966-76 Cultural Revolution . 
the pro-democracy camp staged a small but noisy protest on Friday morning at the office of post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa , who will succeed British Governor Chris Patten after the handover at midnight on June 30 . 
&quot; Protect freedom of assembly . 
protect freedom of association , &quot; they shouted . 
&quot; Human rights cannot be infringed upon . 
a handful wore tall hats and hung labels around their necks , harking back to the Cultural Revolution when those who were politically persecuted were forced to wear dunce caps and hang boards around their necks with their names crossed out . 
they were paraded through the streets and beaten . 
many died . 
pro-democracy activists are campaigning against plans to scrap or amend 25 Hong Kong laws , some of them crucial to civil liberties , on July 1 . 
laws facing the axe include parts of the Bill of Rights and laws allowing freedom of assembly and association . 
the Hong Kong group called for an all-night sit-down protest outside China &apos;s de facto embassy , the Xinhua News Agency branch office , opposite the Happy Valley race course . 
other protests were planned for Sunday . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we can be masters of our own house , &quot; Yeung sum , deputy leader of the Democratic Party , told reporters when asked what the latest developments boded for the autonomy that China has promised Hong Kong after the handover . 
&quot; The Chinese Communist Party is master of the house , and Mr Tung is the servant of the Chinese Communist party , &quot; he said . 
democratic Party leader Martin Lee called a news conference for later in the day and was due to set off on an eight-nation tour of Europe on Sunday to lobby for support for human rights , freedom and democracy in post-handover Hong Kong . 
the reduction of civil liberties was proposed by a China-controlled committee last Sunday and would be implemented by a provisional legislature that China is installing in July to replace the elected Legislative Council . 
the provisional body was to convene for its first sitting across the border in the Chinese city of Shenzhen on Saturday , when it is to elect its president and set rules of procedure . 
Britain is handing Hong Kong back to China , after more than 150 years of colonial rule , under a 1984 treaty in which China promised to preserve the territory &apos;s capitalist system and freewheeling way of life for a further half century . 
Hong Kong &apos;s leading English-language newspaper , the South China Morning Post , voiced concern that the changes would scrap a habeas corpus law that curbs police rights to detain people . 
&quot; It prevents people from being arbitrarily arrested and held without trial , or detained without good reason , &quot; the newspaper said . 
&quot; Habeas corpus is one of the greatest safeguards to individual liberty in the canon of law . 
Tung and Patten duelled verbally on Thursday . 
Tung defended the changes , saying they were necessary to strike &quot; the right balance between individual rights and social order &quot; . 
Tung said other states required permits for demonstrations and set limits on the overseas links of political groups , two of the changes that are worrying the pro-democracy camp . 
Patten heaped scorn on the proposals , which have drawn Britain and the United States into a new diplomatic quarrel with Beijing . 
China has rejected their protests as &quot; unwise &quot; .
