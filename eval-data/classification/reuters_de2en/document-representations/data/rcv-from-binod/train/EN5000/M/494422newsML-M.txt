the Sri Lanka rupee closed down against the dollar on Tuesday due to late import covering and speculation , dealers said . 
the rupee closed at 58.50 to the dollar after recovering from the day &apos;s low of 58.60 , they said . 
the rupee opened at 58.40 . 
&quot; The rupee held its own early on low commercial demand . 
and speculators kept away from the forex market due to early volatility in call rates , &quot; said a Union Bank dealer . 
call money rates closed at 14 percent after opening at 19 and rising to 27 due to heavy cash withdrawals ahead of next week &apos;s Sinhala and Tamil New year , dealers said . 
&quot; speculators focused on forex when call rates eased and together with import covering this pushed down the rupee , &quot; said the Union Bank dealer . 
speculators expect the Central Bank to set a lower rupee value against the dollar on Wednesday in line with overseas gains for the U.S. unit , dealers said . 
the Central Bank on Tuesday pushed up the dollar by 9.75 local cents in line with its overseas gains , fixing buying and selling prices at 57.7244 and 58.8906 .
