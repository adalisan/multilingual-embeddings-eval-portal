Estonia &apos;s bourse index crossed the 300 boundary for the first time on Wednesday as buying interest in Hansapank and Forekspank kept shares on an upward roll . 
&quot; There are lots of buyers and not many sellers about and the prices of most stocks were forced higher , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; But we do expect a correction , especially in Hansa and Hoiupank , but we can &apos;t say when it will happen , &quot; he added . 
total trade on the main list was 53.8 million kroons with the Talse index 1.53 percent higher at 302.29 . 
most dealers have been expecting a correction for the last three days and say it is too hard to pick the bourse &apos;s direction . 
Hansapank led the main list , rising by 2.1 kroons to close at 168.50 kroons on trade of 19.2 million kroons . 
Hansapank in Helsinki also reached a new high , closing up 1.1 markka at 63.10 markka on volume of 2.1 million markka . 
&quot; The buying interest in Hansa is holding , while in Helsinki the bid / ask was 63.10 / 64.00 , so tomorrow will depend on what dealers have on their books to start the day , &quot; a dealer said . 
Forekspank released a revised profit forecast for 1997 of 96.4 million kroons . 
it closed up 2.75 kroons up at 201.10 on trade of 12 million kroons . 
&quot; Forekspank is still a cheap stock on the bourse , so it is hard to say how far it could go , &quot; one trader said . 
on the free market , privatisation securities dominated with 48.1 million kroons traded . 
they again closed higher on 0.43 kroons compared to 0.385 kroons on Tuesday . 
&quot; There are no sellers at all and the price just keeps on rising , &quot; one trader said . 
demand has been high for the compensation vouchers as investors anticipate the sale of stakes in Eesti Gaas and Hotel Olympia for vouchers .
