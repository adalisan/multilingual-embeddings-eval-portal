the Canadian Wheat Board reduced its September pool Return outlooks ( pros ) for wheat and feed barley prices for the 1996 / 97 ( August / July ) crop year by $ 15 and $ 7 per tonne on promising output , the CWB said . 
the pros are a monthly Board estimate of world prices but not connected to CWB initial payments to farmers , which were announced July 29 and took effect August 1 , 1996 . 
benchmark No1 Canada Western Red Spring Wheat pros dropped to the $ 217- $ 237 range from the $ 232- $ 252 range in August . 
No1 Canada Western Feed barley fell to $ 150- $ 170 from the $ 157- $ 177 range in July . 
special select Canada Western Two-Row Malting barley prices rose to the $ 225- $ 245 range from July &apos;s $ 230- $ 250 . 
durum wheat slipped to $ 205- $ 235 from $ 210- $ 240 . 
Six-row malt barley slipped to $ 185- $ 205 from $ 191- $ 211 . 
the CWB said wheat prices dropped on improved wheat output prospects in several major exporting and importing regions . 
global wheat production is projected to increase by eight percent over last year . 
with most of this increase expected to occur in the five major exporting regions , the market anticipates more intense competition , driving prices down substantially from this spring . 
despite projections for relatively tight world stocks at the end of 1996-97 , the European Union ( EU ) has resumed the use of export subsidies on wheat sales to markets previously buying commercially . 
barley prices fell this month because of increased projections for EU barley production . 
production was projected to be up 16 percent from a year ago . 
Favorable crop quality prospects caused two-row and six-row barley prices to drop . 
rains aided Australia &apos;s two-row crop and EU &apos;s malting barley was better than expected . 
the U.S. , a major customer for Canadian six-row barley , has completed its harvest with better than expected quality which may reduce demand for Canadian supplies .
