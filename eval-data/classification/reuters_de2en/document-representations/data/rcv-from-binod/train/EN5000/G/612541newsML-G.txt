Sri Lankan troops resumed an offensive against Tamil separatists on Saturday , meeting stiff resistance as they pushed deeper into rebel-held territory in the island &apos;s north , military officials said . 
the drive restarted at first light on Saturday , they said , after troops paused for about five days to strengthen gains they made in a 14 km ( nine-mile ) thrust into the rebels &apos; northern Wanni heartland . 
&quot; troops have moved out of their positions in Omanthai and have begun to advance further north from there , &quot; one official told Reuters . 
military officials in the north said the rebels had offered stiff resistance just north of Omanthai . 
they said the military and the rebels continued to fire artillery and mortar rounds at each other . 
they added that up to 3,000 navy ground troops had been deployed in the Omanthai area to secure the area , allowing the army to resume its push north . 
troops captured Omanthai , 14 km ( nine miles ) north of the government-held town of Vavuniya , and Nedunkeni , 40 miles ( 25 km ) northeast of Vavuniya , last week in one of the biggest offensives against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) . 
civilian sources in Vavuniya told Reuters army casualties had begun arriving in the town from about 10 a.m. ( 0400 GMT ) , which indicated that heavy fighting was taking place . 
other military officials said the rebels had launched a drive to collect blood in the eastern Batticaloa district , 200 km ( 125 miles ) from Colombo . 
&quot; It is quite possible the LTTE have moved their wounded , or plan to move their wounded from the fresh fighting , into the east for treatment , &quot; an official said . 
some 20,000 troops backed by tanks , artillery and air cover launched &quot; Operation Jaya Sikuru &quot; , or &quot; sure of Victory &quot; , from Vavuniya on May 13 in a bid to open a supply route to Jaffna peninsula , 100 km ( 60 miles ) further north . 
Vavuniya lies 220 km ( 135 miles ) north of the capital Colombo . 
the LTTE , fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in mainly Sinhalese Sri Lanka &apos;s north and east , control vast swathes of land in the mostly shrub-covered Wanni between Jaffna and Vavuniya . 
government forces rely on air and sea links to supply bases and civilians in Jaffna , the LTTE &apos;s former would-be homeland the military brought under government control one year ago . 
according to Defence Ministry figures , 67 soldiers have been killed and 96 wounded in the offensive . 
hospital sources have said some 600 soldiers had been wounded . 
the LTTE said 59 rebels had died in the fighting up to Thursday . 
the government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the ethnic war , now in its 14th year .
