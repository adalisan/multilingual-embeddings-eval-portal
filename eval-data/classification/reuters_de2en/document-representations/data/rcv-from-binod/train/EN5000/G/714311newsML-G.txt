a suspect in the 1996 truck bombing that killed 19 American servicemen in Saudi Arabia said in an interview that he was in Iran at the time , the New York Times reported on Tuesday . 
the suspect , Hani Abdel Rahim Hussein al-Sayegh , was accused by law enforcement officials of acting as the driver and the lookout in the attack on Khobar Towers , a U.S. military housing complex in Dhahran . 
Sayegh said in an interview that his passport bears a stamp indicating he entered Iran before the bombing and that a Kuwait airline manifest showed he left Iran for Kuwait shortly after the June 25 , 1996 , bombing , the New York Times reported . 
he said several people could corroborate his presence in Iran at the time of the attack , according to the newspaper . 
the New York Times said he spoke through an interpreter by telephone from an undisclosed location in the Washington area , where he is being held following his deportation from Canada . 
he was taken to the United States under an arrangement in which he was expected to plead guilty to conspiracy for his role in a separate , unsuccesful plot to scout U.S. installations in Saudi Arabia as possible terrorist targets . 
Sayegh has not entered a plea but may face a court hearing on the indictment as soon as this week . 
in the interview Sayegh described himself as a Saudi dissident who once lived in Iran and that the Saudis had made him a scapegoat , the Times said . 
information of his alleged involvement in the bombing was given to U.S. and Canadian authorities by the Saudi government .
