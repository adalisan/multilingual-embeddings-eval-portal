U.S. spot propane prices were mostly steady in very quiet trade late on Wednesday despite stronger NYMEX futures , traders said . 
in the U.S. Gulf Coast , the bid price for Mont Belvieu , Texas , propane drifted a quarter cent lower to 48.00 cents a gallon , with sellers remaining at 48.50 cents . 
traders said talk was extremely thin , and the majority of interest was on the outer months . 
&quot; It looks like most people have gotten covered . 
there doesn &apos;t seem to be that much anxiety with the month ending , &quot; said one Houston-based broker . 
Belvieu October crude was trading at 48.00 / 48.25 cents , players said . 
Conway , Kansas material stayed steady at 47.00 / 47.25 cents , traders said , with farm cooperatives still interested in barrels as fuel to drive crop drying equipment . 
traders said the market may have a weakening sentiment given that propane , often tied to NYMEX , did not rise up with November crude oil futures . 
November crude oil ended up 39 cents and $ 24.46 a barrel . 
anticipation ahead of American Petroleum Institute data expected out later this week also kept a lid on trade .
