anyone wanting to see goals in Europe this weekend should look no further than the top clash in Spain in which champions Atletico Madrid make the daunting trip to Barcelona , the team fast emerging as the heir apparent . 
in recent years the fixture has produced a feast of goals and the arrival at the Camp Nou of Brazilian prodigy Ronaldo suggests that the trend will be maintained . 
Ronaldo and compatriot Giovanni were in superb form as Barcelona warmed up for the season with a 5-3 victory over Atletico in the Spanish Super Cup but it was a scoreline which was only to be expected from two of Spain &apos;s most attacking sides . 
Barcelona took the corresponding league fixture in 1993-94 by the same scoreline and then won 4-3 the following season . 
the 1992-93 game had ended with a more modest 1-1 draw but this was no doubt because the Barcelona strikers were exhausted after finishing off an 11-0 aggregate Cup victory over Atletico just days before . 
in the first of last season &apos;s fixtures , Atletico , galvanised by the inspirational Jose Luis Caminero , turned the tables . 
they threatened a similar demolition but , in the end , had to be content with a mere 3-1 victory -- a result they repeated in the return match at Camp Nou . 
that second defeat was too much for the demanding Barcelona fans . 
it completed a dismal 10 days in which they had lost the Spanish Cup final -- a 1-0 defeat at the hands , inevitably , of Atletico -- and gone out of the UEFA Cup against Bayern Munich . 
it was the beginning of the end of Johan Cruyff &apos;s eight years in charge at the Camp Nou . 
but for Atletico the match in Barcelona proved a decisive step in a championship campaign which ended in the club &apos;s first league and cup double . 
and for the Atletico fans , who had become the poor relations of the Spanish game as neighbours Real Madrid and Barcelona swept all before them , it was sweet revenge . 
whereas the two others enjoy glamorous nationwide and even international support , few Atletico die-hards are to be found outside the poorer areas of southern Madrid -- a crucial distinction in an age in which clubs increasingly depend on television contracts and merchandising rather than gate-money . 
it has meant that while the two &apos; grandees &apos; each have around nine billion pesetas ( $ 70 million ) to play with , Atletico get by with only a third of that amount in their annual kitty . 
it was always a source of concern but , after firing a battalion of coaches , controversial Atletico owner Jesus Gil finally settled on charismatic Serbian manager Radomir Antic , somebody who could make his pesetas go a long way . 
in last year &apos;s campaign Antic used a core of just 13 players and is again refusing to look for reinforcements when the transfer market reopens in December . 
for Barcelona , however , money is no object when it comes to buying players , despite a continuing squabble with Real Madrid over French international midfielder Christian Karembeu . 
the team is a focal point for the nationalist aspirations of the Catalonia region and frequently pulls in crowds of 100,000 . 
this huge support base means that multi-billion transfer deals are a luxury they can afford . 
the cheque book is always open . 
so when former England coach Bobby Robson wanted to bring with him acrobatic goalkeeper Vitor Baia from Porto and then pay PSV Eindhoven $ 20 million for Ronaldo , there were few objections . 
but Robson may have to face his first big challenge of the domestic season without some of the big names . 
both Baia and winger Luis Figo will miss Saturday &apos;s game because of international duty for Portugal and Ronaldo is doubtful because of an injury which kept him out of Monday &apos;s goalless draw at Sporting Gijon . 
Atletico have recovered international playmaker Caminero after a month &apos;s absence through injury but will be without suspended defender Delfi Geli and Czech midfielder Radek Bejbl , who is playing a World Cup qualifier .
