French September bond futures posted a late rally , driven by short covering , to leave the contract within a whisker of the 30-month high reached earlier in the session , traders said . 
they said trading had been driven throughout the day by technical levels , rather than any specific domestic factors , with the expiry of the contract on September 16 drawing closer . 
one trader said most would focus on the December contract tomorrow , now that the September contract had reached its main objective . 
open interest in the December contract surpassed that for the September contract on Tuesday for the first time . 
&quot; That &apos;s the end of September , it &apos;s reached its objectives , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; People will now try to get the December above 124.24 although the contract will need to find a good intermediate support first . 
the December contract also settled up 32 centimes at 122.76 . 
analysts said the U.S. bond market reaction to the Federal Reserve &apos;s Beige Book , an assessment of economic activity , due for release at 1600 GMT would determine Thursday &apos;s opening levels . 
any signs of accelerating inflation in either the Beige Book or in U.S. August PPI due at 1230 GMT tomorrow could undermine the recent bond market gains , they said . 
PIBOR contracts fluctuated in a fairly narrow range throughout the day , as did the franc . 
the franc slipped as low as 3.4167 early on Wednesday , rallied as high as 3.4104 and then slipped back to 3.4150 per mark at 1530 GMT . 
traders said there was little action in the cash market other than a continuation of good demand in the two-year area of the curve already seen this week . 
the 10-year yield spread over Bunds , using the 6.50 percent 2006 OAT , narrowed slightly to eight basis points from nine
