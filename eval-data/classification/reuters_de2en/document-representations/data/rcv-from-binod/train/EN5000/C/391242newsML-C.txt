Compaq Computer Corp. &apos; s latest offering , a personal desktop computer priced at less than $ 1,000 plus a monitor , hit the stores Thursday with a new Pentium-compatible chip expected to spawn a new generation of less expensive personal computers . 
packaged in a jet-black case that looks more like a VCR than a computer , the Compaq Presario 2000 series is aimed at families looking to buy a second computer or first-time buyers seeking a functional , affordable machine , executives said . 
with a $ 299 monitor , the system will cost about $ 1,300 , flirting with a $ 1,000 price tag that has emerged as this year &apos;s hottest personal computer category . 
&quot; This is an area from a price-point standpoint that really has not been reachable in the past . 
this is a first step we are taking , &quot; said Sean Burke , director of the consumer group at Compaq , the world &apos;s largest computer maker . 
the Presario 2100 , the first offering in Compaq &apos;s Presario 2000 series , features a 133-megahertz processor , 24 megabytes of random access memory , a 33,600 baud modem for surfing the Internet and a two-gigabyte hard drive . 
the newest Compaq Presarios are based on Cyrix Corp. &apos; s MediaGX , a Pentium-compatible chip the company is promoting as a foundation for a new generation of less expensive desktop computers . 
&quot; This is the first time a microprocessor company other than Intel is introducing a technology that is enabling PC manufacturers to enter new markets , &quot; Steve Tobak , Cyrix vice president of corporate marketing , said . 
Microprocessors from Intel Corp. , the world &apos;s largest chipmaker , are installed in about 80 percent of personal computers . 
Cyrix and other microprocessor makers are targeting that market with Pentium-compatible chips that mimic the Intel chip but cost much less . 
analysts doubt the new generation of less expensive computers will lure first-time buyers into stores , but said the machines will be attractive to computer owners and families looking for a second machine . 
&quot; Compaq is going to hit home more with those people who have a PC , including people who bought a PC recently who found that the PC they bought doesn &apos;t fulfil all their needs , &quot; said Richard Zwetchkenbaum , an industry analyst with International Data Corp. in Framingham , Mass . 
of the nearly 100 million households in the United States , 37 percent own a personal computer , up about 2 percent from the prior year . 
PC sales to homes with two or more computers are expected to grow at a much faster pace , Zwetchkenbaum said . 
Compaq executives said they expected the new Presario series to be attractive as a second machine in U.S. households where parents and children share an existing PC , but saw the low price drawing in first-time buyers in other countries . 
&quot; outside the U.S. , it &apos;s going to start to grow the penetration rates fairly significantly , &quot; Rod Schrock , vice president of Presario product development said . 
news of the first personal computer to use the Cyrix chip sent the Richardson , Texas-based company &apos;s shares up $ 4.25 a share to $ 29.75 , while Intel shares slumped $ 2.50 to $ 151.375 on the Nasdaq stock market . 
shares in Houston-based Compaq were off $ 1 at $ 84.375 on the New York Stock Exchange in midday trading .
