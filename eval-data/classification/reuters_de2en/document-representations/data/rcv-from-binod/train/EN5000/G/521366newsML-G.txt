British managers are disillusioned with the tax policies of the ruling Conservatives and 81 percent of them expect the opposition Labour party to win the May 1 election , according to a poll by the Institute of Management . 
the poll of 359 managers conducted during the last week showed sixty-four percent said their total overall personal tax burden had increased over the past five years . 
&quot; On the key election issue of tax , managers are particularly disillusioned with the government , &quot; the Institute said . 
&quot; respondents say lower levels of income tax have failed to deliver any real benefits to them . 
only 37 percent of managers said their organisations had started planning for political change as a result of a Labour win . 
managers &apos; support for the ruling Conservatives had edged up to 43 percent from 42 percent the previous week but was still well down on 62 percent at the 1992 election . 
support for Labour dipped to 22 percent from 24 percent the previous week but was well up on the 13 percent figure seen at the last election . 
&quot; The findings show managers &apos; bets seem to be riding on Tony Blair , &quot; Institute of Management director-general Roger Young said . 
&quot; Government policies on taxes have failed to deliver the elusive feelgood factor and the odds are that the Tories will be pipped at the post . 
other points from the poll included : 
- 63 percent of managers said income tax cuts had not increased their disposable income after essential commitments ; 
- 70 percent said they now spent more of their disposable income on essential services such as education , health care and pensions .
