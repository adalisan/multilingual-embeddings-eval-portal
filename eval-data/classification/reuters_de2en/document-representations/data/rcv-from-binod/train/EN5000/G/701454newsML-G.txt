Russia &apos;s top court sentenced a former Russian company manager to 10 years &apos; hard labour and confiscated his property on Wednesday for spying for Britain . 
a court official said Vadim Sintsov , 62 , who was arrested in January 1994 , pleaded guilty to providing British agents with information on the Russian arms industry . 
the trial was conducted by the military bench of the Supreme Court , whose rulings are final and cannot be appealed . 
the official said Sintsov , had been given a much lighter sentence than the maximum 20 years for &quot; cooperating with the court &quot; . 
Sintsov &apos;s lawyer praised the verdict , telling Russian Television : &quot; The court was not only objective but ideal . 
the case was conducted on the highest judicial level . 
Sintsov , in what appeared to be archive footage , was shown by the same channel saying : &quot; They ( the British ) were interested in real-time information -- on the current state of deliveries and also in possible samples of new Russian military equipment .
