candidates backed by parties in Italy &apos;s centre-left government won the lion &apos;s share of run-off ballots on Sunday in elections for mayor in 10 Italian towns and cities , according to official returns on Monday . 
olive Tree bloc candidates won eight of the races , with the other two won by politicians linked to the opposition centre-right Freedom Alliance . 
a Freedom Alliance candidate also won the contest for the presidency of the provincial assembly of the northeast province of Trieste , according to the returns . 
the run-offs followed the failure of candidates two weeks ago to win the required absolute majority on a first ballot . 
the elections provided a minor test of the popularity of Prime Minister Romano Prodi &apos;s centre-left Olive Tree coalition , which took office in May . 
two opinion polls published on Monday showed mixed findings about Prodi &apos;s standing though both illustrated public resentment at a &quot; Euro-tax &quot; the government plans to levy in the 1997 budget to help Italy join Europe &apos;s planned single currency . 
a Unicab research institute poll for La Repubblica newspaper said Prodi &apos;s positive rating had fallen to 42.7 percent in the survey carried out from November 22 to 24 from 55.3 percent in a similar study on October 4 and 5 . 
an explorer poll in La Stampa showed Prodi &apos;s approval rating rising by one point to 54 percent over the past month . 
in the explorer poll , 56.7 percent said the Euro-tax was unjust . 
in the Unicab survey , 50.3 percent said they did not believe the 1997 budget would help resolve Italy &apos;s economic problems .
