the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) is looking beyond North America regarding its copper futures contract , and has recently implemented moves to develop overseas , John Moore , chairman of NYMEX &apos;s COMEX division said . 
&quot; We believe that we can service the copper industry beyond the North American market , &quot; Moore said at Metal Bulletin &apos;s 10th International copper Conference . 
at present , NYMEX is a critical pricing mechanism in North America , not only for copper , but also for scrap , concentrates and blister products as well . 
last Thursday , NYMEX approved rules whereby its copper can be delivered outside the U.S. 
this rule does not specify any particular region , he added . 
the exchange is also spreading the scope of its Access after-hours screen trading system , which operates for 16 hours daily . 
currently , the facility is available in Europe and in Australia , via an arrangement with the Sydney futures Exchange . 
&quot; That facility will be extended to traders in Hong Kong very soon - probably early next month , &quot; Moore added . 
although NYMEX was being written off in some quarters two years ago when the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) opened U.S. delivery warehouses for copper , the market remains vibrant because of its price discovery capabilities . 
it is the world &apos;s largest physical commodity exchange , trading energy and precious metals as well , and has recently received a double &quot; A &quot; rating from Standard and Poors , he said .
