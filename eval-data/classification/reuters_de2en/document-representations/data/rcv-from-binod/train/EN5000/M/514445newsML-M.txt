the dollar may have stalled against the yen this week after hitting a 56-month high last Thursday , but this seems to be because the market is unhappy about the pace of the dollar &apos;s recent rally and not its level . 
the term &quot; intervention fears &quot; has been cited regularly by traders and analysts as a reason for dollar / yen &apos;s halt . 
but many say that although the market has not dismissed the possibility of Bank of Japan dollar-selling intervention as a myth , this is not the main factor capping the U.S. currency . 
&quot; The ( dollar &apos;s ) coming off is actually due to the pace of the move rather than unhappiness with the underlying direction ... 
it &apos;s just that there &apos;s been a very rapid dollar appreciation , &quot; said Eric Fishwick , international economist at Nikko Europe . 
dollar / yen posted a fresh multi-year high nearly every day last week , with the U.S. currency benefiting from the healthiness of America &apos;s economy and expectations of higher interest rates there . 
this took the dollar to a peak of 127.19 yen last Thursday , before it subsided to 125.60 in European afternoon trade by Wednesday . 
senior Japanese officials have become increasingly vociferous in their warnings about &quot; excessive moves &quot; in currency markets and of central bank intervention . 
Eisuke Sakakibara , head of the Japanese finance ministry &apos;s international finance bureau , said in a speech to currency dealers on Wednesday that the yen &apos;s recent moves were clearly excessive and that Japan would intervene when &quot; we think we can win &quot; . 
while such comments have often served to dent the dollar slightly as they did on Wednesday , analysts say economic fundamentals favour the dollar so much that intervention , verbal or otherwise , would not be able to rein in the bulls for long . 
&quot; Ultimately the market will test the resolve of the Bank of Japan because fundamentals still argue for the dollar to go higher . 
but the market &apos;s not going to do that without new factors which would cause it to test them , &quot; said Paul Lambert , senior currency economist at UBS here . 
dealers said there was little appetite to test the BOJ &apos;s resolve so close to an informal G7 finance ministers &apos; meeting at the end of this month . 
the basics for dollar strength are still in place , analysts said , notably the huge gap between yields to be gleaned from U.S. and Japanese assets . 
while 10-year U.S. Treasury notes have a yield of 6.89 percent , their Japanese counterparts have 2.15 . 
however , the market is unable to shake off the niggling feeling that the dollar may have come too far too fast . 
&quot; There does seem to have been a tendency for the market to get carried away by the yield gap factor ... and there &apos;s the feeling Japanese government bond yields have dropped too far , &quot; said Junpei Yamamoto , head of foreign exchange at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in London . 
analysts acknowledge the truth in Japanese officials &apos; verbal intervention , for example , Sakakibara &apos;s comment that the market is too pessimistic about the Japanese economy which he described on Wednesday as being very healthy . 
&quot; Sakakibara can &apos;t say rates will go up without upsetting the markets , but he is saying the market should think about the future course of the economy , &quot; said Roger Francis , senior analyst at IBJ International . 
regarding intervention , some said although there was the possibility of classic intervention in which the Bank of Japan would meet the market head-on as it drives the dollar higher , the BOJ might push the dollar down by choosing a moment when the currency was falling and add momentum with its own sales . 
&quot; You can interpret his ( Sakakibara &apos;s ) comment as saying that is what they plan to do , &quot; BOT-Mitsubishi &apos;s Yamamoto said . 
&quot; For example , if there &apos;s data showing the US-Japan trade gap has widened , that would bring dollar / yen down and there &apos;s a possibility the BOJ would sell into that , &quot; he said . 
heightened tension over Japan &apos;s politically sensitive trade surplus with the U.S. is seen as a dollar / yen-negative factor , especially if it continues to widen as many expect . 
Japan is due to announce March trade data on Wednesday . 
the U.S. will release its February trade figures on Thursday .
