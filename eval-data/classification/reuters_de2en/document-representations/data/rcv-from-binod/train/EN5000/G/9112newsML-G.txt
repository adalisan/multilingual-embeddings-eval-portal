Russian security chief Alexander Lebed signed a deal with separatists in Chechnya on Thursday , promising to withdraw government forces to end three weeks of bloodshed in Grozny , the Chechen capital . 
&quot; troops will be withdrawn from Grozny because constitutional order cannot be introduced using air and artillery strikes . 
they will be withdrawn from the whole of Chechnya , &quot; a triumphant Lebed told reporters in this village about 20 kms ( 12 miles ) south of Grozny . 
Moscow &apos;s forces have been attacking Grozny to try to oust rebels who seized it in a raid on August 6 that humiliated the Russian military . 
the separatists said the attack was in retaliation for Russian bombardments of Chechen villages . 
the Russian attacks followed a deal with the rebels for disarmament in return for step-by-step troop withdrawals from the mainly Moslem region to be completed by September 1 . 
truces have come and gone in 20 months of the Chechen conflict , and it was too soon to say whether the new deal would bring respite for civilians who have been fleeing Grozny in tens of thousands since the raid began . 
it was also unclear how much power Lebed actually wields . 
though President Boris Yeltsin appointed him his special envoy to Chechnya , Security Council secretary and security adviser , he criticised him in an interview earlier on Wednesday . 
&quot; I am not completely satisfied with Lebed &apos;s performance in Chechnya , &quot; Yeltsin told Ria news agency in an interview shown in a television feed . 
Lebed predicted further criticism from his many opponents in Moscow -- democrats and hardliners alike . 
but he seemed not to care , saying : &quot; Anyone who is unhappy is welcome to complain . 
the exact text of the deal , signed by two of the more compromising figures on the two sides , was not available . 
but Itar-Tass news agency said it provided for disengagement of Russian and rebel forces battling for 20 months in Chechnya and Lebed provided some pointers as he spoke amid a crowd of about 100 reporters , bodyguards and onlookers . 
&quot; Joint military administrations will be set up in Grozny to protect the city from looters and bandits , &quot; Lebed said . 
&quot; I will come back with a draft political agreement in two days . 
we will discuss it and sign it , &quot; he added . 
that deal would also address the root of the fighting -- Chechnya &apos;s status . 
Lebed said forces would start withdrawing tomorrow from southern Chechnya and joint military administrations would be set up at the same time . 
a deadline for a Russian assault on Grozny had passed quietly on Thursday morning as Lebed held a second day of talks . 
Interfax news agency the two sides were discussing a nine-point deal which addressed the situation in Grozny , separating the fighters , stopping looting and averting clashes . 
Lebed &apos;s press spokesman Alexander Barkhatov told reporters the two sides were working out a &quot; day-by-day schedule &quot; to stop the fighting . 
Yeltsin appointed Lebed his security chief after the former paratrooper captured around 15 percent of the votes in the first round of Russia &apos;s presidential election this year . 
but he criticised him after the talks began but before the deal was signed , saying : &quot; We must remember , when he met voters he always promised to solve the Chechen problem if he had power . 
now he has power . 
but unfortunately the results of his work are not yet obvious . 
&quot; But we must not despair , we will take this issue to the end , &quot; Yeltsin added . 
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the breakaway North Caucasus region since Yeltsin sent in his forces in December 1994 to end an independence drive . 
the latest battles have killed many hundreds and sent tens of thousands fleeing . 
expectations that Grozny would be bombed on Thursday , after a Russian commander issued an ultimatum to rebels who have seized the city , sparked a fresh exodus .
