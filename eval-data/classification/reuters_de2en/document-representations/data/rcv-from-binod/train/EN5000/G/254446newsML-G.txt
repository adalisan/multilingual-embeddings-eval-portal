South African President Nelson Mandela announced on Friday he had agreed to extend by five months the deadline for amnesty applications under a post-apartheid reconciliation programme . 
Mandela &apos;s statement said offenders would be allowed to apply for amnesty by May 10 , 1997 -- the third anniversary of his inauguration as South Africa &apos;s first black president . 
the president said in a statement read by spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe he had agreed to set May 10 , 1994 , as the cut-off date for abuses which could qualify for amnesty . 
&quot; This is one of the most difficult decisions I have had to take . 
much pain and suffering has been wrought on families , communities and the nation as a whole by acts of the nature for which amnesty is to be requested and possibly granted , &quot; Mandela said . 
&quot; But I have decided to take this decision , because on balance I am persuaded that it will further consolidate nation-building and reconciliation in a manner that is all-inclusive . 
apartheid &apos;s foes and defenders had been given until midnight on Saturday to apply for amnesty for crimes committed with a political motive before December 6 , 1993 . 
&quot; ... I have in the past week listened carefully to Bishop Desmond Tutu and General Constand Viljoen and reflected intensely on their arguments , &quot; Mandela said in the statement after talks with officials of Tutu &apos;s &quot; truth commission &quot; , which has to consider the pardons , and white conservative Freedom Front leader Viljoen . 
Mandela said his government did not want to &quot; send out a wrong message about the preparedness ... to deal firmly with criminal actions under whatever guise and from whatever quarter &quot; . 
Tutu had argued for the cut-off date to be moved , saying this would make the process more inclusive . 
Viljoen also asked for the extensions so amnesty could be considered for right-wingers who carried out a bombing spree in the run-up to the April 1994 all-race elections and others who plotted a coup at the time to derail democracy . 
Mandela said he had deferred to the wisdom and good faith of Tutu and Viljoen . 
&quot; I fully respect the integrity of both these leaders and I am of the firm view that their request for an extension of both these dates is motivated by the desire for a process of reconciliation that is as inclusive as possible . 
he also called on all those who had not yet applied to do so &quot; to unearth the truth , to bring succour to the victims and to promote justice in our new and democratic South Africa &quot; .
