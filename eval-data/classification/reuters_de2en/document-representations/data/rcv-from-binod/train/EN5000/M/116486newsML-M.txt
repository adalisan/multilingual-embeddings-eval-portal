LME copper ended Tuesday with muted gains after strength to attack overhead barriers evaporated . 
as prices approached the key $ 1,970 per tonne level on the first afternoon ring , selling came in , stalling the advance at $ 1,968 , as profit-taking and producer selling overwhelmed buyers , dealers said . 
it was disappointing that the market could not even stay above the $ 1,950 level , ending only $ 11 higher at $ 1,945 , they added . 
the market has been wary of the recent LME stocks falls , including Tuesday &apos;s 10,950-tonne decline , since many believe tonnage is not destined for end users . 
many say it is ending up in bonded Chinese warehouses , where is liable to be re-expored . 
&quot; switching stock from one hand to another by sleight of hand , however , deftly done , unfortunately does not make it disappear , &quot; said Nick Moore of Flemings Global Mining Group . 
&quot; We continue to counsel a risk averse stance towards copper , preferring exposure to aluminium , nickel and zinc , &quot; he added in a commentary . 
aluminium broke through several layers of resistance as influential short-covering hit the market , but eased off its afternoon high of $ 1,363 . 
last business on the kerb was at $ 1,356 , a healthy $ 30 gain from Monday . 
but some technical analysts have been cautious , saying a bounce was expected after the market dived into oversold territory when touching $ 1,305 recently , adding that charts look vulnerable to a solid test of the $ 1,300 level in the near future . 
lead recovered from its slide to seven-month lows of $ 735 on Monday , ending the kerb at $ 750 , up $ 12 . 
resistance is pegged at $ 760 / 1 . 
tin also finished the day stronger at $ 6,000 , up from $ 5,975 on Monday , but off its high of $ 6,015 . 
nickel ended unchanged at $ 7,120 after exploring within a range of $ 7,155 to $ 7,100 . 
zinc gained $ 7 to $ 1,022 , just on the cusp of resistance . 
Alloy closed $ 30 higher after Monday &apos;s $ 1,200 .
