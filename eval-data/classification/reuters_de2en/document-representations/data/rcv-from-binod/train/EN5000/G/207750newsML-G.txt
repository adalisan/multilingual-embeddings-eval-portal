the gasoline additive MTBE turned up in urban stormwater samples in 16 U.S. cities , but the levels were not high enough to be a health hazard in drinking water , the U.S. Geological Survey said Thursday . 
&quot; All detections of MTBE ( methyl tertiary butyl ether ) were less than the lower limit of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency &apos;s draft lifetime health advisory for drinking water , &quot; USGS said . 
MTBE , which is added to gasoline to help reduce carbon monoxide emissions , was found in one or more stormwater samples in Atlanta , baton Rouge , Birmingham , Colorado springs , Denver , Dallas / Fort worth , San Antonio and Phoenix . 
only in three of the cities -- Denver , Phoenix , and Colorado springs -- was MTBE required to be used to reduce carbon monoxide and curb smog . 
in a separate study , USGS found low concentrations of MTBE in 24 percent of groundwater samples taken from wells in New England in a separate study . 
most of those wells were near gasoline stations in Connecticut and Massachusetts . 
the findings , due to be released at a toxicology conference in Washington Thursday , were part of an Interagency study on the effectiveness of the federal oxygenated fuel program . 
EPA asked for the assessment after public complaints from some drivers that they were suffering from headaches , nausea and other symptoms and losses in fuel economy which they blamed on winter use of gasoline with MTBE .
