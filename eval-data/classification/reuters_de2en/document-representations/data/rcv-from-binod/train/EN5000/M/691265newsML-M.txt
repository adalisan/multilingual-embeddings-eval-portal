the Portuguese escudo was trading flat against the German mark but some traders said that the currency had the potential to gain a little ground on Thursday after a senior Bundesbank official said a future German rate cut could not be totally excluded . 
the escudo was at 100.94 / 97 against its closing 100.93 / 96 on Wednesday . 
but any eventual gains were likely to be only slight , they said . 
most traders saw the currency not straying far from 101.00 to the mark . 
the traders were referring to remarks by Bundesbank board member Reimut Jochimsen who said that a further German rate cut could not be ruled out although he did not see one .
