several hundred Georgians in Joseph Stalin &apos;s hometown celebrated the anniversary of the Soviet dictator &apos;s birth on Saturday with a parade and baptism of his great-great grandson . 
Stalin , born Iosif Dzhugashvili on December 21 , 1879 , grew up in Gori and attended seminary school there before continuing his spiritual training in Tbilisi , the Georgian capital 80 km ( 50 miles ) to the southeast . 
Stalin &apos;s descendants , including his grandson , attended the baptism of his two-year-old great-great grandson , also named Iosif Dzhugashvili , in the rural , pictureseque Aten Cathedral , said to be a favourite of the Soviet leader . 
several hundred people , some bearing pictures of Stalin and Soviet flags , marched down Gori &apos;s main street to the city &apos;s Stalin museum , and stopped in front of a large statue of the native son , one of the few public tributes to the leader still displayed in the former Soviet Union . 
Stalin died in 1953 after unleashing a campaign of repression that killed an estimated 20 million people and leading the country to victory over Nazi Germany .
