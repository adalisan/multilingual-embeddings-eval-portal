a group of 150 U.S. soldiers left the Fort bliss army base in Texas on Thursday to man Patriot anti-missile batteries being deployed in the Gulf as U.S. forces prepared military strikes on Iraq . 
defence officials said the soldiers were part of the Air Defence Artillery Brigade and would be responsible for manning two Patriot anti-missile batteries also being deployed to the Gulf region . 
patriot missiles were used during the 1991 Gulf War as defence against Iraqi Scud missiles . 
defence officials in Washington , asking not to be identified , said the two Patriot batteries would go to Saudi Arabia . 
earlier on Thursday , eight U.S. F-117A &quot; stealth &quot; fighters took off for the Gulf from the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico to strengthen the U.S. attack forces being assembled . 
Fort bliss spokesman Tom Collins said the deployment of the Patriot batteries and the 150 men was ordered on Wednesday after Iraq fired missiles at U.S. jets . 
another three missiles were fired by Iraqi forces on Thursday but the Pentagon said they went nowhere near Western warplanes patrolling the skies .
