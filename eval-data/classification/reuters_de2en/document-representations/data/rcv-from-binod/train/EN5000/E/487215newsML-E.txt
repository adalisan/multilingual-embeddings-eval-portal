Russian gross domestic product calculations for January and February reflect increased weighting given to the unofficial underground economy , a State Statistics Committee official said on Friday . 
Vladimir Sokolin , Deputy Chairman of the committee , told a news conference an overall review of economic indicators going back as far as 1990 was possible . 
he said that by the end of last year the shadow economy , which includes street vendors and entrepreneurs with unregistered businesses among others , accounted for around 23 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) . 
the shadow economy had accounted for about 20 percent of earlier calculations . 
&quot; It &apos;s very possible that it will increase to 25 percent , &quot; Sokolin said . 
he said 1996 committee figures did not reflect what he said was a reversal in the downward trend of the Russian economy which started in the second half of last year . 
&quot; There will definitely be a review of both 1996 and 1997 figures , &quot; Solokin said , adding that work on the review would begin in April . 
he said a more in-depth revision of methodology to be completed by the end of 1997 could lead to a further overhaul of economic statistics going back to 1990 . 
but Sokolin denied accusations the committee had changed its methodology . 
he said the dynamics of the economy had changed . 
&quot; If you &apos;re observing a family that last year had one child and this year has another child you can &apos;t really say that statistics changed the family , &quot; said Sokolin .
