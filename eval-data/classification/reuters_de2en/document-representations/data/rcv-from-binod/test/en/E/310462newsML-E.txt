South Korea &apos;s Ministry of Finance and Economy said on Wednesday it would seek to cut the current account deficit to $ 14- $ 16 billion for 1997 from an estimated $ 23 billion last year . 
the central Bank of Korea had said in November the current account deficit would narrow to about $ 18 billion in 1997 from an estimated $ 22 billion in 1996 . 
the deficit was $ 8.95 billion in 1995 . 
the ministry said it would step up an energy conservation campaign to help reduce the deficit . 
&quot; Energy imports rose by $ 5.7 billion in 1996 to $ 24.4 billion , &quot; the ministry said in a statement . 
plunging international prices for South Korea &apos;s major exports , including semiconductors , are mainly to blame for the size of the deficit .
