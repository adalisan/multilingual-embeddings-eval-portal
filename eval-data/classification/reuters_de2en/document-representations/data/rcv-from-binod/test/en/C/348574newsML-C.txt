Queensland metals Corp Ltd said on Friday lower magnesia prices and volumes are likely to result in its financial results for 1996 / 97 ( July-June ) being less than previously forecast . 
Queensland metals in November said it expected to record a modest loss . 
the company posted a net loss of A $ 8.33 million for the year ended June 30 , 1996 compared with a A $ 18.76 million loss in the previous year . 
annual negotiations with European customers were completed during the December quarter , with demand in line with 1996 , the company said . 
however , increases in supplies of magnesia resulted in strong competition between producers , Queensland metals said . 
&quot; As a result , prices will be lower in 1997 , &quot; it said . 
in light of these negotiations , Queensland metals said its outlook for 1997 is for increased sales tonnage at lower prices . 
&quot; The lower magnesia pries and less-than-budgeted volumes are expected to lead to below-forecast financial results being achieved for the 1997 financial year , &quot; the company said .
