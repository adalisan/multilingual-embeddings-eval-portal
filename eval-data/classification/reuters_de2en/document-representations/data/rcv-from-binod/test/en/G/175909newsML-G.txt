United Nations military observers in Tajikistan said on Friday they were &quot; gravely disturbed &quot; by a flare-up in fighting between government forces and guerrillas from the Islamist opposition . 
&quot; UNMOT is gravely disturbed by recent ceasefire violations in the Karategin Valley and the Tavildara area , &quot; said a statement issued to reporters in the capital Dushanbe by UNMOT ( United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan ) . 
the fighting in the former Soviet republic contravenes a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire reconfirmed in July , but regularly flouted since then . 
the statement said the U.N. special representative to Tajikistan , Gerd Merrem , had written to both the government and the opposition saying the fighting violated the ceasefire . 
&quot; According to information available , opposition forces attacked and captured Kalai-Khussein on 30 October , subsequently also capturing Sagirdasht , &quot; the statement said . 
Sagirdasht , situated in the Tavildara region 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of the Tajik capital Dushanbe , is strategically important because it has facilities for helicopters to land troops and supplies in the remote , mountainous area . 
the region straddles the only road between government- controlled territory in the west of the impoverished Central Asian country and the mountainous eastern half , which is largely controlled by opposition guerrillas . 
the four-year civil war between the government and opposition guerrillas has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced many more . 
thousands of refugees live in dust-blown camps across the border in neighbouring Afghanistan . 
the Tajik defence ministry &apos;s press service said sporadic fighting in the Tavildara region continued on Friday . 
but a spokesman for UNMOT told Reuters its observers managed to obtain the release of 26 government soldiers in the town of Komsomolabad . 
the soldiers had been captured by the opposition in recent fighting .
