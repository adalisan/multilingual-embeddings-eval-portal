the Vietnamese government said on Tuesday it had scrapped a tax on money and gifts sent from overseas following a sharp drop over the past year in remittances going via the national banking system . 
state-controlled dailies said the cancellation had been agreed to by a National Assembly committee last week that also raised the threshold for tax on personal incomes to two million Dong per month ( $ 179 ) from 1.2 million ( $ 107 ) . 
the tax on remittances -- equivalent to five percent on amounts over two million Dong and applied to irregular payments -- was aimed at cashing in on the estimated $ 1.0 billion that flows into Vietnam each year from overseas Vietnamese . 
but Tuesday &apos;s newspapers quoted a National Assembly statement that conceded the policy had done more harm than good by encouraging the transfer of money and gifts into Vietnam via unofficial channels . 
&quot; ... more serious than the fall in money sent through the banks and the post office was the danger of widespread misunderstanding among overseas Vietnamese of the Vietnamese government &apos;s intentions , &quot; the statement said . 
Western bankers said the tax on remittances had been on Vietnam &apos;s statute books for some time before being applied with vigour last year , causing a drop of at least 50 percent in money being sent into Vietnam through the national banking system . 
&quot; One bank complained to me they were getting loads of remittances of less than two million Dong , &quot; said a foreign banker , referring to the limit below which payments were tax exempt . 
an estimated two million Vietnamese live overseas , most of them having fled their homeland as refugees following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 . 
Hanoi has traditionally regarded overseas Vietnamese with suspicion , but in recent years has been moving to restore relations by encouraging them to participate in the rebuilding of its poverty-stricken and war-ravaged economy .
