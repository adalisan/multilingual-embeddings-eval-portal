the British government said on Tuesday it was confident next June &apos;s transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty to China would take place successfully . 
Deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine told a meeting of Commonwealth officials that the Commonwealth had &quot; reaffirmed its interest in a successful transition for Hong Kong , and I am very confident that this will be achieved &quot; . 
&quot; China has too much to lose if Hong Kong &apos;s outstanding economic success does not continue , &quot; he added . 
Hong Kong &apos;s six million people will leave the Commonwealth , a grouping made up mainly of Britain and its former colonies and protectorates , when it becomes part of China . 
the Commonwealth officials are holding a two-day meeting in London to prepare the ground for a Commonwealth heads of government meeting next October in Edinburgh , Scotland .
