U.S. West Coast light crudes drifted down late Friday but finished higher than yesterday &apos;s levels following a report Thursday which showed lower inventories in the U.S. 
benchmark West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude , the basis for Alaska North Slope ( ANS ) oil , ended 10 cents higher after rising as much as 15 cents over . 
prices for ANS tracked the increase , ending trade at $ 23.40 / 23.60 a barrel . 
but differentials were flat at $ 1.70 below WTI , with little trade interest this week because of Christmas . 
U.S. supplies of crude oil fell 5.1 million barrels last week , according to the key industry group American Petroleum Institute . 
though the diff was $ 1.70 off February WTI , a key producer said he would accept bids for January delivery off Februay prices . 
Kern River prices stayed at $ 18.65 / 18.75 a barrel after companies lifted postings late last week . 
discounts remained 10 cents below to even with postings , traders said .
