the dollar ended almost a pfennig lower against a rejuventated German mark in Europe on Thursday after the Bundesbank issued a vocal protest against extending this year &apos;s relentless mark decline . 
the warning was sufficient to prevent the dollar breaking into a new range above its 1994 peak and may prompt a wave of profit-taking on short mark positions across the board . 
the recovery of the mark , also seen against the yen and other European currencies , was helped by sterling / mark &apos;s retreat following an expected UK interest rate rise and also by an unexpected rise in Dutch short-term interest rates . 
&quot; The Bundesbank is probably concerned about losing control over the situation if dollar / mark breaks up through the 1994 high and the timing of these comments is very important , &quot; said Joe Prendergast , head of foreign exchange strategy at CSFB . 
following the Bundesbank &apos;s regular policy-making meeting , Bundesbank president Hans Tietemyer said the central bank was watching foreign exchange developments closely and believed the dollar / mark was now &quot; in a phase in which the ( post-1995 ) correction has clearly come to an end . 
at 1515 GMT , the dollar was trading at 1.7515 / 20 marks compared with 1.7597 / 07 late on Wednesday . 
Tietmeyer also countered recent speculation against the mark on the basis of its likely replacement by a weaker currency after European monetary union . 
&quot; You can be sure that it is important for us that the mark remains a strong currency and enters the euro as a strong currency . 
Bundesbank council member Franz Christoph Zeitler also said the dollar &apos;s correction was complete and he said the bank did not want an overshoot in the other direction . 
&quot; The Bundesbank has registered its protest in the strongest terms for some time , &quot; said Mark Geddes , economist at ABN AMRO . 
&quot; While the Bundesbank comments are the most significant news of the day , a whole range of other factors have come together at the same time and make the chances of a dollar / mark break to the high 1.70 &apos;s more remote , &quot; said Geddes at ABN AMRO . 
an expected quarter-point rise in UK official interest rates prompted sales of sterling / mark by a range of market players who had been holding out for a more aggressive half-point rise in rates . 
this gave the mark a further lift , traders said . 
the Dutch central bank later surprised traders with a rise its key money rate to 3.00 percent from 2.90 , reinforcing mark gains by underlining the trough in European interest rates . 
yet another piece of U.S. economic data showed a cooling of economic activity there , meantime , and threw more cold water on speculation of another near-term U.S. interest rate rise . 
weekly jobless benefit claims surged by 40,000 in the latest week . 
the steady stream of soft data from the U.S. and changing perceptions of the European interest rate cycle is focussing the market back on the yield spread between 10-year U.S. and German bonds , traditionally an impressive leading indicator of dollar / mark movements over time . 
the yield spread is now as low as 80 basis points and is down from as high as 120 in recent months . 
&quot; The Bund / T-note spread has been crushed over the past couple of months and either the relationship with the dollar breaks down altogether or dollar / mark is in for a serious pullback , &quot; said a trader at a major German bank in London . 
traders said further evidence of official German protests at the slide in the mark were also evidenced by the timing today of a series of Bundesbank commercial orders to sell dollars for marks just above 1.75 . 
these orders were seen by many to reinforce the central bank &apos;s new official line on current foreign exchange trends .
