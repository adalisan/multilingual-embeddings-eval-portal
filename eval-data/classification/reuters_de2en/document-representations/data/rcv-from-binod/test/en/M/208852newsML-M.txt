Australian shares deflated in the afternoon to close just lower on Thursday as profit-takers pricked a record-breaking bubble formed in the morning session . 
inspired by Wall Street &apos;s seemingly charmed run of ever-higher finishes , enthusiastic buyers ensured the key indicator hurdled the 2,400 point barrier early . 
it peaked at 2,406.2 at about 10.15 a.m. ( 2345 GMT ) before the temptation to cash in on the rapid gains of the last week proved too great . 
by 4.10 p.m. ( 0510 GMT ) , the All Ordinaries index was 0.2 points lower at 2,392.5 , barely changed from Wednesday &apos;s close . 
traders said the slicing of early gains had failed to shock , given the run-up in the last week . 
&quot; There were no surprises here this afternoon , &quot; said a Sydney broker , noting that of the sectors making the early running , only the banks had managed to secure meaningful gains by day &apos;s end . 
&quot; The banks were the only sector standing at the end . 
national Australia Bank was the performer there after its profit figures , &quot; the broker said . 
traders liked what they saw and pushed its shares to a record high of A $ 14.22 . 
Westpac Banking Corp also gained ground on the day , closing seven cents higher at A $ 7.33 . 
CRA was the standout among resources , ending higher after a day of choppy , yo-yo like trade . 
major miner MIM also attracted plenty of attention , topping turnover with 23.99 million shares traded . 
brokers said institutional investor demand for the stock had been fuelled by a recent U.S. roadshow . 
rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about 11 to 10 , while about 29 percent of stocks traded remained steady .
