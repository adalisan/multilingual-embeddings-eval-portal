shares on Jordan &apos;s stock exchange rose on Wednesday to a 14-month high in moderate trade after a one-week break for the Moslem EID al-Fitr holiday . 
the official Amman Financial Market ( AFM ) index rose 0.69 percent , its fourth consecutive daily rise , to close at 157.24 points , its highest level since December 1995 . 
turnover was an average 846,000 dinars ( $ 1.2 million ) . 
&quot; The market was mainly pushed up by the blue-chip shares , &quot; said analyst Mohammad Abdallah of Pearl Investment . 
brokers said residual optimism from parliament &apos;s decision last week to abolish a punitive 15 percent tax on companies who raise capital with transfers from reserves continued to boost some companies . 
reports of fresh Jordanian contracts to supply Iraq also encouraged the market . 
Arab Bank , which is expected to issue bonus shares backed by a transfer from reserves , rose to another 12-month high of 263.50 dinars after trade worth 138,000 dinars . 
the Housing Bank , which last week announced a modest rise in 1996 profits , rose 0.15 dinars to 4.90 dinars in turnover of 170,000 dinars , making it Wednesday &apos;s busiest stock . 
Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Unified Company for Organising Land Transport , which have strengthened since the announcement of Baghdad &apos;s U.N. oil-for-food deal in December , both rose in healthy turnover . 
overall shares in 27 firms rose on Wednesday , while four fell . 
another nine were traded but closed unchanged . 
the private Pearl Index of the 45 most-traded shares on the exchange rose 1.05 percent to 82.94 points . 
but unlike the official AFM index , which has responded sharply to gains by market heavyweights Arab Bank and Jordan potash , the Pearl Index remains 13.16 percent down from its level at the end of 1995 .
