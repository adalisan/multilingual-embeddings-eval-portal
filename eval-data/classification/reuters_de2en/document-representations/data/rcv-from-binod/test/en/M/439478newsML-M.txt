the Singapore dollar ended weak but above overnight lows against the U.S. dollar on Thursday . 
a switch by investors out of the Singapore dollar and into the Malaysian ringgit left the cross rate between the two currencies near to a two-and-a-half year high , dealers said . 
after trading in a 30-point range all day , dollar / sing was quoted at 1.4335 / 45 in late Asian trade against its London high of 1.4363 . 
the ringgit / sing cross was at 57.87 / 94 Singapore cents after briefly climbing above the 58 cents barrier during the day . 
dealers said much of the Singapore dollar &apos;s weakness was due to continued fund flows into the higher yielding ringgit , but Singapore &apos;s release of weak industrial production data and tensions in ties with its neighbour were also cited as factors . 
a European bank dealer said the sing dollar &apos;s overnight drop had been exaggerated by stop-loss orders in a thin market . 
&quot; Today , we were still trading a range of 1.4325-1.4360 . 
not very much action , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Basically , everybody is so bullish on dollar / sing . 
they &apos;re taking any piece of information to buy , &quot; he added . 
dealers said Singapore &apos;s announcement on Wednesday of a sharp 7.2 percent year-on-year drop in January manufacturing output provided the market with such an excuse . 
Alison Seng , analyst with mms Standard and Poor &apos;s , said there was some initial selling of the Singapore dollar in early trade on news reports that Malaysia was seeking an apology for Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew &apos;s description of a Malaysian state as &quot; notorious &quot; in a January 27 court affidavit . 
&quot; We saw some buying of the U.S. dollar on this in the morning . 
it was a pretty short-lived knee-jerk reaction but the other factors like the ringgit / sing play and the industrial output also contributed to the slight biddish tone in dollar / sing , &quot; Seng said . 
she said the U.S. dollar was likely to struggle in a 1.4325-1.4360 range for a while as players would seek to sell it near its highs . 
&quot; If ringgit / sing cannot break 58 cents , that won &apos;t be very good for dollar / sing , &quot; she added .
