CSCE coffee futures settled mostly lower on Friday , pressured by an afternoon round of speculative selling amid news a six-day truckers &apos; strike in Colombia was called off , traders said . 
&quot; They settled the strike in Colombia , &quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walt Spilka , &quot; so , the market &apos;s giving back some of what it has gained on that news . 
prices ping-ponged on both sides of unchanged throughout the day , with the July , September and December 1997 contracts setting new life-of-contract highs during the session before the late-session sell-off . 
after hitting a fresh high of 203.50 cents per lb , most-active July futures closed at down 4.95 cents , at 193.25 cents , just off the session low of 192.50 cents . 
spot May finished down 3.40 , to 216.35 , while the outer months ended 4.30 lower to 6.00 higher . 
coffee prices headed lower at the outset , after a weak showing overnight in the London robusta market . 
but the New York market managed to bounce off key support levels , inspiring a bout of chart-driven buying . 
traders said July &apos;s breach of $ 2 per pound -- a crucial psychological level -- triggered technical buy orders . 
July quickly reached a new contract high of 203.50 cents , before some speculative profit-taking cut into gains , they said . 
some analysts said news late Friday that Colombia &apos;s main truck drivers &apos; union agreed to end the work stoppage is likely to be a temporary setback . 
with arabica inventories near historically low levels in the U.S. , and uncertainty about the size of many Latin American crops , they said the futures market remained well supported . 
&quot; The end of the Colombia strike really should not matter , &quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes . 
&quot; There are so many other bullish fundamental factors . 
the nearby May / July switch , a barometer of nearby availability , widened to 23.10 today from 21.55 at the close on Thursday . 
after Friday &apos;s close , the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks fell 1,747 60-kg bags , to 48,603 bags as of April 24 . 
there were 3,815 bags of coffee pending grading , the exchange said . 
the day &apos;s volume was moderate , at an estimated 8,224 lots .
