quiet trading ushered Shenzhen &apos;s B share index to a slightly higher close on Friday , with investors fearing sharp rises could provoke new government anti-speculation measures , brokers said . 
&quot; The markets have been so volatile lately and no one wants to bet on the government &apos;s next move , &quot; a trader at China Southern Securities said . 
Beijing &apos;s measures to cool the markets at the start of May and rumours of further moves sent A and B share indices into a tailspin . 
before the crackdown , they had surged more than 50 percent from the beginning of 1997 . 
&quot; Unless the government comes out with hard-hitting measures over the weekend , Monday is not going to be very exciting either , &quot; an analyst at a foreign investment bank said . 
the A share index gained 10.57 points or 2.44 percent to 443.91 on light turnover of 5.4 billion yuan , against Thursday &apos;s 5.7 billion . 
among the A shares , Shenzhen Development Bank , which has been under investigation for stock trading misconduct , was the most actively traded at 38.5 million shares . 
the stock gained 0.59 yuan to 33.64 yuan . 
several Hong Kong newspapers have reported rumours that there may be top personnel changes at the bank because of the probe . 
Bank officials declined to comment .
