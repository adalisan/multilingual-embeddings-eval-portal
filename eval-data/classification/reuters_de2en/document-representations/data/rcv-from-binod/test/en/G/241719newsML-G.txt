a Chinese court has jailed a 56-year-old dissident for five years for subversion , dealing another blow to the country &apos;s tiny , struggling democracy movement . 
the Intermediate People &apos;s Court in XI &apos;an city , in the northern province of Shaanxi , convicted Zhang Zong &apos;ai this week of spreading &quot; counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement &quot; , his lawyer , Zhang Jiankang , said on Saturday . 
the dissident , detained since June , has appealed to the Shaanxi provincial Higher People &apos;s Court , the Hong Kong-based Human Rights and Democracy in China Information Centre said . 
&quot; Their ( Chinese authorities ) intention is to kill the chicken for the monkey to see ... to frighten other dissidents , &quot; a spokesman for the centre , which monitors human rights abuses in China , said in a telephone interview . 
Zhang was previously jailed for five years for demanding Premier Li Peng be impeached for ordering the military to crush student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centred in Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square in June 1989 , the human rights watchdog said . 
he lost his seat in the local lawmaking body along with his teaching job at the XI &apos;an Institute of Statistics and his wife divorced him after his incarceration in 1989 , his family said . 
asked to comment on Zhang &apos;s latest conviction , his sister , Zhang Xin , said he was innocent . 
&quot; He was wrongly accused , &quot; the sister said by telephone . 
&quot; He didn &apos;t commit any crime ... 
he didn &apos;t do anything . 
his lawyer told Reuters the court had found Zhang guilty of attacking China &apos;s judiciary in an interview with former student leader Wang Dan that was later published in a Hong Kong newspaper . 
Wang , a former student leader of the 1989 democracy demonstrations , was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month for conspiring to subvert the government . 
the court also found Zhang guilty of signing a petition last year urging authorities to show political tolerance , the lawyer said . 
the court cleared Zhang of any wrongdoing in accepting money from an overseas group , the lawyer said . 
the court ruled Zhang did accept money but that he did not use the funds for counter-revolutionary activities . 
the lawyer said the verdict also did not mention a charge in the bill of indictment that accused Zhang of &quot; pledging loyalty &quot; to the Taiwan authorities by writing to General Wego Chiang . 
Chiang is the sole surviving son of the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek , who fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949 . 
China regards Taiwan as a rebel province . 
the dissident had not mailed a letter to Chiang that was found in his home in XI &apos;an . 
Beijing &apos;s Communists and Taipei &apos;s Nationalists have been political rivals for almost five decades . 
in recent months , the Chinese authorities have dealt crushing blows to the struggling democracy movement . 
most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps . 
China dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs . 
three pro-democracy activists are currently standing trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement in Hefei , capital of the central province of Anhui . 
in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen that neighbours Hong Kong , two labour activists are standing trial for conspiring to subvert the government .
