London stocks stormed to a record on Thursday as the weaker pound boosted prospects for exporters and Paris hit a fresh peak , led higher by strength in financial shares . 
sterling took a pounding overnight in Asia as a big sell-off dragged it sharply lower from Wednesday &apos;s 52-month record against the mark . 
the decline was caused by growing expectations that British interest rates would not be increased . 
the dollar , however , remained close to its 2-1 / 2 year high against the mark . 
as London stormed ahead , other major European bourses recovered from early losses . 
Paris touched a new intraday peak and Frankfurt again nudged record levels , helped by the stronger dollar which was seen as good for exporting sectors . 
in London , Europe &apos;s biggest bourse , the FTSE 100 index soared nearly one percent to an intra-day peak of 4,254.6 , surpassing the record of 4,227.5 set during trading on Wednesday . 
growing hopes that British interest rates would remain unchanged eroded the pound &apos;s recent strength , taking the pressure off overseas earners and exporters . 
&quot; The currency is having a major impact , &quot; said the head of equity trading at one top brokerage . 
investors shrugged off a weak close on Wall Street and were encouraged by major oils stocks , which benefit from a strong dollar , and British Steel , recently subject to savage earnings downgrades because of sterling &apos;s strength . 
&quot; After all the downgrades we have seen on currency strength , we could even see forecasts being nudged back up again if sterling continues to retreat , &quot; said one dealer . 
sterling &apos;s decline comes after months of sharp gains in the currency as the prospect of rising British interest rates lured speculative cash into the currency . 
but Wednesday &apos;s weaker-than-expected British retail sales data changed currency dealers &apos; minds , suggesting British rates could be on hold until after the election due by May . 
sterling regained some poise to trade at 2.6758 marks by mid-day , but was still nearly five pfennigs below its 2.7240 high in late Europe on Wednesday . 
London &apos;s stock gains came despite a weak showing on Wall Street where the Dow ended down 33.87 points at 6,850.03 , weighed down by tumbling IBM shares after the computer giant &apos;s results were marred by a drop in profit margins . 
French shares , which hit a record close on Wednesday , also perked up after early losses to hit a new trading peak of 2,457.20 on the CAC-40 index . 
financial stocks were the stars after Societe Generale upped its 1996 profit forecast , one broker said . 
in Frankfurt , German shares fell at the start of bourse trade following the latest German money supply data which came out slightly higher than expected , scotching hopes of a quick interest rate cut . 
but the DAX share index recovered the losses to show a gain of 0.2 percent at midday , placing it withing striking distance of its all-time trading high . 
Frankfurt has benefited greatly from the stronger dollar because of the large number of exporting firms listed . 
with the main focus of the currency markets on sterling , the dollar made modest gains against the mark and yen by mid-day but some traders voiced doubts about how long its bull run would last . 
although the currency did not seem to have reached the end of its rally , it was due for a consolidation , traders said . 
sterling &apos;s plunge and the mark &apos;s recovery against other European units could prove to be an opportunity for the dollar to settle down . 
&quot; Sterling &apos;s acting as a millstone around the dollar &apos;s neck right now . 
the battering that sterling / mark got has boosted the mark relative to the dollar , &quot; said David Brown , chief economist at Bear Stearns . 
the Bundesbank &apos;s decision to keep its discount and Lombard rates unchanged after its regular council meeting came as no surprise to the market . 
the dollar surged to 119.19 yen and 1.6409 marks from Wednesday &apos;s late European levels of 118.91 and 1.6393 . 
the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 33.7 points at 4,252.8 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index was 14.09 higher at 2,456.55 . 
gold was fixed at at $ 349.80 an ounce , compared to Wednesday &apos;s close of $ 351.15 .
