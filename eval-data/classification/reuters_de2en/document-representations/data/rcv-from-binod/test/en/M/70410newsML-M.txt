brokers said the counter opened on a cautious tone after staging strong rises last week on rumours that some business tycoons may take a stake in the company . 
but it rose after a block transaction of 5 million shares in early trade . 
&quot; Active buying on Astra is likely to continue as it also has good fundamentals , &quot; said one foreign broker .
