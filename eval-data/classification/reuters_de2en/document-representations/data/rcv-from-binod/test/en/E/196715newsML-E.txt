the East Asian growth miracle is really no miracle at all but an easily-explained phenomenon that is now poised to strike in South Asia , particularly in India , world-renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs said on Monday . 
a combination of strong economic institutions with an under-developed economy explains the very rapid rates of growth seen in Asia over the last two decades , Sachs , director of the Harvard Institute for International Development , said during an address at the World Economic Forum in Hong Kong . 
and now , &quot; the great change in Asia in the last five years is definitely the opening up of India , &quot; Sachs said . 
&quot; Another one billion people are being brought into the world &apos;s economic system ... and we &apos;re only beginning to factor in the enormous implications . 
Sachs said that if India applies strong economic institutions to its under-developed economy , it can quickly generate the stellar growth rates seen in east and southeast Asia . 
&quot; Asia is on the move as never before , including South Asia , finally , &quot; Sachs said . 
&quot; India is going to find its way to fast growth and find its way back to the world economy , and it &apos;s going to play a very significant role in my view . 
in more developed Asian economies such as Singapore , growth rates are slowing . 
Singapore failed to meet forecast growth rates of seven percent and more have prompted unwarranted anxiety , Sachs said . 
&quot; Everything else being equal , poorer countries will tend to grow faster than richer because they are catching up . 
and as that catching up process ends , growth rates will slow down , &quot; Sachs said . 
&quot; I think that is probably the safest and most prudent way to view the current circumstances . 
the economies of South Korea and Taiwan should also expect to see their growth rates slow from prior torrid rates of between eight and 10 percent , he said . 
while they are quite competitive , both countries have relatively undeveloped economic infrastructure , including weak financial markets that are poorly integrated globally . 
other Southeast Asian countries , such as Indonesia , Thailand and Malaysia , can expect to continue growing quickly because their economies are still relatively under-developed . 
&quot; This doesn &apos;t mean there aren &apos;t short-term problems ... this is not a deep , structural weakness but a pause , &quot; Sachs said .
