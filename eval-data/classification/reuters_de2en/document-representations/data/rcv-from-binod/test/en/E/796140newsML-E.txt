Viktor Suslov , after barely three weeks at the helm of troubled Ukraine &apos;s economy ministry , said on Wednesday the former Soviet republic &apos;s new government would have to take painful decisions to escape economic crisis . 
&quot; The government has a lot of preparatory work to do to bring to life a package of measures , including unpopular ones , to get the economy in order and pull it out of crisis , &quot; Suslov told a news conference . 
Suslov was appointed economy minister on July 25 as part of a cabinet reshuffle which President Leonid Kuchma said was aimed at speeding up reforms . 
the International Monetary Fund has delayed a long-term loan pending more structural reforms and Ukraine is awaiting an interim , standby deal of about $ 550 million instead . 
&quot; I would like to hope that there will be a very clear shift from economic romanticism to the politics of tough economic pragmatism in the work of this government , &quot; Suslov said . 
Suslov headed parliament &apos;s finance and banking committee and reactions to his appointment among analysts were mixed . 
he speaks in favour of reforms but was allied with moderate conservatives in parliament , though he says he sought their backing only because they supported his committee appointment . 
on Wednesday he said he favoured &quot; sensible protectionism &quot; including vigilance on dumping goods in Ukraine and imposing duties where appropriate on imports to the country of 51 million . 
he gave no specific examples . 
he said he had already met Western experts including the World Bank and added : &quot; We will put their advice to use &quot; . 
Suslov confirmed that the government would press ahead with plans to cancel subsidies on communal services including rents -- a step demanded by the IMF to qualify for the multi-billion-dollar Extended Fund Facility . 
a further painful step would involve making a string of big Ukrainian enterprises bankrupt . 
&quot; I have issued an order and now a list of 30 big businesses is being prepared which firstly consume a lot of energy , secondly are technically out-of-date and thirdly have big budget debts , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The aim is very simple -- to launch bankruptcy cases in the arbitrage court , stop these businesses and sell them off . 
there is no way out . 
these are steps which should have been taken a long time ago , &quot; he added .
