defending champions Natal overcame a spirited fightback from Western Province in the final quarter to win their opening Currie Cup match of the season 34-22 ( halftime 12-8 ) at Kings Park on Sunday . 
the Natal Sharks , losing semi-finalists to eventual winners Auckland in this year &apos;s Super 12 competition , controlled much of the play and led 34-8 with 11 minutes remaining . 
sharks fullback Gavin lawless maintained a 100 percent kicking record for a tally of five penalties and a conversion before limping off early in the second half with a back injury . 
but Harry Viljoen &apos;s improving Westerm Province side , although still erratic in parts , began to string together a sequence of linking moves from their own half in the last 10 minutes . 
they ran in tries through prop Garry Pagel and right wing Andy Marinos to reduce the deficit to 12 points . 
the match was a bruising encounter and , with both sides missing key players in the springbok squad , several new combinations were looking to find their feet . 
against the run of play , Western Province opened up an 8-6 lead in the 17th minute when fullback Pieter Rossouw created an unconverted try for number eight Andrew Aitken after a powerful break down the left wing . 
but Natal fullback lawless , playing against his old team mates , kicked his third successful penalty out of three to edge his side ahead 9-8 after the first quarter . 
Natal scored their opening try of the match right from the re-start when centre Jeremy Thomson charged down a Rossouw clearance attempt to score under the posts . 
with springbok lock Mark Andrews dominating in the lineouts , Natal then scored a second try when substitute fullback Errol Stewart crossed in the right-hand corner after a jinking break by flanker and captain Wayne Fyvie . 
stung into desperation , Western Province finished the match in style with their two converted tries in the closing stages . 
on Saturday , the Gauteng Lions - despite being boosted by the return from injury of springbok internationals Hennie le Roux , Japie Mulder and Johan Roux - came close to becoming the first Super 12 casualties of the 1997 Currie Cup campaign . 
a controversial penalty try 14 minutes from time helped the fancied Lions narrowly beat a motivated Boland 35-33 in Wellington . 
down 13-20 at the break and then 25-30 with just 14 minutes remaining , the Lions were always playing catch-up rugby against an inspired Boland side . 
Le Roux , playing impressively at inside centre , initiated the fightback but the award of the controversial penalty try against Boland by Zimbabwean referee Marty wiles proved to be the turning-point in the match . 
although Boland flyhalf Pieter O &apos;Neill put his team back into the lead 33-32 with his seventh successful kick out of eight , Dawie du Toit put the Gautengers two points clear with his third penalty on the stroke of full-time . 
o &apos;Neill could have snatched a last-gasp win for Boland with the final kick of the match but his well-struck drop goal attempt shaved the left-hand upright . 
in other Currie Cup matches played on Friday night , the Gauteng falcons beat North West 39-31 ( halftime 27-11 ) in Brakpan with right wing wing Len van Riet scoring twice as his team ran in four tries for the extra bonus point . 
Northern Free State upstaged Eastern Province 31-18 ( halftime 11-13 ) in Welkom and utility back Jurie Jerling crossed the line twice as the home side outscored E.P. 
by four tries to two .
