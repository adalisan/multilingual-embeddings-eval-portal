September Japanese government bond futures rocketed shortly before the close on its last trading day on Friday , as repo rates for cash JGBs suitable for delivery were extremely high . 
some dealers reported market talk that U.S hedge funds , believed to have long positions on the September futures , were borrowing a huge amount of the cheapest cash JGBs , namely the 161st and 163rd JGBs , to boost their repo rates . 
dealers said the September contract &apos;s last-minute rise was abnormally fast , reflecting a strong need to buy back the contract , as the cheapest cash bonds were hard to come by . 
the spread between the price of the September contract and the December contract was 1.86 at Friday &apos;s close . 
dealers said normally the spread between a benchmark contract and an expiring contract is about 1.20 to 1.30 . 
there was also a rumour that hedge funds intend to take delivery of cash JGBs for the expiring September contract . 
the outstanding amount of the 161st and the 163rd JGBs was about one trillion yen each . 
one trader said the hedge funds might have borrowed about 500 billion yen worth of the 161st JGB , on top of their long position of about 150 billion yen in the 161st bonds . 
considering a certain amount is owned by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) and individual investors , they now hold a very large proportion of the 161st bonds at hand , he added . 
some dealers argued that hedge funds might have tried to increase the repo rate of the 161st and 163rd JGBs , because they wanted to receive 164th bonds . 
they said the 161st and the 163rd JGBs were quite expensive and prices are likely to fall from now on .
