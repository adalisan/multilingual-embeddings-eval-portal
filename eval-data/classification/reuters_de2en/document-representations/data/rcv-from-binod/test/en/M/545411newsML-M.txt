a dearth of interest in Kuala Lumpur shares after a month-long decline started the market on a soft note on Monday , dealers said . 
against the bearish mood , newly-listed Computer Systems Advisers , a systems integrator , had a strong debut at 8.80 ringgit against an offer price of 2.80 . 
it shot up to as high as 9.95 before settling at 9.10 at 0204 GMT . 
meanwhile , the composite Index languished at 1,083.22 , down 6.23 points . 
&quot; It might test the 1,050 level , &quot; said an institutional dealer with a local securities firm . 
&quot; I think there is a lack of participation from local and foreign funds , &quot; said the dealer , adding that margin calls on overextended accounts were adding to the market &apos;s doldrums . 
discussing Computer Systems , Ralph Dixon of TA Securities &apos; international division , said investors were eyeing the company &apos;s link to the Multimedia Super Corridor project . 
&quot; We &apos;re saying fair value is around seven ringgit , &quot; he added . 
after 45 minutes of trading , total market volume was 23 million shares , with losers outnumbering gainers by 265 to 46 .
