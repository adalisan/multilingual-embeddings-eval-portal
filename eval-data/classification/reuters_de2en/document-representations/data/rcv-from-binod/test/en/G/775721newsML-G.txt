an author known as the Salman Rushdie of Egypt for his troubles with authorities over his writing said he tried to commit suicide in a Cairo court to protest against poor prison conditions . 
Alaa Hamed , who since May has been serving a one-year prison sentence for writing a book that prosecutors said was blasphemous and sexually explicit , told Reuters he tried to kill himself with a razor during a court session on Sunday . 
he was in court to petition judges to suspend the sentence until the Court of Cassation , the highest court in Egypt , issued a final ruling on the case . 
&quot; There is nothing that a writer who is treated unjustly can do in front of a storm but to commit suicide , &quot; Hamed told Reuters . 
&quot; I am willing to spend the rest of my life in a U.S. prison , but not here . 
&quot; But I am a weak person facing strong establishments , like Al Azhar , &quot; he said , referring to the Cairo-based university and mosque which is Sunni Islam &apos;s most prestigious seat of learning and which has condemned his writing as blasphemous . 
Salman Rushdie is the British writer whose book &quot; The satanic verses &quot; was bitterly attacked by the late Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as blaspheming against Islam . 
Khomeini issued a &apos; fatwa &apos; or death edict against Rushdie in 1989 which soured relations between Iran and the European Union . 
Court sources here said Hamed had hoped the judges would suspend the sentence indefinitely but they froze it temporarily . 
Court guards restrained him after he tried to kill himself and took him to a doctor , they added . 
in May , a lower appeal court upheld the one-year prison sentence against Hamed , a former employee of the tax department , for writing the unsold &quot; El Firash &quot; ( The bed ) , a collection of short stories . 
the verdict included a 200 pound ( $ 58.9 ) fine and the seizure of copies of the book . 
Egypt &apos;s legal system allows the suspension of an appeal court sentence until the Court of Cassation studies the case . 
Hamed was fired from his job at the tax authority in 1994 by an administrative court decision over the same book . 
in 1991 , Hamed was at the centre of an international outcry when a state security court sentenced him to eight years in prison for a story questioning religion . 
the court at the time said the book , &quot; A Distance in a Man &apos;s mind , &quot; threatened national unity and peace . 
but Hamed did not serve the sentence because former prime minister Atef Sedki , in his function as Egypt &apos;s deputy martial law governor , did not endorse it . 
lawyers said the verdict , however , would remain valid for 10 years . 
intellectuals in Egypt say they are under fire from Moslem militants who want to change Egypt into their vision of a strict Islamic state and from the court system , which Islamists have used successfully to curb freedom of expression . 
last year , a group of Moslem fundamentalist lawyers brought a legal action that forced a university professor and his wife to separate on the ground that his writings had made him an apostate . 
militants killed secular writer Farag Foda in 1992 and injured Nobel Literature Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz , 83 , in 1994 .
