Linford Christie said on Tuesday that he was not excited about running anymore and confirmed his retirement as well as his desire to pursue his coaching career . 
Christie announced his retirement -- not for the first time -- on Saturday and said on Tuesday he was happy with the decision . 
&quot; I &apos;ve always said that when I would wake up one morning and not feel like competing , then that would be the time to stop , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It would have been nice to give the fans one more meeting but you &apos;ve got to quit sometime . 
the 37-year-old Briton , who attended the recently-ended Athens world championships as a television analyst , said he had not felt frustrated by not being on the track . 
Christie will now concentrate on coaching several leading athletes including Namibian Frankie Fredericks , Jamaican Merlene Ottey and Briton Jamie Baulch . 
the greatest European sprinter in history , Christie made a late start to his international career , reaching his peak with gold in the 1992 Olympics and the 1993 world championships . 
Christie collected 23 medals , including 10 golds from major championships , but his reign at the top came to an incongruous end when he was disqualified from the 100 metres final in last year &apos;s Olympics for two false starts . 
in Athens he witnessed the start of the new era with titles in the 100 and 200 metres respectively for American Maurice Greene and Trinidad &apos;s ATO Boldon , both aged 23 -- 14 years younger than Christie . 
Christie said he was slightly irritated to hear them keep talking about crushing the world record . 
&quot; They should not say that they are going to do it , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They should just go out there and surprise everybody by doing it . 
but he said he did hope the record of 9.84 seconds set by Canadian Donovan Bailey last year in Atlanta would fall . 
&quot; It would be good for the sport , it would take it to another level , &quot; he said , before naming Boldon as the type of character that athletics needed to attract attention . 
&quot; It &apos;s good to have somebody like Boldon around because he &apos;s such a great personality , &quot; he said .
