inflation remained largely quiet , and consumers turned more aggressive on trips to shopping malls and auto dealers as the year drew to a close , the government reported Tuesday . 
it said the Consumer Price Index rose a modest 0.3 percent in December while retail sales moved up a moderate 0.6 percent in new evidence suggesting the economic expansion was still healthy as it neared its sixth birthday . 
&quot; The new data is consistent with moderate economic growth and remarkably well-behaved inflation , &quot; said Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co . 
for all of 1996 , the Labour Department said consumer prices also rose moderately , although the 3.3 percent increase was the largest rise in six years . 
prices had risen 2.5 percent in 1995 . 
economists said one culprit in the increase last year was energy costs , which jumped 8.6 percent , the biggest rise since 1990 , when they rose 18.1 percent in the run-up to the Gulf War . 
energy costs rose by 1.6 percent in December alone , after being up 1.2 percent in November . 
part of the energy price rise reflected underlying global demand from both developed and developing countries as well as a brutal winter in Europe that helped draw down global energy stocks , analysts said . 
with the volatile food and energy sectors subtracted , however , the inflation picture was much more benign , even though there had been fears that wage pressures might be increasing . 
the so-called &quot; core &quot; or underlying rate rose only 0.1 percent last month after being up 0.2 percent in November . 
for all of 1996 , it rose by only 2.6 percent , the smallest rise since an identical increase in 1994 . 
it rose by 3.0 percent in 1995 . 
food and beverage prices helped to moderate inflation in December , rising only 0.1 percent after being up 0.3 percent in November . 
transportation costs rose 0.6 percent while medical care increased by 0.2 percent and entertainment by 0.4 percent . 
retail sales were boosted by Christmas as business picked up at clothing and general merchandise stores . 
total retail sales increased last month by 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 208.2 billion after a revised 0.2 percent decline in November . 
that was slightly stronger than the 0.5 percent sales gain forecast by Wall Street economists . 
previously , the Commerce Department said total November retail sales had fallen by 0.4 percent . 
but it revised that to show a smaller decline . 
&quot; Retail sales showed more strength than people anticipated , and point toward firmer growth in the fourth quarter , &quot; said Anthony Chan , chief economist at Banc One Investment advisors . 
&quot; That is underscored by strong upward revisions of overall retail sales in the prior month . 
sales of both long-lasting durable goods , like new cars , as well as non-durables such as food and clothing , rebounded in December from a November slump . 
sales of all types of durable goods rose 0.5 percent to $ 84.95 billion in December after a 0.4 percent drop in November , while sales of non-durables gained 0.7 percent to $ 123.24 billion following a 0.2 percent fall in November . 
earlier reports from major chain stores indicated that holiday sales were not as brisk as many had expected . 
&quot; It is still questionable whether momentum will continue well into 1997 , &quot; added Chan , &quot; This is called into question by weakness in this month &apos;s eating and drinking sales . 
when consumers are optimistic , they tend to eat out more . 
it &apos;s a leading indicator of future retail activity . 
but some analysts said that after pausing in the third quarter to help reduce some of their debt burden , consumers , buoyed in part by the still vibrant stock market and low unemployment , returned to their buying ways . 
&quot; The pick-up in retail sales in December argues that the fourth quarter will be fairly strong , &quot; said National Association of Manufacturers President Jerry Jasinowski . 
sales at general merchandise stores rose in December by 0.5 percent to $ 26 billion , recovering from a 0.5 percent decline during November . 
at apparel stores , sales of clothing increased 1.5 percent to $ 9.43 billion after falling 1.7 percent in November . 
sales of new cars were also stronger in December , rising 0.7 percent to $ 50.9 billion following a 1 percent drop in November . 
new cars account for about one-fifth of total retail sales , so swings in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures . 
excluding cars , retail sales still were 0.6 percent higher in December after being flat in November . 
the economic expansion will be six years old in March .
