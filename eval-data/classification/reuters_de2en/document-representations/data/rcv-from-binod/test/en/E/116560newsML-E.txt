Tanzania is on target for a World Bank loan of up to $ 100 million which could be granted by early 1997 , a World Bank official said on Tuesday . 
but World Bank Tanzania representative Ron Brigish said reports in the local media here that a Structural Adjustment Credit ( SAC ) had already been agreed were premature . 
&quot; As far as we &apos;re ( World Bank ) concerned we &apos;ll be appraising a structural adjustment credit in November and we hope we can take it to our board in early 1997 , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; We think this government is much more committed to fiscal stability than the previous one , &quot; Brigish added . 
President Benjamin Mkapa won elections last October and has pledged a commitment to reforms and reduction of corruption . 
Brigish said the World Bank was closely watching that the Tanzanian government stuck to its June budget forecasts . 
&quot; This is one of the tests . 
the government has come to agreements before with the IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) and then gone off track , &quot; said Brigish . 
Brigish said that Tanzania , one of the world &apos;s poorest , could receive between $ 80-100 million Bank financial support . 
&quot; We will be looking at a fair injection of balance of payments support which Tanzania needs , &quot; he said . 
latest statistics from the central Bank of Tanzania show the country &apos;s foreign debt as currently about $ 7.5 billion . 
following the November appraisal of the government &apos;s financial requirements , negotiations would open with the Tanzania government and a formal proposal would then be put to the board of the World Bank . 
&quot; We &apos;ll appraise in November -- we &apos;re almost there , &quot; said Brigish . 
asked to assess the current prospects of a World Bank soft loan , he said : &quot; I &apos;m fairly confident given the commitment of this government to economic reform and the leadership of President Mkapa in this respect . 
the IMF has said Tanzania could receive an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility ( ESAF ) worth $ 234 million by this month with further debt relief to follow from the Paris Club worth more than $ 200 million . 
restoration of IMF credit will trigger an estimated $ 1.2 billion in donor bilateral aid , economic experts said . 
Brigish said key areas of World Bank concern about Tanzania included a slowdown in public sector reforms including further cuts to the civil service and privatisation of parastatals . 
improvement in revenue collection and a elimination of official corruption were other areas of concern , Brigish said . 
a report of a parliamentary investigation last month said Finance Minister Simon Mbilinyi acted improperly over imports of cooking oil and should be &quot; taken to task &quot; . 
the report said Mbilinyi ignored advice from his ministry officials who said the oil should not receive tax exemption . 
President Mkapa has made no comment on the report .
