cocoa buying in Ivory Coast has dwindled ahead of the new 1996 / 97 cocoa season because of uncertainty about the start date and likely marketing price levels , exporters and buyers say . 
mould in 1995 / 96 mid-crop cocoa stored up-country was forcing down prices paid to farmers who are short of cash as they wait for a government announcement of 1996 / 97 main crop rates , one buyer there said . 
rain and a drop in temperature at the weekend have added to cocoa drying difficulties , another said . 
&quot; We are back to where we were two weeks ago when cocoa was coming out very slowly , &quot; said one San Pedro exporter , adding : &quot; It &apos;s very variable . 
the big exporters are buying practically nothing but local processors are taking deliveries . 
exporters said uncertainty about the opening date for the 1996 / 97 marketing season meant farmers would sell older stock for less than the guideline 1995 / 96 price of 315 CFA per kilo . 
&quot; We don &apos;t think the season will now open on October 15 . 
the situation is very blurred , perhaps deliberately to affect the price . 
the rumour now is of an October 23 start to the season , &quot; said the exporter in San Pedro . 
both exporters and buyers reported limited buying and export activity as farmers were storing main crop in the hope of a price increase in the next couple of weeks . 
&quot; Old cocoa can be bought for less in some areas but new crop is still fetching 315 CFA ( per kilo ) , &quot; one up-country buyer said . 
&quot; There is a mold problem so farmers will be selling older crop at a discount . 
others say this is already happening . 
ivory Coast usually opens its marketing season in early October but this year it was set for October 15 . 
exporters in Abidjan and San Pedro said cocoa arrivals were sporadic and bound for local factories rather than export . 
exporters and buyers want an increase in their 1996 / 97 marketing rates citing petrol price rises and other inflationary pressures . 
cocoa prices paid to producers are expected to remain stable when they are finally set this month . 
industry sources expect a rise , if any , of between three and 10 percent , giving a maximum price of 350 CFA per kilo . 
one buyer in Gagnoa said farmers were getting advances for coffee to cover school fees . 
&quot; We are storing coffee until the end of the year with their ( farmers &apos; ) names on the bags and paying partly in advance to help them pay for school fees , &quot; she said , denying rumours that some farmers around nearby Issia were being paid only 200 CFA per kilo of cocoa . 
farmers need money in early October to send children to school . 
one exporter said he was not buying , or advancing funds to buyers . 
&quot; We are not financing as the money would be just tied up in bush stocks . 
how can we work under this uncertainty ? 
&quot; he asked . 
he put the rate of cocoa arrivals at 2,000 tonnes per week . 
&quot; It &apos;s only a guess , but arrivals are lower than they should be . 
trucks are around the port one day and then nowhere to be seen the next . 
in September , Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan announced an October 15 opening date for the 1996 / 97 cocoa season . 
forecasters expect a 1996 / 97 main crop harvest of between 850,000 and 900,000 tonnes against a record one million tonnes in 1995 / 96 . 
ivory Coast plans to increase local processing of cocoa to 50 percent of annual output by 2000 .
