Malaysia will host the opening round of the world motorcycle championship in April after settling differences with the series organisers . 
the Automobile Association of Malaysia ( AAM ) signed a contract with grand Prix organisers Dorna on Thursday confirming that it would be the local promoter and organiser for the race in the country until 2001 . 
AAM general manager Khir Anuar Mohamed said the deal guaranteed that this year &apos;s race would be held as scheduled at the Shah Alam circuit outside Kuala Lumpur on April 13 . 
Malaysia has been staging a grand Prix since 1991 through the Selangor state government , which owns the track . 
but the Selangor government &apos;s five-year contract with Dorna expired last year and it refused to renew the agreement this year , saying it might reconsider in 1999 . 
Dorna then issued an ultimatum that Malaysia hold the race again this year or risk losing it in the future . 
Khir Anuar said AAM had to take over from the Selangor government as Malaysia could not afford to lose the prestigious grand Prix and the tourism potential that it offered .
