reserve Bank of New Zealand Deputy Governor Murray Sherwin said on Thursday the bank was not opposed in principle to signing repurchase agreements with other countries , but its foreign exchange reserves were limited . 
Sherwin was speaking before a meeting with Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang , who told reporters the colony was looking to extend its range of repo agreements . 
Sherwin said he had discussed the possibility of such arrangements last year with other Asian central banks . 
&quot; Our basic attitude has been ... since we don &apos;t intervene in foreign exchange markets and we have a very small and very liquid portfolio anyway , there &apos;s nothing in it from our side , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; But we &apos;re not in principle opposed to signing up one of these things if someone felt that it was important to them . 
new Zealand has total reserves equivalent to some US $ 2.7 billion , of which just over $ 1 billion is in U.S. dollars . 
a repurchase agreement enables a country with liquidity pressures to deposit U.S. government securities to the credit of another country at the U.S. Federal Reserve , receiving liquid U.S. dollars in exchange . 
the transaction is later unwound after an agreed period . 
Tsang told a news conference earlier : &quot; Hong Kong is rather keen to enter into repurchase agreements with a number of central banks . 
that came home after the Mexican peso crisis early last year . 
since then , he said Hong Kong had entered six or seven repurchase arrangements with neighbouring countries , &quot; and we can extend and talk to more &quot; .
