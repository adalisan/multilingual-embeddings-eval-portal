Hong Kong shares traded in London showed minimal activity , with little inspiration emanating from leading stock markets , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a quiet day owing to many European bourses closed for ( national ) holidays and a weaker London stock market today , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; There has been scant trading in HSBC and the shares have been trading near overnight levels . 
for many other stocks there has been no volume . 
the Hang Seng London Reference Index was up 13.97 at 14,122.79 . 
on Monday in Hong Kong , the Hang Seng closed up 46.45 to 14,108.82 . 
&quot; Investors trading in London don &apos;t seem to want to commit themselves ( to Hong Kong shares ) ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates , &quot; said another trader . 
the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) will meet on Tuesday to discuss U.S. interest rate policy and fears that the authorities will raise rates have weakened the U.S. and UK stock markets .
