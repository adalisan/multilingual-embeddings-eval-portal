Tokyo stocks fell to a 12-month low Tuesday as the market fretted over the outlook for the Japanese economy . 
the market &apos;s key Nikkei average opened on a lower note and saw losses accelerate as investors turned increasingly gloomy , despite optimistic comments from government officials about Japan &apos;s economic recovery . 
the benchmark index tumbled 528.75 points , or 2.69 percent , to 19,161.71 , the third-biggest drop of the year and the lowest closing level since Dec . 19 , 1995 . 
brokers said the slide reflected a lack of confidence in the government &apos;s assessment of the economy and concerns about the effects of fiscal tightening next year . 
they said the government was too optimistic about the economic recovery and had cut back on economy-boosting measures as a result . 
&quot; The biggest reason for the sharp fall is the gap between the market &apos;s and the government &apos;s perceptions of the economy , &quot; said Hiroyuki Nakai , chief investment strategist at Nikko Securities Co Ltd . 
Japan &apos;s snowballing public debt and dwindling tax revenues have forced the government to raise the consumption tax from next April and to end special income tax cuts from January , although this may hurt the economy . 
the market has also been discouraged by a delay in implementing a corporate tax cut , which had been proposed to support domestic business activities , brokers said . 
those worries took hold last week when the government unveiled a tight budget for the next fiscal year . 
the Nikkei dropped more than 500 points on Thursday to its lowest level since Dec . 21 , 1995 , but managed a modest technical rebound on Friday . 
the market was closed on Monday for a holiday . 
Kenzo Doi , a strategist at Kokusai Securities Co . Ltd , said a lack of foreign investors , the backbone of past rallies , due to the holidays had further dampened the market &apos;s mood . 
&quot; We can &apos;t hope for buying from overseas investors because they are away for the Christmas holidays , &quot; he said . 
one trader at a foreign securities house added : &quot; Many participants held back from buying ahead of the long year-end and New Year holidays . 
some started to close their positions . 
brokers said the market shrugged off several positive comments about the economy made by government officials on Tuesday , and said the possibility of the Nikkei index breaking below 19,000 was already in sight . 
finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference Tuesday that Japan &apos;s economic recovery will likely pick up in the latter half of the next fiscal year and that the recovery will eventually be reflected in the financial markets . 
Mitsuzuka also said the economy was strong enough to withstand any blow from the higher consumption tax , but that cut little ice with investors . 
Japan &apos;s economy has been struggling to pull out of a protracted slump despite record low interest rates and government public works spending .
