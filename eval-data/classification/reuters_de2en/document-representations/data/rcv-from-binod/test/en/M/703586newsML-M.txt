the won closed firmer against the dollar on Wednesday as dollar inflows from exporters and foreign stock investors led to dollar sales , dealers said . 
&quot; Expectations of more dollar supplies , stemming from news on a trade surplus and rising foreign exchange holdings , also helped prompt dollar unwinding , &quot; said a domestic bank dealer . 
the won closed at 887.20 against Tuesday &apos;s close of 887.80 . 
it opened at a day low of 887.90 and touched a high of 887.10 . 
the central bank said foreign exchange reserves rose to $ 33.3 billion at the end of June from $ 31.9 billion at the end of May . 
the central bank said a trade surplus in June and active inflow of foreign funds for equity investment contributed to the increase in foreign exchange holdings . 
South Korea &apos;s customs-cleared trade turned to a surplus of $ 97.6 million in June from a $ 613 million deficit in May . 
the won &apos;s mid-rate is expected to be pegged at 887.40 on Thursday , compared with 888.10 today . 
dealers said trading would range from 887.00 to 888.00 on Thursday . 
&quot; But the dollar could fall to 885.00 / 886.00 unless the central bank support the 887.00 level , &quot; a foreign bank dealer said .
