a cargo of physical Brent crude traded on Wednesday seven cents below Tuesday &apos;s traded level . 
a major bought a February 26-28 cargo at March Brent + 5 cents - down from a + 12 cent deal on Tuesday for a February 22-24 loader , traders said . 
this cargo was additional to the original programme , equity holders said , and was heard destined for Eastern Europe . 
few buyers were seen for the remaining three February loading cargoes and one seller was offering at March + 5 cents - down from an early offer at + 15 cents . 
Brent equity holders expected the March loading programme to be released on Thursday . 
the programme was not expected to hold many surprises . 
&quot; It &apos;ll just be up a bit because of the longer month , &quot; one equity holder said . 
the cargo which was defered on Tuesday was offered by a trader as a Feb 27-Mar 01 loader . 
the only other Brent cargo which might be available was a Feb 26-28 cargo which was not as yet being actively offered , traders said . 
talk of Gullfaks and Oseberg trades on Tuesday could not be immediately confirmed . 
in the Mediterranean , Russian Urals was steady around -90 cents a barrel CIF Genoa as the impact of loading delays at the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk balanced slack spot demand from refiners , traders said . 
&quot; There &apos;s basically been very little change since yesterday , &quot; said one . 
Novorossiisk remained shut on Wednesday because of high winds and swell after reopening for only three hours on Tuesday . 
traders said some Med refiners were eyeing North Sea barrels as margins for regional crudes remain thin .
