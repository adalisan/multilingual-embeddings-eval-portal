several thousand opposition militants defied a ban on demonstrations and political activity in Kinshasa on Wednesday to denounce the presence of Rwandans among Laurent Kabila &apos;s forces and demand that they go home . 
but witnesses said soldiers from Kabila &apos;s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo , who initially allowed the march to go ahead , later broke it up , firing in the air and beating protesters with batons and rifle butts . 
earlier , tens of thousands of residents lined the streets , cheered the marchers and made V-for-Victory signs -- one day before Kabila &apos;s inauguration as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo , his new name for Zaire . 
&quot; Kabila should have a chance but we do not want the Rwandans , &quot; one female student told Reuters . 
&quot; We just do not want the Rwandans . 
they have got to go . 
she was among hundreds of students blocked by soldiers in the central Higher of Institute of Commerce , once a hotbed of opposition to ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko , but many marchers echoed her sentiments . 
there was little sign of soldiers along much of the march route until they intervened to break up the protest . 
earlier they sealed off the Institute campus , dispersed chanting students there and prevented them from taking part . 
&quot; We are here to bring order , that is all , &quot; their commander said . 
he declined to give his name . 
soldiers initially blocked marchers when they set off for the city centre from the capital &apos;s central railway station . 
they then stepped back and the marchers made their way to Victory Square , where Mobutu soldiers shot dead at least 16 opposition protesters during a peaceful rally in 1992 . 
soldiers broke up the marchers as they headed for Tshisekedi &apos;s home district of Limete . 
they arrested several dozen protesters and journalists . 
Kabila himself left the city on Tuesday for the southern mining capital of Lubumbashi . 
officials declined to say why but added they expected him back later on Wednesday . 
the Union for Democracy and Social Progress ( UDPS ) of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi , a veteran Mobutu opponent , called marches for Wednesday and Friday . 
&quot; We are marching to protest about the Rwandans , &quot; said Jean- Claude Mukendi , an unemployed youth and supporter of Tshisekedi , a veteran Mobutu opponent . 
&quot; Mr. Tshisekedi knows the Zairean people do not want to be ruled by foreigners . 
opposition activists marched in Kinshasa on Friday and Saturday . 
Kabila forces fired in the air and took away some protesters . 
government officials said they were later released . 
Kabila &apos;s Alliance , which marched into Kinshasa on May 17 to end seven months of civil war , later banned political activity and public demonstrations . 
Tshisekedi , citing a 1992 vote in a sovereign national conference in what was then Zaire , has doggedly insisted over the years that constitutionally he is prime minister . 
opposition activists say he should be allowed to take office as such . 
Kabila has set up a 13 member government . 
aides say he plans to name seven more ministers but not a prime minister .
