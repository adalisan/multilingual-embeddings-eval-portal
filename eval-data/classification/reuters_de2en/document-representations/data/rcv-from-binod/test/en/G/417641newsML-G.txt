South Korean President Kim Young-sam on Tuesday chose as prime minister a man respected for integrity and plain living to help rescue him from a loans scandal , and even his opponents hailed the move . 
Koh Kun , 59 , was mayor of Seoul from 1988-90 under former president Roh Tae-woo , but quit in a row with the administration over a corrupt land deal involving the same company -- the Hanbo Group -- that is now embarrassing Kim . 
Koh currently is head of Myongji University . 
he succeeds Lee Soo-sung , a legal scholar who was premier for 15 months before he was sacrificed to take responsibility for the scandal involving loans to failed Hanbo Steel Co . 
Kim is purging top administration officials to try to restore his image in an election year . 
three of his closest associates have been arrested in the Hanbo affair , which has shredded his reputation as an anti-graft crusader . 
Kim apologised on February 25 for the scandal and has replaced his chief secretary and three top Blue House aides . 
&quot; President Kim believes Koh Kun is best suited for the job as he has a lot of administrative experience , integrity , a good personality and an ability to make friends , &quot; Blue House spokesman Yoon Yeo-joon told reporters . 
&quot; He is the best choice Kim ever made , &quot; said Moon Chung-in , a political science professor at Yonsei University . 
&quot; He is seen as a politically neutral person with managerial expertise who is respected by many . 
Parliament voted overwhelmingly to approve Koh &apos;s nomination for what has become a revolving-door job in Kim &apos;s trouble-prone administration . 
Kim has discarded five premiers in four years . 
the president is constitutionally barred from seeking a second term , but is anxious to bolster his prestige to give him greater leverage in choosing a successor . 
&quot; We welcome the appointment &quot; of Koh , said Park Hong-yeop , a spokesman for the main opposition National Congress for New Politics . 
the party demanded Kim reveal the full truth behind the loans scandal that has led to 10 arrests , including Hanbo Group founder Chung Tae-soo and top bankers . 
Koh held cabinet posts during the 1980-1988 presidency of chun Doo Hwan and took the university job in 1994 . 
&quot; I believe nobody has been named prime minister with a heavier heart than mine , &quot; Koh told reporters . 
&quot; But I have decided to accept the offer after much hesitation because I can &apos;t evade the responsibility of pulling our country through hard times . 
his reputation for integrity stems from the earlier Hanbo scandal . 
he quit as Seoul mayor rather than bow to pressure and bend zoning rules to let a multi-million dollar property deal for Hanbo go ahead , political analysts said . 
&quot; Koh has spent such a long time in public office , yet has never been involved in a corruption scandal , &quot; said Ra Jong-yil , a political science professor at Kyunghee University . 
&quot; He doesn &apos;t play golf because he believes it &apos;s a luxurious sport that &apos;s often associated with corruption . 
friends of Koh describe an outgoing character who enjoys drinking and prefers plain local eateries to expensive hotels . 
South Korean markets brushed off the change of premier . 
stocks closed nearly flat as investors awaited possible news of a new finance minister . 
&quot; The market showed little interest in the new prime minister . 
but tomorrow it will react , either positively or negatively , when a new finance minister is named , &quot; said Yoo Jae-kyong of Daishin Securities . 
Stephen Marvin , head of research at Ssangyong Securities , said while cabinet members come and go , few influenced economic policy . 
stock markets generally ignored them . 
&quot; My guess is they &apos;re probably all the same because if they had a radically different view they &apos;d never be appointed , &quot; said Marvin .
