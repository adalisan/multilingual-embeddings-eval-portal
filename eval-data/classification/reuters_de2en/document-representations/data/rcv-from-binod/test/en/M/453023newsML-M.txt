Jakarta shares closed higher on Wednesday as rises in blue chip Telkom combined with active buying in some secondaries , brokers said . 
the Jakarta composite Index closed 3.73 points higher , or 0.57 percent up , at 663.17 points after touching an intra-day low of 657.13 points in morning trading as gainers led losers by 59 to 56 and 64 counters unchanged . 
total turnover throughout the day was low at 390.8 billion rupiah representing about 160.8 million shares . 
Telkom had been expected to come under pressure after reports that a consortium linked to President Suharto might be allowed by the government to venture into basic telecommunications services . 
however , Telkom managed to rebound due to buying by some large state-linked brokerage houses , brokers said . 
they said buying managed to keep Telkom in positive territory despite the heavy selling pressure . 
Telkom rose 100 rupiah to close at 3,750 rupiah after touching a low on the day of 3,650 rupiah as some 13 million shares changed hands . 
brokers said Telkom was expected to stay positive on Thursday because of an expectation that it will announce an encouraging 1996 result as scheduled on Thursday afternoon . 
but they said any possible rise was likely to be limited as long as the competition issue remained unclear . 
Telkom said on Tuesday it was seeking clarification from the government regarding any possible changes in the government &apos;s policy on telecommunications which may affect Telkom . 
news reports quoted the Director General of Post and Telecommunications Djakaria Purawidjaja last week as saying Telkom was not unhappy with the rival consortium &apos;s proposal . 
a rebound by Bank Negara Indonesia &apos;s near the close also helped push the index higher , brokers said . 
Bank Negara Indonesia was the most active stock with 14.3 million shares traded . 
it closed unchanged at 1,375 rupiah after touching a day &apos;s low of 1,300 rupiah . 
timber firm Barito Pacific was also actively traded after its subsidiary PT Tanjung Enim Lestari Pulp and Paper secured a $ 991 million foreign loan to build a new pulp mill . 
Small-capitalised agriculture firm Sekar Bumi was also active , rising 225 rupiah to 2,125 rupiah on about seven million shares traded on market speculation of a possible rights issue .
