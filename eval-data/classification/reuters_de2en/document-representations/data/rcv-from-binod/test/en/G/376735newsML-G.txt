Albania is facing its worst crisis since it ditched communism six years ago and President Sali Berisha &apos;s right-wing government has to find a way out of a tight corner to stem an increasingly violent wave of unrest . 
strong-arm tactics by special police forces and the secret police , including beatings and mass arrests , have done little to extinguish the fury of thousands of Europe &apos;s poorest people who have lost everything in failed pyramid investment schemes . 
Berisha &apos;s offer to compensate the get-rich-quick hopefuls with savings books , bonds or shares has fallen on deaf ears . 
Albanians want their money back and they want it now . 
&quot; The government is going to find it very difficult to find that sort of money with the pressures it has on revenue . 
the sums involved are huge , &quot; said heather Grabbe , a research fellow at London &apos;s Royal Institute for International Affairs . 
&quot; They seem to be in a no-win situation , &quot; she added . 
with little chance of finding millions of dollars to hand back to small investors , the options available to Berisha to quell the troubles are few and precarious . 
with tension palpable throughout the country , deploying the army in a tough nationwide crackdown would only serve to inflame tempers further . 
a political gesture , such as sacking the government , could tear the Democrats apart . 
politically , Berisha has entered a weak phase . 
he has to seek re-election by parliament by April 9 . 
under the constitution he is hamstrung . 
six months before his five-year term ends , a president &apos;s powers are curtailed and Berisha cannot dissolve parliament . 
while the Democrats secured 122 seats in the 140-member parliament in last May &apos;s disputed general election , Berisha has still to tread carefully . 
the Democrats are splitting into two camps with moderates scrambling to Berisha &apos;s side and hardliners backing Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi , Albanian political analysts say . 
their views are echoed by the influential co-founder of the Democratic Party , Azem Hajdari , who earned hero status in the 1990 anti-communist revolt by leading students onto the streets . 
a Democrat deputy and trade union leader , he warned the government last year that the pyramid schemes would mean trouble and has distanced himself from the government line . 
&quot; President Berisha is a moderate . 
he will never allow the army or anyone else to open fire on protesters , &quot; Hajdari said in a recent interview . 
&quot; The problem can only be solved if the government resigns . 
a sign of discord within the Democratic Party emerged this week when deputies declined to back a proposal by Meksi to declare emergency measures to stamp out violence in the Adriatic port of Vlore . 
three people died there in a protest on Monday and a policeman was shot dead on Wednesday . 
while government leaders struggle to solve the crisis , the opposition blames the West for failing to react to what it regards as growing authoritarian rule and for remaining silent while democratic commitments were flouted . 
with most diplomatic effort channeled into halting the bloodshed in Bosnia , Western nations , and Europe in particular , paid scant attention next door to the worrying developments in Albania &apos;s fragile democracy , opposition figures charge . 
Berisha &apos;s main rival , Socialist leader Fatos Nano , is in jail on corruption charges . 
Amnesty International and other rights activists say Nano &apos;s trial was flawed and he should be set free . 
Albania &apos;s supreme court chief Zef Brozi dared in 1995 to say Nano was innocent and was subsequently sacked . 
he said this month that Albania was becoming a police state . 
rights groups have expressed concern over the beatings and harassment of opposition members , reporters and photographers . 
a law passed in 1995 banned most former communist officials from standing for public office until 2002 , effectively wiping out most senior opposition figures from the political scene , coincidentally , until the end of a Berisha second term . 
the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) produced a scathing report on last year &apos;s general election , after its observers catalogued irregularities , electoral law violations and cases of intimidation . 
officials rejected the report , even accusing some OSCE monitors of being collaborators of the Stalinist regime of hardman Enver Hoxha . 
the United States called for an early general election , but European governments largely ignored the issue . 
the OSCE says it is worried about the violence in Albania and warned the potential for a serious crisis is at hand . 
&quot; This is a warning to Tirana . 
we are keeping a very close eye on what is going on there , &quot; an OSCE diplomat said . 
but two months after violence began to convulse Albania , the international community maintains its risky hands-off approach in a region which not so long ago experienced Europe &apos;s first war since 1945 .
