new Zealand share prices closed weaker on Monday but volumes were typically light and brokers said the market should still benefit from lower interest rates in the medium term . 
&quot; As time goes on we &apos;d expect to see those short rates come down more and hopefully that freed-up cash will feed through into the equity market , &quot; said Tim Koller at Merrill Lynch . 
the NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 5.01 points weaker at 2,252.30 , with most leading stocks a few cents weaker . 
brokers said a four cent fall in Carter Holt Harvey to NZ $ 3.15 was simply a correction after its good recent run . 
Cultus Petroleum shot to a new all-time high of $ 3.55 before settling at $ 3.48 , up 26 cents on the day . 
on Thursday Cultus told Reuters it expected to double first half profits in the second half and said it would spud several new &quot; wildcat &quot; oil wells this year , which could see a substantial earnings improvement over the next few years . 
Cultus said it believed its Maari oilfield , offshore Taranaki in New Zealand , could produce 100 million barrels , making it one the country &apos;s largest oilfields . 
it was hoped drilling could start in November or December . 
publisher Wilson and Horton , which launched the revamped business section of its flagship newspaper the New Zealand Herald on Monday , gained 10 cents to $ 11.50 . 
the company will hold its AGM in Auckland later this week . 
however , brokers said there was little to stimulate the wider market at present . 
&quot; On the domestic front , we &apos;ll be waiting to see the economy pick up a little bit , which would obviously help company profitability , but ... it &apos;s really a monetary easing that we would hope will give the market a bit of a boost , &quot; Koller said .
