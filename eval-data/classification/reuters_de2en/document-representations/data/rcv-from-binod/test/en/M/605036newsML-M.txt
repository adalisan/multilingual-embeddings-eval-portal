Russian shares ticked lower at the opening on Thursday despite a strong show by Norilsk nickel which dealers said is expected to issue foreign-traded American depositary receipts soon . 
traders said the market looked shaky through the end of the week despite a generally bullish tone . 
one pointed to decreasing volumes as evidence that stockholders were not inclined to sell . 
the Russian Trading System 22-share index opened slightly off at 365.88 from Wednesday &apos;s 365.96 close . 
at 0850 GMT metals group Norilsk rose to $ 7.40 from $ 7.25 and Norilsk prefs rose to $ 4.70 from $ 4.58 . 
Ordinaries were about $ 6.00 a week ago . 
Rostelekom , suffering from questions about its future with Svyazinvest telecoms holding company , part of which is due to be auctioned soon , fell to $ 3.96 from $ 3.99 . 
Thursday volume was seen unchanged or falling on Wednesday &apos;s $ 39 million , barely considered a healthy market . 
traders said Wednesday &apos;s growth was on domestic speculation of foreign buying after the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged . 
but Westerners did not storm the market . 
&quot; There is still no strong support from the West that could globally move the market to a new level , &quot; said Rye , Man and Gor Securities salesman Kirill Maltsev . 
&quot; The most important thing is the monetary question for flows of serious , long-term capital . 
the State Duma lower house of parliament is considering plans to cut 1997 budget spending and also to print new money but traders disagreed whether Western investors were concerned with the Duma . 
it is questionable whether the Duma could really change government spending plans . 
&quot; People understand that the Duma does not count , &quot; said ING Barings head trader Peter Kizenko . 
he said technicals pointed to a bull market , as did shrinking share liquidity but predicted the market would drift lower this week , waiting for a spark .
