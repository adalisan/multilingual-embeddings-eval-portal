Taiwan &apos;s money rates closed softer on Tuesday despite central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong &apos;s open call for higher short term rates , dealers said . 
the overnight interbank rate ended at 4.568 percent against Monday &apos;s 4.645 , with the 30-day commercial paper at 4.60-4.70 percent against 4.70-4.75 . 
dealers said rates might rise on Wednesday after the central bank on Tuesday issued T $ 10 billion in NCDs to mop up excess liquidity . 
it was not known whether a rise eventually might result from Sheu &apos;s comment that the overnight interbank rate was too low and would be better at five percent . 
dealers warned that current loose banking system liquidity would limit any significant rise in rates , saying they expected the interbank rate to move between 4.75 and 5.00 percent -- below Sheu &apos;s target -- in the near term . 
the government bond market reported no transaction in the afternoon . 
traders said they did not expect major movements in bond yields due to stable , loose current liquidity . 
some traders said it was possible that bond yields would rise slightly on Wednesday but they also expected buying to limit any gains .
