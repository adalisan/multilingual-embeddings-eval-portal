price stability should be an ongoing goal of monetary policy and be best achieved by bringing inflation lower gradually , Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William McDonough said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Price stability must be viewed in a long-run context as an ongoing goal , not a one-time objective , &quot; McDonough said in remarks delivered before the Society of Investment analysts in Dublin . 
the speech was made available in New York . 
McDonough echoed Fed chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s view price stability is achieved &quot; when people do not consider inflation a factor in their business and economic decisions . 
reiterating price stability is a prerequisite to sustainable economic growth , McDonough also pointed out &quot; even moderate inflation rates can cause substantial diversion to non-productive financial activities . 
McDonough , the vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee , also cautioned that &quot; even when an economy is set on the path to price stability , and price expectations are contained , it does not necessarrily mean that all potential sources of inflationary shocks have been eliminated . 
McDonough also noted the difficulty in assessing the impact of short-term monetary policy decisions on the economy . 
&quot; The appropriate course , consistent with maintaining longer-term price stability , should be to bring inflation down somewhat gradually , as the economy adjusts to the shift in relative prices , &quot; he said . 
the New York Fed president also stressed the importance for a central bank to be independent , help maintain a sound banking system , &quot; and not be directly responsible for financing government budget deficits .
