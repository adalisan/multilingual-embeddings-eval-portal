German and French stocks recovered their composure to close higher on Tuesday , but London lost ground on interest rate concerns after a bullish start . 
all share and currency markets were to some degree holding their breath ahead of a decision , due after the end of European trading , from a key U.S. monetary policy-making meeting . 
bourse sentiment generally was not helped by another weak start by New York stocks . 
the Dow Jones average was down eight points by the time European bourses closed . 
dealers and analysts were deeply divided over whether the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) committee would sanction its first credit tightening for 1-1 / 2 years . 
British stocks reversed their opening gains to close 9.2 points lower with shares in banks , a driving force behind London &apos;s recent rally , pushing the FTSE index down . 
HSBC , Barclays and NatWest led the retreat as fears of a U.S. rate hike prompted profit-taking . 
a signal from the Bank of England that it had , as expected , left interest rates unchanged after the government &apos;s monthly monetary meeting made little impact on shares . 
nor did reports showing Britain &apos;s stronger-than-expected 2.2 percent economic growth in the second quarter . 
German shares ended bourse trade higher , although volumes remained generally limited , and they held on to their gains in post-bourse electronic trading . 
the DAX index of blue chip shares ended 11.41 points higher at 2,638.45 . 
on the Paris bourse , stocks held their early gains to close up after a day of quiet trading ahead of the Fed decision . 
brokers said a quarter-point rise in U.S. interest rates was already priced into the market . 
one Paris disappointment was Europe &apos;s largest steelmaker Usinor Sacilor , privatised last July . 
its shares dropped after it announced that first-half profits plunged 65 percent and warned that its second half earnings would be even weaker . 
on the currency front , too , the mood was one of wait and see . 
the dollar closed an uneventful European session barely changed as forex dealers stayed squarely focused on the outcome of the Fed meeting . 
robust U.S. consumer confidence data for September provided more ammunition for the hawkish FOMC members to argue for a rate rise , analysts said . 
U.S. treasuries fell on the strong report , but the dollar showed no marked response . 
dealers said the dollar &apos;s response to the FOMC meeting would depend on how the decision was explained to the market . 
a rate hike sold as economic fine tuning would soothe markets , while a poorly explained rise which suggested more tightening was in store would hit asset markets and the dollar . 
the dollar was at 1.5122 marks and 109.73 yen compared with 1.5120 marks and 109.88 yen in Europe late on Monday . 
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares closed 9.2 points down at 3,910.5 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index closed 14.41 points up at 2,081.50 . 
gold closed at $ 382.10 , up from Monday &apos;s London close of $ 381.25 . 
silver ended up one cent at $ 4.89 .
