new Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said on Thursday that solid steps to improve relations with Greece could take place soon , after a U.S.-brokered agreement between the two rivals this week . 
&quot; There is a serious possibility of concrete developments in the coming days , &quot; Cem said in a statement . 
the two countries agreed at a NATO summit in Madrid on Tuesday to respect each other &apos;s rights and renounce the use of force in their longstanding dispute over the Aegean Sea . 
&quot; The text of the agreement is essentially what we have been proposing to Greece for years . 
this time Greece is officially sharing in our goodwill and peace plans , &quot; Cem said . 
Ankara and Athens have long been at odds over the divided island of Cyprus , whose Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders are holding talks this week in New York state . 
the two countries also differ on ethnic minorities and territorial rights in the Aegean , which last year brought them close to conflict . 
six principles were agreed upon after a meeting between Cem and Greek counterpart Theodoros Pangalos , together with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright . 
the agreement was welcomed in both countries , but officials said action was needed to back up the paper pledge . 
it was not clear what steps Cem was referring to . 
he took over as foreign minister only last week as a member of the left-right coalition that replaced the outgoing Islamist-led government of former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan . 
&quot; No one has lost in this agreement , both sides have won , &quot; Cem said . 
frequent rows with EU member Greece have prevented Turkey from fulfilling its decades-old ambitions to get closer to the European Union .
