President Bill Clinton was expected to give a strong statement on fighting global warming next week at a U.N. environmental summit , but he will not offer targets and schedules for cutting heat-trapping pollution , administration officials said on Wednesday . 
Clinton &apos;s speech at the &quot; Earth Summit Plus Five &quot; at the United Nations in New York will be watched carefully as a signal on how tough a stance the United States will take in international talks aimed at cutting emissions from burning fossil fuels . 
&quot; It will be a place for the president to stake out a strong , moderate course , &quot; a White House official said . 
&quot; If we &apos;re going to have an agreement , we &apos;re going to have to try to create a consensus . 
we would argue that we are taking a strong leadership role in trying to reach a consensus , &quot; he said . 
Clinton will join some 70 world leaders to discuss a number of environmental issues including climate change , and to evaluate successes and failures since the ground-breaking Earth Summit held five years ago in Rio de Janeiro . 
environmentalists said this summit should elevate their issues to the government leaders &apos; attention , but most doubted that it would produce many substantive results . 
&quot; The sad fact is a tremendous opportunity to galvanize the world community around some specific targets and timetables is being missed , &quot; Clifton Curtis , of Greenpeace International said . 
he said that was partly because a key player -- the United States -- was in &quot; damage control on most issues . 
the White House was under heavy pressure from industries to resist harsh measures to slash pollution that they said would devastate the United States economy . 
the United States was also the most glaring example of the rich countries that pledged money and resources at Rio to help poorer countries on the path of environmentally-sound development , but failed to deliver government assistance , environmentalists said . 
&quot; For the developing world , finance will dominate the summit . 
they want developed countries to reaffirm assistance in helping them achieve sustainable development , &quot; Curtis said . 
but industrialized countries were expected to focus more on what world leaders say about global warming and how aggressively they feel nations should fight pollution that is heating the atmosphere with potentially dire consequences of rising sea levels , more severe weather and the spread of tropical diseases . 
&quot; President Clinton &apos;s speech is being viewed as a critical juncture to moving the global warming issue forward , &quot; Daniel Lashof , of the Natural Resources Defense Council , said . 
&quot; What we have called on the president to do is to make it clear the United States wants to have substantial emissions reductions below 1990 levels by no later than 2005 , &quot; he said . 
a number of environmental groups sent Clinton a letter to that effect this week , and blasted the administration for seeming to take a weaker stance than the European Union . 
the EU wants to try to stabilize the the build-up of carbon gases in the atmosphere by making industrialized nations cut emissions to 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010 . 
the U.N. summit also will deal with issues such as the dwindling availability of drinkable water in developing countries , managing the oceans &apos; diminished resources and disposing of toxic wastes . 
the United States also may tangle with Canada , Malaysia and most European countries , which want to negotiate an international treaty on saving the world &apos;s rapidly vanishing forests . 
the United States , joined by many other countries , contends there already is a legal framework to protect forests and a treaty would only delay action .
