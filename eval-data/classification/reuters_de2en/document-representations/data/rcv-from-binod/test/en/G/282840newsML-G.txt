Australia struggled to master Pakistan &apos;s spin attack to labour to a disappointing 199 all out in their limited overs World Series match on Wednesday . 
Australia all-rounder Steve Waugh gave the innings early momentum by scoring 42 in 55 balls after captain Mark Taylor won the toss in fine conditions at the Sydney Cricket Ground . 
but Pakistan &apos;s quartet of spinners -- Saqlain Mushtaq , Shahid Afridi , Aamir Sohail and Mushtaq Ahmed -- gradually asserted their dominance to subdue the batsmen on a slow wicket . 
Australia were dismissed in 47.1 overs , failing to bat out their quota of 50 overs . 
the four Pakistani spinners bowled all but 15 overs in the innings , claiming a combined total of seven wickets to the dismay of a sell-out crowd of about 40,000 spectators . 
Australia , who lead the triangular competition with four points from three games , were further handicapped by the run outs of opener Taylor for 11 and all-rounder Tom Moody for four . 
Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq earned both wickets with direct hits on the stumps from in the field to add to his economical bowling figures of three for 23 in 7.1 overs . 
Pakistan have summoned Ijaz Ahmed Jr. and Mujahid Jamshed from home to strengthen their batting ranks after opener Saeed Anwar was ruled out for the rest of the tour because of a virus , an Australian Cricket Board spokesman said . 
Pakistan and West Indies both have two points in the competition .
