France signalled their intention to return to their free-flowing style on Wednesday with the much anticipated appointment of former international full-back Pierre Villepreux to assist coach Jean-Claude Skrela . 
Villepreux , widely respected as a formidable tactician who espouses the traditional open French game , will start by helping France in their bid to win the Five Nations tournament which opens with an away match against Ireland on January 18 . 
he was already a member of the commission that reflects on the game . 
today he takes on a new dimension , &quot; French Rugby Federation ( FFR ) president Bernard Lapasset said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve taken our time , it &apos;s true , &quot; said Skrela , a former team mate and joint coach with Villepreux at Toulouse . 
&quot; I know Pierre well , we have coached together enough to know there won &apos;t be any problems . 
&quot; In any case , we have worked together for a year on the ( style of ) play and we &apos;ll have no difficulty in finding the right organisation for training the French XV , &quot; said Skrela , who took over from Pierre Berbizier after the 1995 World Cup . 
Lapasset , also confirming Jo Maso as team manager and head of the selection committee , said the new set-up would remain in place at least until the 1999 World Cup . 
Villepreux said : &quot; When Bernard Lapasset told me he was going to put forward my nomination to the board , I was thrilled , of course . 
&quot; I &apos;m going listen a lot , discuss a lot , watch a lot . 
it &apos;s a wonderful opportunity to do something new . 
I take this as a great chance and a personal challenge . 
Villepreux , a 53-year-old physical education professor at the University of Limoges , can be expected to teach France , at a low ebb after losing the two-test series against South Africa last year , his ideas of &quot; total rugby &quot; . 
a taboo subject under the previous administration of Albert Ferrasse , Villepreux had previously exported his ideas to Italy and on a brief sojourn helping the England management in 1989 . 
Villepreux , one of France &apos;s best ever full-backs during a 37-cap career between 1967 and 1975 , helped sow the seeds of Toulouse &apos;s European Cup triumph last season with 10 years &apos; work in conjunction with Skrela from 1981 to 1991 . 
he was a modern , overlapping full-back also noted for his goal kicking .
