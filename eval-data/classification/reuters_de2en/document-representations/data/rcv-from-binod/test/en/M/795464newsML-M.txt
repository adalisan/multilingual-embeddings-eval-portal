mortgage backed securities prices were higher late this session . 
activity today was moderate as market participants digested a pair of economic reports this session that proved to be supportive of Treasury prices . 
&quot; The higher coupons did better today , &quot; said a New York trader , who noted , though , that &quot; duration concerns may crop up . 
discount coupons were as much as 14 / 32 firmer , while premium mortgage coupons were 8 / 32 to 11 / 32 higher . 
as reported , July retail sales rose 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent . 
the decline in consumer prices was the seventh consecutive decline , according to the US Labor Department . 
wall Street economists polled by Reuters had been calling for a 0.1 percent increase in producer prices . 
retail sales , meanwhile , had been expected to rise 0.7 percent in July . 
one market player said that participants may have been surprised by the data and said that many investors will go to the sidelines , or remain on the sidelines until there is a clearer idea where Treasury prices will go . 
the industrial production and consumer price data for the month of July will be released Thursday . 
economists surveyed by Reuters expected July consumer prices to have risen 0.2 percent , July industrial production is seen having risen 0.2 percent . 
if the economic reports to be released Thursday erode Treasury prices and send yields higher , mortgage spreads to treasuries may narrow . 
if the industrial production figure is stronger than expected , market players will closely watch out for the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting slated for next week to see if central bankers are concerned about inflation , said William Gooch , a mortgage-backed analyst at Legg Mason Wood &amp; Walker . 
participants said that some investors are looking into well-structured PAC securities ( planned amortization class securities ) to ride out the market &apos;s uncertainty over the coming session . 
the PACs , reasoned a market player , can better withstand any rate environment -- meaning a decline in interest rates will not erode their prices if prepayment concerns get revived . 
late in the session , 10-year Treasury notes rose 14 / 32 to 98 13 / 32 to yield 6.34 percent . 
among 30-year 7 1 / 2-percent MBS , Government National Mortgage Association bonds were up 12 / 32 at 100-31 / 32 to yield 7.38 percent , Freddie Mac bonds were up 11 / 32 at 101-6 / 32 and Fannie Maes were up 12 / 32 at 101-1 / 32 .
