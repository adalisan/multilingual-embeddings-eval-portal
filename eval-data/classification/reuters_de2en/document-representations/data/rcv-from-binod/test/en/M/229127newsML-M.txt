U.S. treasuries opened lower on Monday as investors took a few profits after Friday &apos;s advance . 
the 6-1 / 2 percent 30-year bond was down 8 / 32 to 101-20 / 32 , yielding 6.38 percent in early trade . 
on Friday , its yield fell to 6.36 percent , the lowest level since its March 4 close of 6.34 percent . 
&quot; All the press reports of a very healthy start to the Christmas spending season are helping to encourage some profit-taking , &quot; said Josh stiles , senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A. 
&quot; The extent of Friday &apos;s run-up , which was related to month-end factors , left the market open to profit-taking as well , &quot; said stiles . 
&quot; You have to find out if there is follow-through buying once those month-end factors are out of the way , &quot; he said . 
stiles said some players might have been reluctant to short the market in the midst of month-end portfolio adjustments , but now that those have passes , &quot; they might be more inclined to adjust their positions . 
analysts said the market &apos;s focus is now on the NAPM ( National Association of Purchasing Management ) report . 
&quot; The market is kind of braced for a 50 to 51 type number with no price pressures emerging either , &quot; said stiles . 
&quot; But even if you get a surprising rise , you still have to take into consideration that all the longer term surveys like APICS and Dun and Bradstreet show expecations for manufacturing are lower . 
economists polled by Reuters estimated , on average , that the NAPM index would edge up slightly to 50.8 in November from 50.2 in October . 
a stronger-than-expected NAPM reading would would encourage a little more profit-taking and shake out some players , but it would &quot; not turn things around in a big way , &quot; said stiles . 
economists polled by Reuters estimated , on average , that construction spending fell 1.0 percent during that month after September &apos;s 1.9 percent rise . 
the week ahead is peppered with second-tier data leading up to the crucial monthly payroll employment report on Friday . 
economists estimate , on average , that payrolls expanded by 179,000 jobs in November , according to a Reuters poll . 
&quot; You have potential for a re-evaluation of what the market &apos;s done recently after the payroll number , &quot; said stiles . 
&quot; The consensus is for a below-trend rise ( in payroll growth ) , about 170,000 to 180,000 new jobs when trend is about 200,000 , &quot; said stiles . 
other aspects of the November employment report will also be important to the market . 
if the unemployment rate reaches a new cyclical low of five percent or 5.1 percent , that would likely revive the issue of how tight the Labor market is . 
&quot; That &apos;s the kind of debate that would limit the market &apos;s gains and could shake a few people out , &quot; said stiles .
