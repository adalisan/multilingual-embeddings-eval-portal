leading women &apos;s groups said Monday that Paula Jones spurned their offers of help in her sexual harassment case against President Clinton . 
lawyers for Jones assailed women &apos;s groups as hypocritical for not rallying to help her suit against Clinton in the same vocal fashion they did for Anita Hill , the former law professor who accused Supreme Court Justice-designate Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in a celebrated 1991 case . 
&quot; They are unprincipled and hypocritical , &quot; Joseph Cammarata told reporters in decrying the absence of organised support for his client after arguments about the Jones case were heard in the Supreme Court . 
but women &apos;s groups said politics had overshadowed women &apos;s rights in the Jones case . 
Patricia Ireland , president of the National Organisation for Women ( NOW ) , personally offered to help Jones but was rejected , NOW communications director Diane Minor said . 
&quot; She seemed to dismiss Ireland &apos;s availability rather disdainfully , &quot; Minor said , instead aligning herself with personalities such as conservative publicist Floyd Brown and anti-abortion activist Randall Terry . 
Ireland offered to talk to Jones &apos; lawyers and even to fly to Long Beach , California , where Jones now lives , for a meeting , but was turned down . 
Ireland insisted NOW was not politically biased against Jones because it has supported Clinton . 
she said NOW members picketed the White House because of Clinton &apos;s stance on the welfare law . 
&quot; And we called for the resignation of a strong abortion rights backer , ( Oregon Sen. Bob ) Packwood , at a time when we needed every vote we could get in the U.S. 
Senate . 
Packwood resigned last year in the midst of a sexual harassment scandal . 
Eleanor Smeal , president of the feminist Majority Foundation , said opponents of women &apos;s rights groups were using Jones to advance their case . 
&quot; They are using it to fit their political goals . 
it &apos;s the strategy in this case to attack the women &apos;s movement , &quot; she said . 
&quot; It &apos;s an orchestrated attack on us . 
she &apos;s surrounded by anti-feminist groups and people . 
it &apos;s a very right-wing attack &quot; 
Smeal said she stated in a television interview that she was willing to discuss the case with Jones but she never heard from her .
