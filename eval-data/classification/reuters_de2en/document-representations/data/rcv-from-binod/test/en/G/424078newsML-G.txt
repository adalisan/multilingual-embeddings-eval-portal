U.S. planes flew the last of 1,160 African peacekeepers and 452 tons of equipment into Liberia earlier this week , the Defence Department said on Thursday . 
it said five C-130 cargo planes delivered the peacekeeping forces from Mali , Ghana and Cote D &apos;Ivoire to join 2,000 African peacekeepers already there . 
they are enforcing a peace plan brokered by West African neighbours under which Liberia is to hold presidential and legislative elections on May 30 to end seven years of civil war . 
the war in the country founded by freed American slaves in 1847 killed well over 150,000 people .
