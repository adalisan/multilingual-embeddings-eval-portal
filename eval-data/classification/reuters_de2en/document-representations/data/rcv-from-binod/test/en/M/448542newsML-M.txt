Shenzhen &apos;s A and B share indices closed higher in active trade on Monday with investors focusing on issues expected to report solid 1996 results , brokers said . 
concerns about a possible crackdown on speculation by authorities in Beijing also eased , the brokers added . 
the B share index gained 4.91 points or 2.98 percent to close at 169.99 points . 
the A share index put on 7.51 points or 1.8 percent to end at 423.68 as turnover rose to 12.4 billion yuan from Friday &apos;s 8.4 billion . 
&quot; investor confidence recovered because Beijing did not announce any new anti-speculation policies at the weekend , &quot; an analyst with China Guotai Securities Co said . 
talk that Beijing planned to tighten rules on stock trading had cooled market sentiment late last week , brokers said . 
&quot; We saw strong demands for stocks which are expected to post robust 1996 results , &quot; a trader said . 
brokers said Monday &apos;s advance was also linked to Beijing &apos;s announcement of a low bank interest rate subsidy for April . 
people &apos;s Bank of China , the central bank , set the rate at 0.17 percent , down from the March subsidy of 0.94 percent . 
&quot; The lower rate indicates the central government &apos;s confidence in controlling retail price inflation , which lifted market sentiment , &quot; the Guotai analyst said . 
retailer Chengdu Hualian was the biggest gainer in the A share market , closing the session up 1.23 yuan , or 10 percent limit-up , at 13.49 yuan on volume of 2.1 million shares .
