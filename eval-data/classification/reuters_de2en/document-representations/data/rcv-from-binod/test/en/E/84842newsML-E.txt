leading economist and central bank board member Ardo Hansson believes the Estonian economy is in danger of over-heating although Economics Minister Andres Lipstock disagrees , newspaper Aripaev said . 
Hansson , who was an adviser to former radical free-market prime minister Mart Laar , told the newspaper that commercial banks have to slow down . 
&quot; The biggest danger facing the Estonian economy is not the slowing of economic growth but the economy &apos;s over-heating and growth beyond its abilities , &quot; Hansson said . 
five years after quitting the former Soviet Union , Estonia is seen as one of eastern Europe &apos;s fastest reformers . 
&quot; Estonia &apos;s problem is excessive demand rather than demand reaching a low point , &quot; Hansson said . 
Hansson cited a big budget deficit in the Tallinn City council , the growth of money in circulation , the inflow of foreign funds and big salary rises to back his view . 
Estonia &apos;s GDP rose three percent last year and estimates for the current year range between one and three percent . 
it has an advanced privatisation programme and an open economy . 
the IMF has also warned against a growing public sector deficit , which it said could lead to higher inflation . 
&quot; The Estonian economy needs a cool shower rather than an extra incentive , &quot; Hansson said . 
he said banks should limit their growth and pay more attention to the quality of their loan portfolios rather than boosting their assets and expanding . 
Lipstock disagreed with Hansson . 
&quot; Estonia &apos;s economy is not over-heated ... a well-developed banking sector has been the main driving force behind the development of the Estonian economy , &quot; he told the newspaper .
