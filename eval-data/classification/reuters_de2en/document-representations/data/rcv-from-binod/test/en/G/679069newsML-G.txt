Spain &apos;s Socialists chose veteran politician Joaquin Almunia on Sunday to replace his longtime ally , former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez , as head of the party . 
overcoming opposition from the party &apos;s left wing , Almunia -- a former cabinet minister who had worked for years in Gonzalez &apos;s shadow -- was elected to the top leadership role by an overwhelming majority of delegates at the Socialist congress . 
&quot; We are now a more united party , &quot; Almunia told cheering supporters . 
the vote was the culmination of a fierce internal power struggle unleashed by Gonzalez &apos;s announcement on Friday that he was stepping down as the party &apos;s secretary-general , a position he had held for most of the past 24 years . 
Gonzalez , who steered Spain through an era of sweeping democratic renewal after nearly 40 years under dictator Francisco Franco , told the party faithful it was time for a &quot; change of generations &quot; in the Socialist hierarchy . 
Almunia , 49 , the party &apos;s parliamentary spokesman , quickly emerged as the top choice from a list of Socialist heavyweights that included regional presidents , national deputies and big city mayors . 
but it was only after a night of tense , closed-door negotiations with the party &apos;s regional powerbrokers -- and a series of key concessions -- that Almunia won the backing needed to guarantee his election .
