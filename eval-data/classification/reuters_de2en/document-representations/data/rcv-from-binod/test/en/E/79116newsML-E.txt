the Common Fund for commodities , a U.N. affiliate , is looking to address problems of supply disruption at origin stemming from economic reform , the fund &apos;s managing director Rolf Boehnke said on Thursday . 
the break up of internal marketing regimes had &quot; led to disruptions in the delivery chain from the farmer in developing countries through local traders to exporters and finally consumers in developed countries , &quot; he told the &quot; Conference on commodities - Africa on the World Market &quot; . 
and although farmers had in some cases received a higher share of revenues , they were now exposed to higher market risks . 
Boehnke said the first project in this context would be discussed by the Fund &apos;s executive board in October and would analyse and seek to solve problems in the coffee sector . 
a second , more specific project was being prepared to improve the workings of coffee markets in Uganda , Tanzania and Zimbabwe . 
and a third project was being prepared for cocoa in Cameroon , Ivory Coast , Ghana and Nigeria , he added . 
&quot; emphasis is given in these projects on improved access to international markets and to reducing technical and price risks . 
privately-run warehouses and the establishment of collateral warehouse receipts systems will be supported , &quot; Boehnke said . 
on a broader level , he said the Common Fund would direct more attention in future to vertical diversification and on projects that were likely to generate an economic return and so could be loan financed . 
the Fund would also seek closer collaboration with the African Development Bank and strengthen its ties with African regional economic organisations . 
Boehnke welcomed the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) as a new member . 
but there is a cloud hanging over the Fund &apos;s finances . 
its first account , set up to finance international buffer stocks , was in good shape with total resources of $ 178 million . 
as there was only one fully operating commodity agreement with a buffer stock -- the International Natural Rubber Organization -- discussions were under way to decide how this account could be used more effectively . 
the second account , established to improve structural conditions and long-term competitiveness of commodities , had a different problem . 
when first set up , 23 countries pledged $ 212.7 million but so far only $ 67.1 million had been paid in . 
&quot; If the fund is to fulfil its role ... it should be provided with adequate financial resources and therefore the pledges should be honoured , &quot; Boehnke said .
