CSCE world sugar futures were called to open 0.05 cent lower Monday as traders expect the market to continue to look to downside after five consecutive sessions of losses . 
in her closing comment Friday , Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes said the market is likely to continue to trend lower due in part to a lack of physical offtake .
