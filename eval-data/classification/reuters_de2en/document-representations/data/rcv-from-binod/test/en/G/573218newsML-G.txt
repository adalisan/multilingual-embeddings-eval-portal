ties between France &apos;s Socialist and Communist parties cooled on Friday , apparently after opinion polls showing the possibility of an upset left-wing victory in the May 21-June 1 parliamentary election . 
the Socialists , by far the strongest partner in the left-wing coalition , have increasingly indicated they would push through their own election platform , ignoring the Communists &apos; political agenda in case of victory . 
some media said Socialist leader Lionel Jospin had already decided not to include Communist chief Robert Hue in a left-wing cabinet even though the Communists would have contributed to an election win . 
the spat came out into the open with the Communists criticising Jospin for seeking to impose &quot; hegemony &quot; on the left and the party &apos;s newspaper refusing to publish an open letter by Jospin to voters . 
the snub was the latest sign of tension between the two left-wing opposition allies in the run-up to the snap parliamentary election called by President Jacques Chirac . 
the daily L &apos;Humanite , which failed to publish Jospin &apos;s article , had earlier published the full text of an article by President Jacques Chirac attacking the left &apos;s record and programme on Wednesday . 
&quot; This sort of exchange of letters turns the election into a sort of presidentialisation which is inappropriate , &quot; the outgoing Communist National Assembly floor leader Alain Bocquet said . 
&quot; It is desirable that the left which wins the parliamentary elections should be a balanced left . 
for the left to succeed , we need a more influential Communist party , &quot; he told RTL radio . 
the Communists , who oppose a single European currency , were angered when Jospin pledged this week that if the left won the Socialists would impose their broadly favourable line on European economic and monetary union on left-wing partners . 
Communist leader Robert Hue hinted in a television interview on Thursday night that his party might make a referendum on the single currency a condition for supporting a Socialist-led government . 
&quot; We will have to negotiate taking account of the weight which each party will have received from voters , but without trying to align some behind others . 
I want to say formally that that is the condition for this left-wing majority to be possible , &quot; Hue said . 
political analysts said the Communists &apos; highlighting of their differences with Jospin seemed mainly intended to deter their working-class electorate from voting Socialist on the first ballot for tactical reasons . 
they noted that while Hue continued to press for a referendum , he had not specifically ruled out a single currency . 
&quot; Is victory possible ? 
&quot; The trend is in our favour , we are on an upwards trend , &quot; he said after a poll on Thursday showed the ruling centre-right &apos;s campaign lead had almost vanished in the National Assembly . 
the ipsos poll showed the ruling centre-right with 290 of the 577 seats , the Socialist 264 , the Communists 22 and the National Front one . 
it was the narrowest lead for Prime Minister Alain Juppe &apos;s coalition since Chirac , elected to a seven-year term ending in 2002 , gambled his presidency by calling the early election . 
voters , weary of political sleaze and rising unemployment , dumped the Socialists in the last National Assembly elections in 1993 . 
both factors now threaten Juppe &apos;s coalition . 
polls show many voters are disillusioned with politicians and believe neither the Socialists nor the right have answers to their main concern -- record unemployment of 12.8 percent . 
one group hoping to cash in on the disillusionment is the extreme rightist National Front whose leader Jean-Marie Le Pen compared foreign immigrants to birds of the field when he said his policy was not to expel them but &quot; allow them to leave &quot; . 
&quot; I say we should stop giving foreigners what attracts them and explain to them we don &apos;t have the means to support them or even to give them employment . 
they &apos;ll leave by themselves , &quot; Le Pen said . 
&quot; It &apos;s not a question of sending them back , we &apos;ll allow them to leave , &quot; he said .
