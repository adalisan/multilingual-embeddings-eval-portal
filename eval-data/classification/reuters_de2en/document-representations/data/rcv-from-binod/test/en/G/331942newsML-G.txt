a U.S. congressman who recently visited East Timor urged the Clinton administration on Thursday to take the lead in tackling human rights abuses on the Indonesian-controlled island . 
highlighting reports of torture and killings , Representative Frank Wolf suggested Washington send a high level envoy like Gen. Colin Powell , the former chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , to discuss the situation with Indonesian officials . 
&quot; It is time for the administration to actively search for solutions to human rights problems in East Timor , &quot; Wolf said at a news conference . 
Wolf , a Virginia Republican , visited East Timor from Jan . 12-14 and also met with Indonesian officials in Jakarta . 
&quot; East Timor is at the bottom of the scale on human rights , &quot; Wolf said . 
&quot; No one goes out after dark . 
he said many of the people he met in East Timor were afraid to talk to him but some told of killings , torture , beatings and disappearances carried out by Indonesian military and police . 
Wolf also suggested that President Bill Clinton meet with Nobel Peace Prize-winning Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo when he visits the United States later this year . 
Belo won the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize along with exiled resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta for their efforts to resolve the conflict in the former Portuguese colony . 
Indonesia took control of East Timor in 1975 , but the United Nations has never recognised the takeover . 
Wolf said the United States should use its influence and good relations with Indonesia to help ease tensions in East Timor . 
he said Washington should work with the United Nations , Portugal and Germany , which also has close ties with Jakarta . 
&quot; It &apos;s just the right thing to do , &quot; Wolf said . 
he questioned whether campaign contributions from Indonesian companies and individuals to Clinton and the Democratic Party may have influenced U.S. policy on Indonesia and East Timor , but said he did not know if this was true .
