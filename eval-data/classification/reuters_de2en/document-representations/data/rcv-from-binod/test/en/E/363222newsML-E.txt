Morocco should speed up its economic and social reforms to ensure a sustainable annual growth of 5.0 to 6.0 percent of gross domestic product and reduce social disparities , the World Bank said . 
the Bank , in a 60-page report obtained by Reuters on Friday , said : &quot; The next three years will be decisive for Morocco to set up conditions for a sustained futur development ... But Morocco can meet the target of an annual 5.0 to 6.0 percent growth of GDP on condition it speeds up its vast reform programme . 
in the last 10 years , the country has made great steps towards transforming its economy , to good growth and stability of its macro-economic indicators , the Bank said in the report issued last month . 
&quot; But the economy remains extremely sensitive to drought and is too little diversified . 
the fundamental elements of growth are inadequate as is shown by weak saving and investment rates , &quot; the report said . 
Morocco &apos;s economy posted a growth of 11.8 percent in 1996 and would register between 3.0 to 4.0 percent growth in 1997 , Finance Ministry Mohamed Kabbaj recently said . 
he said national saving rose to 19 percent of GDP against 16 percent in 1995 . 
but investment dropped to 20.5 percent in 1996 , from 22 percent in 1996 , he said . 
&quot; Morocco also needs to reduce the unemployment and rural poverty , &quot; the Bank &apos;s report said . 
urban unemployment is estimated at 18.5 percent in 1996 and according to the Statistics Directorate , an estimated 13 percent of Morocco &apos;s 27 million inhabitants live below the poverty line and earn around $ 300 per year . 
Morocco &apos;s GDP reached 316 billion dirhams ( $ 34.3 billion ) in 1996 , or an average $ 1,300 per head . 
&quot; The macro-economic equilibrium remains precarious and debt remains a serious issue , &quot; the Bank said . 
Morocco &apos;s total debt is estimated at $ 21 billion of which the Treasury holds a stake of $ 14 billion . 
it represented 60 percent of GDP in 1996 against 68 percent in 1995 , Kabbaj has said . 
Kabbaj forecast that the debt would drop to 40 percent of GDP by the year 2000 .
