an end to Cambodia &apos;s civil war could deliver a sizeable peace dividend and help curb widespread government corruption , opposition leader Sam Rainsy said . 
the Khmer Nation Party ( KNP ) president said an end to the war against Khmer Rouge guerrillas would allow the government to halve its defence budget and eliminate corruption , saving more than $ 6 million . 
Rainsy , a former finance minister whose party is not legally recognised , told the Foreign correspondents Club of Cambodia late on Thursday that the government spends too much on defence . 
the Khmer Rouge signed a peace accord in 1991 but later reneged on the accord and have since been fighting the coalition government that emerged from U.N.-run elections in 1993 . 
&quot; I would not be surprised if two-thirds of the current total expenditures are devoted to the army . 
this is terrible . 
no country can bear such a burden , &quot; Rainsy said . 
he also alleged that corrupt officials were using some 100,000 &quot; ghost &quot; civil servants , police and soldiers to collect extra salaries . 
the government acknowledges that corruption is a major problem , reflecting in part the administration &apos;s poverty and an influx of money after the signing of the 1991 peace accord , but officials have said Rainsy overstates the situation . 
Rainsy said well-armed military and civilian officials have also used the instability of the civil war to screen illegal activities , which he said include logging Cambodia &apos;s dwindling forest reserves and smuggling goods across its borders . 
the government has been negotiating with breakaway commanders of the Khmer Rouge , which was responsible for the deaths of more than one million people during the group &apos;s 1975-79 rule . 
officials hope the talks will help bring an end to more than two decades of strife and destruction . 
Rainsy was sacked as finance minister in 1994 and was last year expelled from the royalist FUNCINPEC party and parliament because if his criticism of the government .
