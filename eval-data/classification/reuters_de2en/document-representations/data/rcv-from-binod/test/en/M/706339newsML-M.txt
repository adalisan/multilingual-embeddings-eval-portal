Australian bond spreads narrowed to other dollar bloc debt on Thursday as the market remained confident there was room for a local rate cut , and on the back of continued offshore buying . 
spreads to the U.S. 10-year bond narrowed back towards the 50 point level that has so far proved tough resistance , while spreads to New Zealand long bonds went back into negative territory . 
new Zealand bonds weakened on Thursday after RBNZ Governor Don brash said that the market had eased too far away from those he had outlined in last week &apos;s Monetary Policy Statement . 
helping underpin the Australian market &apos;s recent outperformance are the continuing expectations of a rate cut . 
however , traders felt the short end had gone as far as it could without a rate cut being actually delivered . 
at the long end , pressure on the spread to treasuries would keep further gains in check . 
this meant that the curve flattening that had occurred over the past week may have gone as far as it could , and the curve could start to steepen again . 
&quot; I think you &apos;ll probably see the curve stuck in a range between 82 ( points ) and the mid to high 90s for a while , &quot; one trader said .
