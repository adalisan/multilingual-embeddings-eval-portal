Spain &apos;s 1996 third quarter GDP growth of 2.2 percent year-on-year reflects a pick-up in the economic cycle , fuelled by strong growth in foreign demand , the National Statistics Institute INE said on Wednesday . 
in a note , INE said the 0.6 percent increase in third quarter GDP from the second quarter &quot; confirms a low in the cycle in the second quarter of the year , with a new phase of aggregate activity growth starting in the third quarter &quot; . 
in the second quarter , GDP rose 2.0 percent year-on-year , revised up from 1.9 percent . 
but INE added that the recovery stemmed from a mixture of factors , including foreign demand &quot; significantly higher than the previous quarter ... and with domestic demand maintaining the decelerating tone which has characterised it for one year &quot; . 
construction demand was especially low , down 5.3 percent year-on-year in the third quarter , while capital goods rose 8.4 percent .
