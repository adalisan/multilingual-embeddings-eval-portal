Northern Ireland &apos;s chief Protestant politician , David Trimble , on Sunday branded two leading Irish nationalists who won seats in the British parliament as senior members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) . 
but Irish Republic Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring suggested the success of Sinn Fein party president Gerry Adams and his chief negotiator Martin McGuinness in Britain &apos;s May 1 election could improve chances of an IRA ceasefire in its struggle to end British rule in Northern Ireland . 
Ulster Unionist Party leader Trimble , a bitter enemy of the IRA and its Sinn Fein political arm , said in a television interview there was no sign that Republicans were in a mood to call off violence to win places for Sinn Fein in all-party peace talks . 
he told Sky News that British security forces believe both men hold high places in the command structure of the guerrilla movement that is fighting to oust Britain from the province . 
&quot; The security forces in Northern Ireland ... regard both Adams and McGuinness as still being members of the IRA &apos;s Army Council . 
&quot; They are involved in directing the terrorist campaign , I think there is no doubt about that .. , &quot; Trimble said . 
&quot; IRA and Sinn Fein are inseparable and they are operating as one group , so that Adams and McGuinness must accept responsibility for all the actions of the IRA and of those groups that operate under their influence . 
Adams and McGuinness have consistently denied they are linked with the underground extremist group . 
spring , in a separate Sky News interview , said he would &quot; like to think that the strengthened mandate that they now have would give them the authority to deliver a ceasefire ... 
&quot; A lot of people think that they will be the ones to deliver again . 
a 17-month IRA truce broke down in February last year when the guerrillas accused Britain of breaking a deal to give Sinn Fein a place in talks on a political settlement . 
Irish nationalists say that Adams and McGuinness had a a key role in persuading the IRA leadership to declare the first ceasefire in September 1994 . 
they were reported to be guerrilla commanders when the Northern Ireland conflict erupted some 27 years ago . 
in 1972 both went to London with an IRA delegation for what proved to be abortive peace talks with a British Minister . 
the new parliamentarians , who will not take their seats in the legislature in protest against British rule , say they head a party committed to a peaceful resolution of the province &apos;s conflict . 
violence flares again at the weekend when an off-duty police officer was shot dead in a bar by members of the Irish National Liberation Army , a small left-wing republican splinter group . 
with tension high , a Protestant was attacked and seriously hurt by a Roman Catholic gang in Londonderry and a Catholic victim of a Protestant mob was buried in the town of Portadown .
