leader Tony Blair warned his Labour party on Wednesday not to take its big opinion poll lead for granted and said it must spread the word that another victory for the Conservatives would spell disaster for Britain . 
in a pep-talk to his members of parliament , Blair said Labour was entering the most important stage of its campaigning for the general election , which must be held by May 22 . 
labour , in opposition since 1979 but ahead of the Conservatives by about 20 percentage points in polls , had to work harder to communicate its policies to voters and show how it would make a difference for the better , he said . 
&quot; We must also warn people of the dangers a Tory fifth term could bring . 
we have been so far ahead in the polls for so long that we are virtually treated as the incumbent ... &quot; Blair said . 
but he added : &quot; The election is not over until the last vote has been cast . 
we must take nothing for granted . 
and we must get people to focus more than they are on the Tory record , and what it might mean for a fifth Tory term . 
&quot; All of us must take out the message to the country : that a Tory vote could mean another Tory government -- and that would be a disaster for Britain . 
Blair said a fifth consecutive Conservative victory did not bear thinking about . 
&quot; It will mean 23 years of unbroken Tory rule . 
it will mean they think they can do whatever they want . 
&quot; It will mean five more years of weak leadership , five more years of an ungovernable party . 
it will mean they will stop at nothing . 
labour &apos;s foreign affairs spokesman , Robin Cook , will launch a campaign on Thursday aimed at drawing voters &apos; attention to what Blair called the Conservatives &apos; record of lies , broken promises and failures .
