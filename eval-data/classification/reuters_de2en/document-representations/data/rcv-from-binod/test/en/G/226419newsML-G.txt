Algerians have voted overwhelmingly for constitutional changes banning Islamic political parties , according to official results of a nationwide referendum announced on Friday . 
official figures showed 85.8 percent or 10.94 million people voted &quot; yes &quot; for a draft constitution against 14.19 percent &quot; no &quot; in Thursday &apos;s referendum , Interior Minister Mustapha Ben Mansour told a news conference broadcast live on Algerian radio . 
he said turnout was 79.8 percent of the 16.4 million electorate with about 359,000 unvalid votes . 
the endorsement is expected to strengthen the hand of President Liamine Zeroual ahead of parliamentary elections set for the first half of 1997 . 
Ben Mansour said a huge security operation thwarted Islamist guerrilla threats to disrupt the referendum . 
&quot; Peace , freedom and calmness marked referendum day , &quot; Ben Mansour said , hailing efforts of the country &apos;s security forces to protect voters . 
the Armed Islamic Group , or GIA -- most feared of Algeria &apos;s fundamentalist guerrilla movements -- threatened to &quot; strike the neck &quot; of voters . 
Algiers-based diplomats said the government deployed more than 300,000 soldiers and policemen to guard voters across the country , five times the size of France . 
residents in the garrison town of Blida , 50 km ( 30 miles ) south of Algiers , said the army shelled mountains near the city on Wednesday night , apparently trying to pre-empt any buildup of Moslem guerrillas . 
Blida is a route for guerrillas seeking to carry out attacks around the capital . 
more than 60,000 people have died in Algeria &apos;s violence since 1992 when the authorities annulled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead . 
opposition parties had called for a boycott of the poll or for Algerians to vote against the changes . 
the new constitution bars politicians from campaigning on the basis of the Moslem faith , the Arab or Berber languages , gender issues or regional differences . 
it gives the country &apos;s two legal Islamist groups -- Hamas and Nahda -- a year to change their manifestoes . 
Algeria &apos;s largest fundamentalist group , the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) , was banned shortly after the 1992 elections were cancelled . 
high &quot; yes &quot; returns were reported in a number of areas , including 95 percent in the western town of Mascra and more than 90 percent in the southeastern region of El Oued and the southwestern province of Saida , said state radio . 
the Berber-dominated northeastern town of Tizi-Ouzou was one of the exceptions with nearly 63 percent of the voters opposing the draft constitution , the radio added . 
the planned constitution says Arabic will be the only state language , angering Berber activists who want official recognition for their language as well . 
the lowest turnouts were in Berber areas , where a Berber-dominated party had called for a boycott . 
only a quarter of the electorate in Tizi-Ouzou voted .
