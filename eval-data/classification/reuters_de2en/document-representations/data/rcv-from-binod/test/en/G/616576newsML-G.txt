Ecuador &apos;s deposed President Abdala Bucaram on Monday minimised the impact of a plebiscite in which many voters endorsed his ouster , saying the results were preliminary and made the interim government look weak . 
&quot; We have to point out , 24 hours after a plebiscite characterised by high absenteeism , that the results are preliminary and were issued by a private company , &quot; Bucaram &apos;s spokesman Hatuey Castro said in a statement . 
&quot; The electoral tribunal should be the official voice of the government . 
in the plebiscite on Sunday , one exit poll and a projection based on early returns by two separate firms showed 74 percent of Ecuadoreans endorsed the removal of Bucaram after Congress declared him &quot; mentally insane &quot; six months after taking office . 
three separate polling companies also showed that between 62 and 65 percent of voters endorsed Alarcon as interim president . 
Alarcon will rule until August 1998 , when he will be replaced by a new president to be elected in May next year . 
final results from the plebiscite are expected to be announced next week . 
Castro said the level of abstention , at around 30 percent , showed that &quot; the popularity of interim leader ( Fabian Alarcon ) has plummeted in the past 100 days . 
only one in three Ecuadoreans support the government . 
the statement said a plebiscite &quot; that was designed to combat him ( Bucaram ) on the contrary offered him the unequivocal backing of one-third of the Ecuadorean electorate . 
in Panama on Monday , Bucaram kept an uncharacteristically low profile and cancelled a scheduled news conference . 
but his supporters denied that the former leader was keeping quiet because Panama was reviewing his political asylum situation . 
&quot; That has nothing to do with it . 
he is not speaking until official results are known , &quot; Castro said . 
Panama , which gave Bucaram political asylum last month , said it would study his status following Sunday &apos;s vote . 
Bucaram is wanted in Ecuador on charges of mishandling public funds and corruption . 
he has repeatedly denounced Alarcon for orchestrating his ouster with the military . 
both the interim president and the armed forces deny the charge .
