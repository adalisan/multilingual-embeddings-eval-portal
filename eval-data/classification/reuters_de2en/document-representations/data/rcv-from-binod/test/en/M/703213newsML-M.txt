Irish bonds were marked up in price for the second day on Wednesday but volumes continued to be very low , dealers said . 
&quot; Despite the firmer prices , it &apos;s just one of those days for Irish bonds , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; The recent currency revaluation rumours , while very unlikely , are still supporting the market , but things are pretty slack . 
dealers said that no dramatic movements were expected in the wake of the British Budget &quot; unless it contained something extraordinary &quot; . 
by 1510 GMT , the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was up 16 pence at 102.76 to yield 5.75 percent , while the eight percent bond due 2006 was up 30 pence at 110.65 to yield 6.42 percent . 
yields against German Bunds were broadly unchanged from Tuesday &apos;s close to 150 basis points over in the five-year bond , and 89 over in the 10-year . 
recent rumours of a revaluation of the Irish pound ahead of EMU have largely been discounted by the market , although the punt has been buoyed up nevertheless . 
&quot; While a short term revaluation is unlikely in the extreme , the rumours are making people think twice about selling the punt , &quot; a dealer said . 
foreign exchange dealers said earlier that the rumours may have originated in bond market speculation . 
bond dealers have complained that the weak punt has been causing Irish bonds to underperform against Spain and Italy over recent weeks . 
meanwhile , dealers said that tax moves by the UK Chancellor to curb consumer spending would be welcomed by the market . 
&quot; If we see stiff taxes to contain spending then the less likely it is that the Bank of England will raise interest rates and that is bond market-supportive , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; If it &apos;s a very tough Budget and sterling falls in response , then that would be good for the punt . 
however , the market was not expecting any &quot; radical &quot; measures to emerge from this afternoon &apos;s Budget . 
the market would be watching for news from today &apos;s conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting to deliberate interest rates , dealers said . 
economists do not expect the Fed to hike interest rates this time around . 
at home EBR figures are also due later today and credit data tomorrow will be a market focus .
