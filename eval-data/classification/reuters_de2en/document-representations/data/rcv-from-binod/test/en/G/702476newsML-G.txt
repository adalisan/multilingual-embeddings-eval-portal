Afghanistan &apos;s purist Islamic Taleban militia was advancing towards the opposition-held capital of the northeastern province of Takhar on Wednesday , a Pakistan-based Afghan news service said . 
the Afghan Islamic Press ( AIP ) reported that the militia had launched a major offensive against opposition forces in Takhar from neighbouring Kunduz province on Tuesday evening . 
the attackers broke through opposition frontlines and thrust into Khwaja Ghar and Bangi districts , where fighting was going on about 30 km ( 19 miles ) west of Taloqan , the provincial capital . 
the militia earlier captured the Qabr-i-Qazi district , east of Kunduz , AIP said . 
it said the Taleban had killed 20 soldiers loyal to former government military commander Ahmed Shah Masood and captured 135 after intense fighting in which the Taleban lost three dead . 
AIP said local commanders had joined the Taleban offensive , swelling the militia &apos;s ranks to 1,500 from an initial 1,000 . 
several opposition leaders , including ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani and Ittehad-i-Islami chief Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf , have used Taloqan as a temporary base since the Taleban drove the Rabbani government from Kabul in September . 
AIP said two helicopters had taken off from Taloqan for an undisclosed destination on Tuesday , apparently with opposition leaders on board , but could not identify them . 
no other reports of the fighting were immediately available .
