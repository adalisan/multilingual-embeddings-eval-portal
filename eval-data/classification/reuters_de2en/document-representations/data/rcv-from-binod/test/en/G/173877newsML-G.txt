Morocco &apos;s anti-drug squad said on Thursday it had arrested two Belgians and one Moroccan after seizing more than one tonne ( 2,200 lbs ) of cannabis in two separate operations in the north of the country . 
the two Belgians , whose names were not given , were drivers of a coach in which 399-kg ( 878 lbs ) of cannabis resin was found on Wednesday . 
the coach , belonging to a Dutch company with headquarters in Belgium , was searched while it was in the north Moroccan port of Tangiers , the squad said . 
ferries from the port serve Spain and France and scores of foreigners have been arrested there trying to smuggle drugs to Europe . 
the drug squad said the rest of the cannabis , 702 kg ( 1,544 lbs ) was found in a raid in the Mediterranean coastal city of Nador where a man identified as Benali Bouziane was arrested . 
Morocco has launched a crackdown on drug trafficking and arrested and jailed hundreds of foreigners on drug-related charges in the past two years . 
late last month , three Dutch and four French nationals were arrested , while the previous month two Britons were held and accused of being part of an international network running drugs to Spain . 
on Wednesday , French police said they had seized 250 kg ( 550 lbs ) of cannabis of Moroccan origin , transiting through Spain and supplied by a newly-emerged network .
