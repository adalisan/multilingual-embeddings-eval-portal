the speaker of Poland &apos;s lower house of parliament Jozef Zych said on Thursday he was likely to set the date of this year &apos;s parliamentary elections for September 14 or 21 , PAP news agency reported . 
Zych said during a meeting with students in the southern city of Krakow that the final decision on the date had yet not been taken , PAP said . 
by law , the lower house &apos;s speaker must set the election date for a day free of work that precedes the end of parliamentary term by four weeks . 
the decision must be taken four months before the end of the term , which falls for October 14 , 1997 . 
the elections will pit co-ruling ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) against a rightist bloc led by the Solidarity trade union , now outside parliament , but neither is expected to gain a majority . 
smaller parties , such as co-ruling Peasant Party , centrists Union for Freedom ( UW ) or right-radical Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland ( ROP ) , are likely to hold a balance of power in parliament .
