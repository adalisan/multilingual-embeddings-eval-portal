Hong Kong spot gold ended firmer on Thursday compared with New York &apos;s previous close on shortcovering and some physical buying , dealers said . 
with Hong Kong traders back at work for the first time since last Friday , most of the market was actively covering short positions , dealers said . 
the market reopened on Thursday after a five-day public holiday to mark Hong Kong &apos;s handover to Chinese rule on July 1 . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ll see some consolidation and then it may go back down , &quot; said one bullion dealer . 
physical buying also provided support to prices , although some dealers said demand had tapered off slightly . 
the carry over charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society remained unchanged from its previous fix at -6.00 .
