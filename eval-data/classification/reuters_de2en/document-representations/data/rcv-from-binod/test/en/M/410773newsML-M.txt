Italian bonds went into a tailspin in late trade with BTP futures shedding 200 basis points and the lira crashing through the psychological 1,000 per mark barrier for the first time since rejoining Europe &apos;s currency grid . 
&quot; It &apos;s volatile out there . 
there has been a lot of selling today from people getting out of long positions and sitting on the sidelines , &quot; one broker in London said . 
&quot; With March delivery on Tuesday , rather than rolling over positions to the June future , people are just closing down their positions , &quot; he said . 
the March future on LIFFE was 203 basis points down at 127.76 while June futures fell 179 to 127.60 . 
the November 2006 BTP fell 128 basis points to 102.49 while the yield headed up to 7.51 percent and the spread over the benchmark Bund yawned to 195 basis points . 
the lira had a rough ride at the hands of foreign currency investors , plunging through the 1,000 per mark barrier for the first time since rejoining the ERM last November . 
traders said despite Bank of Italy attempts to prop the currency up by selling marks at 998.50 earlier , the lira was on its way down . 
they said a clean break at 1,000 would propel the currency lower to 1,005 . 
rumours of plans afoot for a delay in European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) drove investors to the sidelines to await calmer days . 
the Bundesbank and German finance ministry dismissed talk that any statement on a delay was in the works . 
&quot; Despite the denials people are thinking that a delay in EMU could be possible , &quot; a trader here said . 
on the news front , the Bank of Italy insisted on further budget cutting measures from the government this year and a committal hearing to decide whether Prime Minister Romano Prodi should go on trial for alleged abuse of office was adjourned until March 19 .
