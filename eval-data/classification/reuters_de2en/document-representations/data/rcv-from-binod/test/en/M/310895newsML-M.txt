CSCE coffee futures ended slightly higher in chart-driven dealings Thursday , as speculators shook off some bearish news and pushed the spot March contract up to a fresh eight-month high , traders said . 
March delivery settled 0.45 cent per lb firmer , at 123.05 cents , its highest settlement since May 16 , after ranging from 124.20 to 121.50 . 
on the continuous weekly chart , March &apos;s finish Thursday was the highest in more than a month . 
Second-position May ended up 0.55 cent , to 119.55 cents , while the outer months rose 0.10 to 1.25 cents . 
volume reched an estimated 10,126 lots . 
a rise in monthly Green Coffee Association of New York stock levels and news Colombian dock workers reached an agreement to end a two-day strike weighed on prices initially , traders said . 
but the market &apos;s continued strong technical stance eventually won over speculators , they added . 
&quot; It was like the news never happened , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; From a technical standpoint , the market still looks good . 
the GCA reported after Wednesday &apos;s close supplies of green coffee in U.S. warehouses rose in December by 63,000 60-kg bags , to 1,327,000 bags . 
although traders had expected a rise between 50,000 and 100,000 bags , the build was slightly bearish , they said . 
news Colombian dock workers reached an agreement with cargo operators Thursday to end the strike that has paralyzed the Pacific coast port of Buenaventura also weighed on the market , traders said . 
the strike , which began late Tuesday , had by Wednesday delayed shipment of 90,000 60-kg bags of coffee destined for export . 
despite the negative news and an apparently overbought condition , Allendale Inc. analyst Jim Cordier said the market could still work higher . 
&quot; The trend is turning and heading higher even though it is due for a correction , &quot; Cordier said . 
&quot; It should be well supported near the highs . 
on the charts , near-term resistance remained at 125.00 cents basis March , while support was seen around 120.00 cents . 
traders are turning their focus toward Brazil , where an emergency meeting of ACPC members will be held on January 23 . 
the council was called after African nations , backed by Colombia , expressed the need for exports between January and June this year to be cut further .
