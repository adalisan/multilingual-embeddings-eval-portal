the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-making arm , will convene today and on Wednesday to consider interest rates policy . 
international Moscow Bank dealer Anton Sukhoverko said prices could be a little over the market on Wednesday , as investors saw current yields as resistance levels .
