President Bill Clinton on Thursday will unveil plans for more than 100 federal agencies and departments , including the White House , to hire several thousand welfare recipients over the next four years , an administration official said . 
the official said Clinton would convene his Cabinet to go over the plans , drawn up in response to the law he signed last year that ended the federal entitlement to welfare , limited benefits to five years and required people to work after two . 
&quot; We expect to announce a commitment to hire the people across the federal government , including within the White House , &quot; said the official , who asked not to be identified . 
&quot; This is the federal government doing its share to fulfill the president &apos;s commitment to move people from welfare to work . 
since signing the controversial law , which deeply split his own Democratic Party , Clinton has travelled the country calling for businesses , non-profit groups and religious organizations to hire welfare recipients . 
he himself estimates the country will need to move some two million off the welfare rolls over the next four years . 
on March 8 , Clinton instructed the members of his Cabinet to draw up detailed plans to hire welfare recipients , citing how they would recruit them and what jobs they would fill . 
as part of his effort to give prominance to the effort , he is convening the special Cabinet meeting on Thursday and has invited two women who escaped the welfare system and now work at the Social Security Administration , the official said . 
he added that the White House plans included hiring people to work on the Domestic Policy Council , responsible for the administration &apos;s welfare policy , but noted its efforts would be small next to those of the government &apos;s larger agencies . 
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore , who was put in charge of the effort , are due attend the meeting , which is scheduled to take place at 1 : 30 p.m. EDT ( 1730 GMT ) on Thursday in the White House Cabinet Room .
