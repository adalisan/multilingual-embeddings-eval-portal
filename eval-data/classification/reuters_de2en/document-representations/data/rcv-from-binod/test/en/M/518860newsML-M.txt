BTPs will push higher on Thursday to challenge trendline resistance at 129.25 , technical analysts said . 
and if the market holds above that level at the close , it has the potential to move up towards 130.80 , then 131.04 with a new contract high above 131.76 on the cards , they added . 
&quot; The whole structure of the market looks pretty constructive here , &quot; said Chase technical analyst Guenter Redeker . 
&quot; It looks like we may have established a corrective bottom at 123.60 and have entered a fifth Elliott wave up . 
if that is correct , we will certainly see a new contract high . 
by 0812 GMT , June BTPs were up 37 basis points at 128.89 , just off an earlier high of 129.05 -- mild resistance from a daily high on April 15 . 
&quot; If it breaks that , it will challenge trendline resistance at 129.25 , &quot; said Redeker . 
&quot; A break of that level confirmed by a daily closing price above here would certainly mean we will test 130.80 ahead of 131.04 . 
charts show the market hit a daily high of 131.04 on February 10 . 
&quot; If we get above 131.04 then it would move towards ... the contract high on January 23 , &quot; Redeker added . 
Redeker said the market outlook would weaken if it went below Wednesday &apos;s low of 128.26 . 
below there minor Elliott support at 128.08 would kick in , followed by trendline support at 127.76 . 
analysts at a European bank here were more pessimistic on the outlook for BTPs . 
&quot; The intraday picture displays activity that could be implying an end to the current run soon -- so watch out , &quot; they said . 
&quot; 127.00 looks to be a better buy than 129.00 .
