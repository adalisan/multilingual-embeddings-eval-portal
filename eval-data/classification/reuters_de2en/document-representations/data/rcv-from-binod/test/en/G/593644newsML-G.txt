thousands of volunteers started evacuating millions of people from the path of a cyclone heading towards the Bangladesh coast from the Bay of Bengal on Sunday . 
&quot; Around 15 million people live on the coast and nearby islands , and it &apos;s a difficult task to get them away from the feared cyclone , &quot; one cyclone official said . 
&quot; We have already started the process because the cyclone now looks definitely heading towards our coast , &quot; he told Reuters . 
witnesses said thousands of people were taken to cyclone shelters by trucks and other vehicles as strong wind and rain had started hitting the coast . 
&quot; This operation may be hampered when the storm gains strength as night grows , &quot; said police Inspector Abu Yusuf supervising the evacuation . 
at least 33,000 government and Red Crescent volunteers fanned out in Bangladesh &apos;s coastal areas on Sunday after weather officials said the storm , with winds up to 200 kph ( 120 mph ) , might hit the coast by early Monday . 
they said the entire coast was likely to be swept by rainstorms before the cyclone makes its actual landfall . 
it could trigger waves of up to four metres ( 12 FT ) that could swamp widespread coastal areas , including islands . 
fishermen have been warned not to leave port and coastal officials had been told to hoist &quot; great danger &quot; signals . 
according to a latest bulletin from the Storm Warning Centre the cyclone was located 510 km ( 316 miles ) south southwest of Chittagong port at 3 p.m. ( 0900 GMT ) on Sunday . 
&quot; The storm is advancing at a speed of 25 kph ( 16 miles an hour ) . 
the speed may gather momentum and in that case the storm is expected to hit the coast after midnight , &quot; Amirul Hussain , regional director of the Meteorological Department , told Reuters . 
&quot; The volunteers have been asked to closely monitor the situation and standby for large scale evacuation , &quot; said Abdul Wahab , a Bangladesh Red Crescent field official . 
&quot; Sitting on the cyclone &apos;s eye are the ports of Chittagong and Mongla and the Cox &apos;s Bazar resort , &quot; he said . 
officials at the Chittagong port said some 24 ships , now berthed at jetties , would be moved soon to outer anchorages . 
&quot; We are taking this precaution so the ships do not collide during the storm and jam the channel by sinking , &quot; said Quamrul Islam , Harbour Master of Chittagong port . 
Mongla port officials said they were taking similar action . 
meanwhile , one man was killed and five injured when lightning struck them near Cox &apos;s Bazar on Sunday afternoon , local officials said . 
state-run radio and television frequently broadcast storm warnings . 
people fleeing their homes or being moved to cyclone shelters have been asked to keep drinking water , food and other essentials underground for the cyclone &apos;s aftermath . 
Bangladesh &apos;s worst cyclone in 1991 killed more than 138,000 people and left millions homeless .
