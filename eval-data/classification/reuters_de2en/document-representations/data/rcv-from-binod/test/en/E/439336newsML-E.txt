top U.S. government officials visited Guatemala on Wednesday seeking to revive trade with Central America , a region businessmen said the United States had forgotten since the Cold War . 
President Bill Clinton &apos;s Special Envoy for the Americas , Thomas &quot; Mack &quot; McLarty headed the mission , ahead of Clinton &apos;s first visit to the region in May when he is due to meet his Central American counterparts in Costa Rica . 
McLarty and top U.S. Commerce Department officials attended a forum in Guatemala City with 100 U.S. firms , who delivered a clear message that the region should not be forgotten . 
&quot; We are very glad the Commerce Department is looking at Central America because we felt we were being left behind , &quot; Spencer manners of the American Chamber of Commerce in Costa Rica told reporters . 
manners and other business chiefs said Asian and European leaders have led business delegations to Central America in recent years , while the United States fell behind . 
&quot; We have to be extremely careful that the United States does not allow other developed countries to take this market away from us , &quot; manners said . 
McLarty agreed the U.S. should not be caught napping . 
&quot; This is a natural market for us , but not a captive one , &quot; he told reporters . 
trade is at the top of the agenda for Clinton &apos;s visit , and the Central American leaders will demand greater access for their exports to U.S. markets . 
McLarty said he could not predict how Clinton would react to the request . 
he drew attention to the major changes in the region , once a battleground for Cold War forces where the United States in the 1980s pumped in billions of dollars to help right-wing governments defeat rebels . 
all rebel conflicts have now ended . 
&quot; Five or 10 years ago it would have been aid , not trade at the top of that agenda , &quot; McLarty said . 
on Thursday McLarty was due to visit a camp in Guatemala where left-wing rebels who fought the government for 36 years are disarming after signing a peace treaty on Dec . 29 .
