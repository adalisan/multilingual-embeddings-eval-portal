the dollar closed mostly lower but hovered not far below a 42-month high set earlier versus the yen amid ongoing questions about Japan &apos;s political outlook since the general election last Sunday , dealers said . 
the sliding yen briefly bolstered the Swiss franc , while the pound and the mark reached their highest levels since February 1993 against the Japanese unit . 
the strength of these currencies took a slight toll on the dollar , which was otherwise sidelined by the yen &apos;s action , traders said . 
&quot; It is really not the dollar that &apos;s trading at all , said John Nelson , a senior vice president at ABN-AMRO Bank in Chicago . 
&quot; It is just the yen being weak against a whole host of currencies and that is forcing people to liquidate long- dollar positions against the Deutschemark and and Swiss franc . 
the dollar rose to 114.39 yen -- its highest since April 1993 , when it reached 115.20 -- just before the U.S. open . 
but it closesd at 114.23 / 28 yen , down from 114.30 / 35 at the open . 
the dollar closed lower at 1.5191 / 96 marks , compared to 1.5220 / 25 at the open and ended unchanged at 1.2605 / 15 Swiss . 
the yen declined as Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto continues to try to stitch together a government more than a week after the October 20 vote , dealers said . 
Japan &apos;s dominant Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) won the most seats in the lower house of Parliament . 
but it fell just short of capturing an absolute majority in last week &apos;s vote and has so far failed to find a partner to form a new coalition government . 
most bets are now on the Prime Minister going into the new parliamentary session as the head of a minority government -- making fresh elections a constant threat . 
&quot; People are variously attributing it to a lack of a political settlement in Japan , &quot; said Dennis Pettit , foreign exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan , New York . 
&quot; There are still ongoing negotiations to form a coalition and a lack of progress on that front is seen as the main factor undermining the yen , &quot; Pettit said . 
the dollar &apos;s advance picked up steam early Monday when U.S. unit hurdled 113.60 yen , a major top from January 1994 that was nearly retested during last week &apos;s rally . 
the yen also continues to take a beating as Japanese investors shed low-yielding Japanese financial instruments in favor of richer yields found in investments denominated in dollars and most major currencies , traders said . 
in addition , the political stalemate is compounding the yen &apos;s problems by diminishing the odds that the present policy of holding Japanese interest rates at record low levels will be altered soon by a new government . 
&quot; Its the concept of the hung parliament and ... that interest rates are going to remain low there , &quot; said Tim Summerfield , senior foreign exchange trader at Bank of Boston . 
at the close , the dollar stood at Canadian $ 1.3445 / 50 , up from C $ 1.3439 / 44 at the open . 
the pound was barely changed , finishing at $ 1.6120 / 30 compared to $ 1.6120 / 25 . 
the Australian dollar closed firmer at $ 0.7918 / 23 versus $ 0.7908 / 13 at the open .
