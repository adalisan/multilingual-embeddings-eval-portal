U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the Israeli-blockaded city of Nablus on Saturday to discuss troubled peace negotiations between the PLO and Israel . 
&quot; Obviously there are differences and we &apos;re trying to find the best way to overcome them . 
we &apos;re working very hard to make progress , &quot; Ross told reporters after lunching with Arafat in the West Bank city ringed by Israeli tanks . 
Ross is mediating negotiations that began this week between Israel and the Palestinians on implementing a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron . 
&quot; There is not one inch of progress in the talks . 
we hope the U.S. administration , taking part in the talks , will press Israel to implement the accord signed and witnessed by no other but President Bill Clinton , &quot; top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters . 
&quot; We hope the U.S. administration and President Clinton will stop dealing with Israel as a state above the law , &quot; Erekat said . 
the negotiations were decided on at an emergency Washington summit after fierce Palestinian-Israeli clashes last month in which 60 Arabs and 15 Jews were killed . 
the Hebron redeployment should have been carried out in March but was delayed by the previous Israeli government in the wake of Islamic militant suicide bombings that killed 59 people in Israel in March and February . 
it was frozen by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is demanding changes in the deal which he says are necessary to ensure the security of some 400 Jewish settlers who live amidst 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron . 
Palestinians refuse to amend the Hebron accord . 
they accuse Netanyahu , who ousted Israel &apos;s previous centre-left government in May elections , of trying to rewrite the accord signed by Israel &apos;s previous government . 
Arafat was given a rousing welcome by thousands of Palestinians in Nablus on Saturday on his first visit since last month &apos;s clashes . 
Israel deployed tanks in the West Bank for the first time since the 1967 Middle East war during the fighting and they remain in plain sight around Nablus . 
&quot; We sacrifice our blood and soul for you Abu Ammar , &quot; thousands chanted using Arafat &apos;s nom de guerre as his helicopter set down in the town . 
Arafat chaired a joint meeting of the Palestinian Authority &apos;s cabinet and the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) executive . 
he plans to visit Jordan next week for talks on Middle East peace efforts . 
Jordan &apos;s King Hussein , who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 , has been outspokenly critical of Netanyahu since the clashes erupted over Israel &apos;s opening of a new entrance to a tourist tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Arab East Jerusalem . 
Waqf ( Islamic Trust ) officials opened Jerusalem &apos;s al-Aqsa mosque complex , Islam &apos;s third holiest site , to tourists on Saturday for the first time since the fighting . 
low level PLO-Israel talks on civil affairs relating to Hebron were to be held on Saturday night in Jerusalem , Palestinian sources said . 
negotiations resume in full force at the Egyptian resort of Taba on Monday .
