Swiss bonds charged higher , with the Swiss government bond yield index dropping to levels last seen at the start of the year . 
&quot; We had an extremely strong price rise with very high volume . 
I can &apos;t remember last when we had such high volume , &quot; one Swiss bond trader said at the end of Wednesday &apos;s session . 
a drop in long-term yields below 4.00 percent , a key level for Swiss pension funds , was a likely catalyst for the stampede into higher-yielding longer maturities . 
traders said that at the same time , investors were selling the shorter end of the curve . 
&quot; It was notable that customers were selling the short end . 
people are willing to take higher risks . 
there were hardly any sellers , &quot; the trader said . 
he added that in the cash market , some federal bonds with longer maturities of eight to 12 years rose by nearly 90 ticks . 
&quot; sentiment was an unbelievably positive . 
you could almost call it panic buying . 
people were simply seeking higher yields , &quot; he said . 
confederate bond futures volume totaled an estimated 3,600 contracts . 
the average yield of government bonds at midday was 3.77 percent , the lowest level seen since January .
