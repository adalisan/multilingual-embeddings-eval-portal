a lawyer for Democratic National Committee official John Huang asked a federal judge on Monday to set limits on questioning by a conservative legal group in a civil lawsuit against the Commerce Department . 
&quot; My client is back . 
we are ready and willing to go forward with this deposition any time this court sets , &quot; said lawyer John Keeney , who accepted the subpoena on Sunday for Huang , a former Commerce Departmemt official . 
the group Judicial Watch wants to question Huang on Tuesday as a witness in its two-year-old lawsuit under the Freedom-of-Information law claiming the Commerce Department failed to release requested documents on trade missions led by late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown . 
the group claims the department used trade missions improperly to raise funds for Democrats . 
Huang has come under fire over the legality of contributions he helped solicit as vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee &apos;s finance arm but the lawsuit does not relate to those activities . 
Keeney said the questioning of Huang should be restricted to the period from July 18 , 1994 to Dec . 4 , 1995 , when he worked at the Commerce Department , and should cover only the adequacy of the search for documents . 
he also asked that a federal magistrate be present and that the questioning take place at the Courthouse , not Judicial Watch &apos;s office . 
the judge said he would rule on the request on Monday . 
Larry Klayman , the group &apos;s general counsel , denied charges by a DNC official that the latest developments were an effort by an extreme right-wing group acting for political purpose . 
&quot; We are not looking to grandstand the deposition , &quot; he said . 
but government lawyer Bruce Hegyi said during the hearing that Klayman in other depositions strayed far from the issues in the case , even asking a secretary about cookies she once received as a birthday present .
