U.S. treasuries ended higher on Tuesday , buoyed by a solid two-year note auction and hopes for an agreement between the Clinton administration and Republican leaders on a balanced budget . 
the bellwether 6.625 percent 30-year Treasury bond settled up 18 / 32 at 94-26 / 32 to yield 7.04 percent . 
by the close of trading , the new two-year benchmark was yielding 6.44 percent . 
&quot; The auction was good and there is still some lingering talk that there &apos;s a budget deal coming to the surface , &quot; said Tom O &apos;Connell , a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc . 
treasuries traded lower before the results of the Treasury &apos;s $ 17.0 billion two-year note sale were released , but gained in their aftermath , pushing to session highs in the afternoon . 
Treasury sold the notes at a high yield of 6.46 percent , awarding 49 percent of bids at the high rate . 
the bid-to-cover ratio -- a gauge of investor demand -- came in at a solid 2.43 , while non-competitive bids totalled $ 1.312 billion . 
dealers cited good interest from arbitrageurs but little retail demand for the notes . 
&quot; It came in on the firm side of expectations , &quot; said Josh stiles , senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A. 
Inc . &quot; But I think the results of the two-year say very little about the prospects for the five-year sale . 
on Wednesday , the Treasury will follow up its two-year sale with a $ 12.5 billion auction of five-year notes . 
talk of a balanced budget agreement filtered through the market in the afternoon following a Market News Service report which quoted Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott as saying Republicans and the White House were &quot; very close &quot; to an agreement on several big policy issues . 
and in the late afternoon , a spokesman at the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) said that President Clinton would meet with Congressional Democrats on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss efforts to reach a five-year pact on balancing the budget . 
analysts remained skeptical of prospects for a near-term pact but said the market rumors were keeping shorts nervous and lending the long-end of the Treasury curve a modest bid . 
&quot; The budget rumors have done a lot to fuel a slow grind up all day , &quot; said a head governments trader at a major European bank in New York . 
but without any major data releases on Tuesday , volume remained relatively low for a second consecutive session . 
analysts said the market was uninspired by weekly retail sales data . 
the BTM / Schroders weekly chain store sales index showed a 0.2 percent rise in the week ended April 19 , while the Redbook Research Service reported a 0.5 percent jump in retail sales for the period ending April 19 . 
a report by CNW Marketing / Research showing that U.S. auto sales fell 1.4 percent in the period of April 11 through April 20 compared to the prior year also had little market impact . 
&quot; We &apos;ve kind of reached an equilibrium point in the market for the near-term until we see how the five-year note sale goes tomorrow , &quot; said Richard Schwarz , short-governments trader at Zions First National Bank Capital Markets . 
analysts said another supportive element for treasuries on Tuesday was a whopping 173 point rise in the Dow industrial average -- the second largest gain in history . 
three-month bills rates ended down one basis point at 5.20 percent , six-month bills rates settled unchanged at 5.37 percent and year-bill rates ended up one basis point at 5.62 percent . 
the Treasury &apos;s bellwether five-year note ended up 3 / 32 at 99-18 / 32 to yield 6.73 percent and its ten-year note settled 7 / 32 higher at 95-27 / 32 to yield 6.84 percent .
