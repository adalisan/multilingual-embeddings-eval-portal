a surprising dip in factory output measured by the National Association of Purchasing Management in September supports forecasts for softer overall U.S. economic growth in the third quarter , analysts said . 
the NAPM reported its index of manufacturing activity slipped to 51.7 percent in September from 52.6 in August , slightly lower than a Reuters poll consensus forecast ot 52.5 . 
while NAPM &apos;s prices index rose to 51.2 from 47.4 , dealers said declines in supplier deliveries and inventories components plus weak employment offset any inflation worries . 
&quot; The report shows the manufacturing sector is just muddling through , &quot; said Elliott Platt , research director at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette . 
the bond market enjoyed a modest rally after the report , with investors focusing on its weaker economic signals . 
many analysts see U.S. economic growth slowing toward 2.0 percent from a second-quarter reading at 4.7 percent , reining in inflation and staying a hike in short-term interest rates . 
&quot; The inflation signals are basically a wash and the market is doing better on the soft economic data &quot; in the report , said Alan Levenson , money market economist at UBS Securities . 
NAPM &apos;s supplier deliveries index fell to 49.7 percent from 52.5 , indicating faster delivery performance for the first time in five months . 
that indicator , considered a key inflation gauge for Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , should help minimize inflation pressure and the likelihood of imminent Fed rate hikes , Platt said . 
&quot; While prices went up , the supplier delivery component is a little bit of an offset , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s one of Greenspan &apos;s favorite indicators . 
he uses it as a forecast tool for upcoming Producer Price Index inflation . 
the NAPM employment index fell to 46.9 percent from 48.2 , indicating 20 consecutive months of declining manufacturing employment , according to the report . 
that would suggest the manufacturing sector will not exacerbate recent Labor market tightness seen in other segments of the economy that has produced worrisome signs of rising wage pressure , analysts said . 
&quot; We should have a continuation of little , if any , gain in employment in the manufacturing sector and probably 0.2 or 0.3 percent monthly gains in industrial production in the fourth quarter , &quot; Platt said . 
Platt also said he sees real GDP growth in the 1.5-1.7 percent range over the third and fourth quarter . 
that would be good news for the bond market , where some traders are beginning to wonder if the Fed will ratchet up rates this fall , a conclusion that seemed all but certain until the September 24 Federal Open Market Committee meeting . 
NAPM &apos;s weakness appears to argue for more patience from the Fed , analysts said . 
&quot; NAPM &apos;s prices were up , but the falling real sector data show us the economy is weakening , &quot; Levenson said .
