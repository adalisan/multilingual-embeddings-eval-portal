Italian champions Juventus have signed serie A top goalscorer Filippo Inzaghin from Atalanta , Ansa news agency reported on Tuesday . 
it said the deal , which also involved Parma as holders of the papers of the Italian squad member who played a season for them before being parked with Atalanta , was agreed in Milan and had been confirmed by a Juventus spokesman . 
the report could not be independently verified . 
Italian newspapers had reported that Inzaghi could be heading for Atletico Madrid , who had reportedly made a hefty offer for Inzaghi . 
he made his serie A debut in 1995 for Parma against Atalanta . 
he scored 24 goals for Atalanta in a season which ended with Juventus as champions and Parma runners-up . 
&quot; If I had to decide for purely economic reasons I would already have signed for the Spanish club , &quot; the Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper quoted him as saying on Tuesday . 
Atletico had reportedly turned their attentions to Inzaghi after a bid for Juventus striker Christian Vieri , another Italian squad member , was rejected by the Turin club . 
Inzaghi &apos;s arrival at Juventus would inevitably mean the deaprture of one of their existing strikers , with the odds most stacked against Croatian international Alen Boksic . 
Boksic , who joined from Lazio last season , has been reportedly courted by Real Madrid , Barcelona , Manchester United , and Glasgow Rangers as well as some Italian clubs .
