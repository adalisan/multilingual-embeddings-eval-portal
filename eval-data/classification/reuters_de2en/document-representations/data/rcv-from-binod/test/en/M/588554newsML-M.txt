Singapore product swaps at midday Thursday were little moved from Wednesday but sentiment on gas oil remained bearish , traders said . 
June gas oil swaps were last quoted at $ 24.90 / $ 25.05 per barrel and July at $ 24.70 / $ 25.00 -- both steady on late Wednesday . 
while swaps quotes were steady , traders expected levels to come under pressure later Thursday over worries about unsold supplies in the physical market . 
traders said up to 150,000 tonnes of arbitrage supplies are seeking buyers . 
they said the lack of near term support , may cause prices to fall sharply . 
but some sellers remained optimistic . 
&quot; Local traders who had recently purchased huge volumes of gas oil would not let the prices fall that easily , &quot; said one potential seller . 
fuel oil was last quoted at $ 101.25 / $ 102.50 , also little moved from Wednesday quotes . 
traders were expecting fuel oil swaps to rise , citing good buying support in the cash market with reduce seasonal supplies from the Middle east . 
brokers said the crude markets have provided little direction to guide swaps quotes .
