Argyle diamond mine partner Ashton Mining Ltd said on Tuesday Argyle diamond production for the three months to December 31 was 9.45 million carats , taking calendar 1996 output to total 41.99 million carats , up five percent on 1995 . 
&quot; Full year AK1 ( main Argyle pipe ) diamond production exceeded 1995 levels , reflecting increased plant throughput , &quot; the company said in a production report . 
Argyle , the world &apos;s biggest diamond mine , is owned 60 percent by RTZ-CRA and 40 percent by Ashton . 
Ashton also said its first six months of diamond sales outside De Beers &apos; Central Selling Organisation ( CSO ) were in line with forecasts and a strong presence in the key Antwerp market had been established . 
&quot; Argyle is confident that this will provide a strong base for expanded sales throughout the 1997 year , &quot; the company said . 
the company did not report sales figures for the year . 
Argyle , which produces mainly small , low quality stones , split from the CSO in June last year , challenging its global authority . 
Ashton &apos;s 90 percent-owned Reguibat Shield Joint Venture in Mauritania would continue exploration after finding encouraging diamond indicator results in 1995 , Ashton said . 
sampling and further analysis of Burkina Faso properties would continue in the current quarter , Ashton said . 
Ashton , which is about 46.9 percent owned by Malaysia Mining Corp Bhd , said it was hopeful three long-standing diamond exploration applications in India would be approved soon , following changes to Indian prospecting laws .
