Austria &apos;s current account deficit may grow slower later this year thanks to soaring dollar , but it will remain under pressure from long-term structural problems such as flagging tourism , experts say . 
the current account deficit widened by 6.2 billion schillings ( $ 466.7 million ) to 28.7 billion ( $ 2.2 billion ) in the first half of this year , according to National Bank statistics released on Thursday . 
the bank said a poor first quarter was to blame for the deterioration and that there was some improvement in the second quarter . 
an expected rise in exports should help ease the pinch in the current account for the full year , it added . 
Jan Stankovsky , expert at WIFO economic research institute , said he would either retain his full year forecast at 44 billion schillings or revise it slightly downwards . 
&quot; The strength of the dollar is gift of God for Austria in its present situation which will certainly contribute to easing the deficit problem , &quot; he said . 
however , a continuing decline in Austria &apos;s tourism industry , traditionally the backbone of its economy , plus contributions to the European Union , would continue to put pressure on the current account , he noted . 
Austria , which joined the EU in 1995 , transferred 15 billion schillings to EU coffers in the first half of 1997 and received about eight billion schillings in revenue . 
&quot; The firming of exports will reduce a big part of the current account problem in the short-term . 
but the tourism problem is structural and the only immediate solution is more exports of goods and services , &quot; Stankovsky said . 
he said the government &apos;s recently-launched export offensive concentrating on technology development had so far failed to yield noticeable results . 
economists say though that promoting technology and the exports sector , coupled with lifting bureaucratic barriers and trimming wage costs , would help in the long-term . 
the Alpine republic has been faced with a negative current account balance for the past three years , mainly due to a sharp decline in the number domestic and foreign visitors . 
the high tourism surplus of the past has declined to a point where it can no longer cover the deficit in the trade balance , analysts said . 
the National Bank said the tourism surplus had dropped by 2.5 billion schillings to 15 billion in the first half . 
spending by incoming tourists rose by two percent . 
Austrians &apos; spending on holidays abroad rose by seven percent . 
the current account problem could only be successfully addressed through long-term measures , he said .
