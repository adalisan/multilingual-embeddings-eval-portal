wall Street economists have upped their forecasts for a key report on the nation &apos;s manufacturing economy in August after a regional factories index showed tremendous strength . 
preliminary results of a Reuters survey point to a reading of 52.5 in the month compared to 50.2 in July . 
a reading above 50 suggests an expanding manufacturing sector , while a reading below that mark indicates a contracting factory economy . 
&quot; We had 52 , and I think we &apos;ll revise up to 53 , but 54 would not shock me , &quot; said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc , of his NAPM forecast . 
Moran was one of several experts to pump up his forecast after the Chicago Purchasing Managers Association reported its regional manufacturing index at 60 in August , up almost nine points from the previous month &apos;s reading of 51.2 . 
the Chicago index is often viewed as a precursor to the national report released a day or two later . 
but Moran offered a word of caution about the Chicago report .
