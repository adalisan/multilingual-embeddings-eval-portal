Chilean blue chips withered on Tuesday amid fears of a currency devaluation in Brazil , ending nearly two percent lower , brokers said . 
the IPSA index of the 40 most-traded shares followed other regional indices down , closing 1.92 percent off at 131.25 points . 
after steady gains during the past few weeks , the bourse was ripe for a reversal , but concerns about Brazil made it steeper than it might otherwise have been , brokers said . 
&quot; The news from Brazil made people nervous but to some extent it really only accentuated a natural correction in prices , &quot; one broker said . 
Brazilian officials denied they were planning a devaluation or any changes to the existing foreign currency regime , despite fears that foreign exchange woes affecting some Asian economies would spread to Brazil . 
the IPSA &apos;s decline , on paltry volume of 9.7 billion pesos , came despite comments by Central Bank President Carlos Massad that fresh data would show May year-over-year economic growth of five percent and continued low inflation . 
shares in the big-volume electrical sector were especially hard hit .
