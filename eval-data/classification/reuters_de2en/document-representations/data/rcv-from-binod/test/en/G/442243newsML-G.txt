Turkmenistan , the last stop on the NATO secretary-general &apos;s tour of Central Asia , said on Friday it did not mind NATO &apos;s expansion eastwards but said Russia , a critic of NATO plans , remained its strategic partner . 
&quot; We are not worried by NATO &apos;s expansion westwards or eastwards , &quot; Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov told reporters before meeting NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana . 
but a foreign ministry spokesman said : &quot; Turkmenistan follows the principles of neutrality and defence sufficiency , being backed by its strategic partner -- Russia -- in issues of guarding the lengthy border with Afghanistan and Iran . 
Solana arrived in the former Soviet republic early on Friday , ending his five-day tour of four Central Asian states . 
the tour appears to be an attempt to convince these ex-Soviet states that NATO &apos;s sparring with the Kremlin over its planned eastward enlargement does not threaten stability in their own countries . 
Solana also discussed with Central Asian leaders NATO &apos;s plan to set up a new partnership with ex-communist states -- the Atlantic Partnership Council -- which is expected to take over the Partnership for Peace programme created in 1994 to fill the security vacuum following the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
&quot; Turkmenistan refers with understanding to changes within NATO and its peace-making role , &quot; Niyazov said . 
Niyazov &apos;s words echoed the position of neighbouring Uzbekistan visited by Solana on Thursday . 
Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov told a news conference late on Thursday his country did not accept Russia &apos;s critical stance . 
&quot; We think that alliance or non-alliance of any state with this or that organisation is its sovereign right , &quot; Kamilov said . 
but the two other Central Asian states visited by Solana -- Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan -- share a different view . 
&quot; We share Russia &apos;s concerns about NATO &apos;s enlargement , &quot; Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev told Solana on Wednesday . 
Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev told reporters during Solana &apos;s visit on Tuesday , &quot; the process of expansion is inevitable but it is important to heed Russia &apos;s concerns &quot; . 
Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan plan to hold a joint 10-day regional peacekeeping exercise with NATO in September .
