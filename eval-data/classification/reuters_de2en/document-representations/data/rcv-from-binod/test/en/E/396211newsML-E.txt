the Malaysian economy grew by 8.2 percent in 1996 for its ninth straight year of above eight percent growth , the government announced on Saturday . 
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the country &apos;s current account deficit has also improved , narrowing to 11.0 billion ringgit ( $ 4.44 billion ) last year from 18.7 billion in 1995 . 
he told reporters after a meeting of the National Finance Council that the merchandise trade balance was at a surplus of 9.1 billion ringgit against a 233 million surplus in 1995 . 
&quot; These figures are reassuring but that does not mean that we should be complacent . 
we will have to take up measures ... like the need to promote savings , the need to continue to be prudent in our economic management , and the need to encourage exports , &quot; Anwar said . 
when asked about gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth for 1997 , he said the growth &quot; will continue to be sustainable &quot; . 
the government has previously forecast that GDP will top 8.0 percent this year , as it tries to apply some brakes to the economic boom . 
the surging economy , which grew 9.5 percent in 1995 , had raised concerns of economic overheating . 
Anwar said total exports in 1996 rose 6.4 percent to 191.0 billion ringgit , while imports rose 1.5 percent to 181.9 billion . 
the manufacturing sector was the main contributor to the economic growth , expanding by 12.2 percent in 1996 , followed by the services sector which grew 9.4 percent and construction &apos;s 9.0 percent growth . 
economists said while the GDP growth of 8.2 percent was in line with their expectations , the current account gap was narrower-than-expected . 
the government had forecast GDP growth of 8.2 percent for 1996 , while the current account was projected to be in deficit of 14.77 billion ringgit . 
economists said the narrower current account gap was positive for the stockmarket . 
&quot; I think the market should be encouraged by the current account . 
economic growth is maintained , the current account has improved so much , &quot; said Liew Yin Sze , chief economist at brokerage J.M. 
Sassoon &amp; Co . 
but he said the economic boom will keep up the flow of imported goods and pressure the gap of the current account balance to balloon again . 
&quot; Because domestic demand is still strong , imports can &apos;t stay low . 
exports are going to surge again , &quot; said Liew . 
the government has forecast a current account deficit of 11.5 billion ringgit in 1997 . 
while Anwar did not release Malaysia &apos;s external trade data for December 1996 , economists said the jump in the merchandise trade surplus pointed to a positive data for the month . 
for the first 11 months of 1996 , Malaysia recorded an improvement in overall external trade balance , with the deficit at 1.5 billion ringgit from a shortfall of 8.5 billion in the same period in 1995 .
