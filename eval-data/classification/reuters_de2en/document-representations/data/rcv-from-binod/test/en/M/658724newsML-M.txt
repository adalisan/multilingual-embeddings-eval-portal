Central and east European 
bourses had mixed fortunes this week with Warsaw and Prague 
leading the gainers and Slovak and Romanian share indices 
falling back sharply . 
Budapest ended a run of spectacular gains with a widely 
predicted correction in mid-week . 
Ljubliana saw moderate losses 
and Croatian shares picked up though analysts forecast 
stagnation in both markets with few fresh factors seen . 
price movements in 72 Czech , Hungarian , Polish , Slovak and 
Slovenian shares , moved higher . 
Czech shares edged slightly higher in a week dominated by a 
parliamentary confidence vote in the centre-right coalition 
government which to the relief of many investors , the 
government won . 
as tension surrounding the vote receded , dealers said the 
market would now redirect its sights to more fundamental 
economic issues such as government promises to regulate the 
capital markets and rein in the budget deficit . 
&quot; Now it is time to get back to work and clean up the 
markets , stop corruption ... it is the government &apos;s job to do 
this , &quot; said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company . 
analysts said the pace of growth was likely to slow with 
trading reverting back to the long term flat trend it has been 
on for several weeks . 
analysts said investor attention was likely to focus on the 
privatisation scheme , which started trading on the bourse on 
Thursday . 
suspect investors will start selling soon and the market &apos;s 
attention will shift to NFIs , &quot; said Dariusz Szepieniec , an 
analyst at Bank Slaski brokerage . 
analysts said bourse sentiment was likely to remain 
overshadowed by the prospect of large privatisations and 
general elections due in September . 
Hungarian shares began the week in bullish mood pushing the 
Monday . 
but a two-day correction pulled prices down sharply before 
points . 
traders said Hungarian shares were likely to be stable for 
the next few weeks , but added that the long-term outlook 
remains positive .

the announcement of new portfolio investment rules sent 
turnover to consecutive all-time highs on Wednesday and 
Thursday but the two main indices fell sharply . 
earlier this week , Romania set a 1.5 percent tax on each 
portfolio buying deal , amending previous portfolio flow rules 
which set a four percent fee on capital gains . 
expecting little change until there is a resolution to the 
current uncertainty surrounding the Slovak crown . 
&quot; The decline is fuelled mainly by fears of a Slovak crown 
devaluation , but also the start of a listless summer season 
seems to be playing its role , &quot; said Dusan Sykora of ING 
Barings . 
Sykora said he did not expect a reversal of the downtrend 
or a significant improvement in liquidity for at least two 
months . 
&quot; The index might not significantly fall further , but in a 
wider perspective , the downtrend will be still visible at least 
by the end of the summer , &quot; he said . 
in Slovenia , prices and volumes fell with traders 
predicting a quiet summer season in the absence of any fresh 
factors to boost the market . 
market participants said future movements would largely 
was signed in June last year . 
most Croatian stocks picked up this week amid stronger 
buying activity which was driven by foreign investors , but the 
market was seen drifting sideways in the absence of fresh 
factors . 
Zagrebacka Banka stole the spotlight , trading in large 
volumes , after it dropped to the 2,070-2,050 kuna level . 
its 
price was expected to firm in the near term after a forecast 
12-percent increase in net parent earnings this year . 
drugs firm Pliva recovered , but traders said it was a 
likely to hover around 460 kuna for a while .
