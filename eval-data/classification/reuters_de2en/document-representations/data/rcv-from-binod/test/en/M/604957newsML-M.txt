the response to Lithuania &apos;s launch of long-term Treasury bills will be a key test of the market &apos;s confidence in the government &apos;s plans to gradually scrap the country &apos;s currency board , analysts say . 
the country &apos;s finance ministry plans to diversify its debt market and introduce two-year T-bills in September and paper with a five-year maturity early next year . 
maturities currently run from one month to one year . 
the move to longer maturities coincides with the central bank &apos;s transition to a more active monetary policy and the elimination of the currency board . 
under the system , adopted in 1994 with the blessing of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the country &apos;s central bank guarantees that it will have one dollar in reserve for every four litas in circulation , freezing the exchange rate at that level . 
the system has kept the currency rigidly stable , a fact not lost on investors , who have found Lithuania &apos;s domestic debt market attractive . 
yields have been falling recently and have stabilised in the nine to ten percent range . 
but the longer maturities will be the first real test of the market &apos;s take on the government &apos;s currency plans . 
&quot; We are not expecting that at the first auction there would be a very good price for the issue ... it is just to open the way for the next issue , &quot; Arvydas Kregzde , director of the central bank &apos;s market operations department , told Reuters . 
after sweeping into power in last autumn &apos;s parliamentary elections , Lithuania &apos;s centre-right government had trouble convincing currency and debt markets that the litas would stay stable during the return to a central bank system . 
to calm fears , the government and central bank have stressed the incremental nature of their plans . 
the dollar peg is not seen being changed before 1999 . 
according to officials , the peg may at that point be &quot; revised &quot; to include EU currencies alongside the dollar . 
the central bank says that confidence in its plans can be seen in the growing popularity of longer-term T-bills . 
&quot; At first it was mostly one-month T-bills , and now the most popular are the six-month T-bills , &quot; Kregzde said . 
but as the Czech crown takes a pounding , not all investors are convinced that the litas can stand without the support of the currency board . 
&quot; It ( long-term Lithuanian T-bills ) is certainly not a safe investment for an investor like me , &quot; said Kristjan Hanni , head of asset management at Estonia &apos;s Hoiupank . 
others say they have been reassured by the central bank and are positive about Lithuania &apos;s long-term prospects . 
&quot; We have heard from the central bank that the exit from the currency board will be handled in the right way , &quot; said Henri Malvet , assistant vice president of Finland &apos;s Merita Bank Ltd . 
&quot; Of course there is a risk , but if there is a higher risk on T-bills , there is also a higher reward , &quot; said Piotr Borovski , director of Poland &apos;s Kredyt Bank S.A. &quot; I think investors can accept the risks in Lithuania . 
according to a key Western observer , the switch from the currency board may actually leave many aspects of monetary policy unchanged . 
&quot; Practically , they are going to maintain the same policies as they have now , &quot; Fanizza added .
