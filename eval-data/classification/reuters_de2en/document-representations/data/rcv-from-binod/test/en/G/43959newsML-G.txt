the publisher of the classic 1960s song &quot; Soul Man &quot; has written the campaign of Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole asking that it stop using the song , an official of the company said on Tuesday . 
&quot; He has taken the song &apos; Soul Man &apos; and , without permission , changed the lyrics to &apos; Dole Man &apos; and is using it to promote his campaign , &quot; Mary Lee Ryan , vice president for business affairs of Rondor Music International , said . 
the writers &quot; are not happy with his use of the song , &quot; she said . 
2 pop hit in 1967 for the Stax Records act Sam and Dave , &quot; Soul Man &quot; was written by Isaac Hayes and David Porter . 
the Dole / Kemp campaign could be liable for statutory damages of $ 100,000 for each unauthorised use of the composition as well as legal costs . 
the song has been used extensively in the campaign , Ryan said . 
Rondor gave Dole until Friday to resolve the problem , she said . 
&quot; I will consider ( suing ) in the context of what his response is , &quot; she said . 
it &apos;s going to depend on what response , if any , we get . 
the letter , dated Aug . 29 , said , &quot; We find it particularly shocking that someone who aspires to hold the highest elected office in this country would so flagrantly disregard the exclusive rights granted to authors by the U.S. 
Constitution . 
the letter went on to say , &quot; Your use of our property conveys the false implication that the authors ... endorse your campaign , which gives rise to claims under the Lanham Act . 
Congress passed the Lanham Act in 1946 to provide for federal registration of trademarks and their protection against infringement . 
under copyright law , users of derivative works , with the same music as an original but different lyrics , must pay royalties to the original composers . 
the letter said the use of the song in a political campaign could have a &quot; devastating impact &quot; on its value . 
the Dole / Kemp campaign has not yet responded , Ryan said .
