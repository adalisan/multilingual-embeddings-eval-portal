following is a selection of economists &apos; reactions to data showing a UK public sector surplus of 36 billion stg in April . 
the consensus forecast was for a deficit of 1.7 billion . 
&quot; The PSBR is clearly on an improving trend despite the distortion in today &apos;s figures . 
&quot; They are a good set of numbers even when you strip out the receipts from the mod and from the housing corporation loan book . 
I think it continues the trend we &apos;ve seen over the last year of growth coming in above forecast and unemployment coming in above forecast and surprisingly good control of departmental spending . 
&quot; The question is to what extent will the Chancellor be able to trim the PSBR forecast for the next three years and to what extent will there be further fiscal tightening which will help that process .
