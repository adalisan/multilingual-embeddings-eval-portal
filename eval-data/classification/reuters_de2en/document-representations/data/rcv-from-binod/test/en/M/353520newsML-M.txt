physical nickel business in Europe has cooled off after stronger activity in early January but scrap availability remains tight and Russian premiums are firmer , traders and industry sources said . 
&quot; Volume picked up definitely in January , but the last two weeks have been a lot quieter , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; There &apos;s a slightly firmer tone around , but last year we had the New Year euphoria , then it waned a bit in February and died for the rest of the year . 
traders said there had been scant consumer involvement in the run-up in LME three month prices to 4-1 / 2 month highs that peaked at $ 7,740 on Monday , a 20 percent rise since the New Year . 
&quot; Personally I think all the consumers who had to buy on a long-term basis are already covered , &quot; another trader in Europe said . 
Russian material has been increasingly difficult to come by , but it was unclear what was behind the tightness . 
severe winter conditions in January may have interrupted collection and shipment of secondary and some raw material , an industry source said . 
but this was dismissed by another trader , who said a reorganisation at Norilsk nickel has disrupted distribution channels for Russian metal . 
&quot; Russian discounts are certainly well in from the level you were seeing before Christmas , &quot; the industry source said . 
spot Russian uncut metal was being offered in Europe for as much as $ 50 per tonne below LME cash , but at least one trader said this was an unrealistic level . 
&quot; The final consumer is not ready to pay that , &quot; the trader said . 
quotes ranged from $ 50 to $ 90 , depending on the size of the order , compared to $ 80 to $ 130 last November . 
scrap was also less available , with nickel-in-scrap as a ratio of LME cash quoted at 93 to 95 percent versus 90 percent in November and as little as 80 percent at one point last year . 
&quot; Current scrap tightness suggests that stainless producers will increasingly to looking to supplement with primary nickel , &quot; said analyst Larry Kaplan of Flemings Global Mining Group . 
Western material was scarce with much of the material tied up in direct producer-consumer deals , but premiums were largely unchanged over the last few months . 
&quot; The premiums are whatever you can get , especially for certain specialist forms for the plating industry , &quot; an industry source said . 
uncut cathode , from producers such as Falconbridge or INCO , was quoted at $ 300- $ 325 over LME cash . 
but cut material commanded premiums of $ 450- $ 500 , one trader said . 
another said he had done a deal recently for one-by-ones at 26 cents / lb ( $ 573 per tonne ) over LME cash . 
premiums were higher in North America , traders said . 
looking ahead , traders said they expected nickel to live up to its volatile reputation and could provoke some panic buying if speculators run prices higher , with one pegging $ 7,800 basis LME three months as a key level . 
&quot; I think it will eventually get tighter but I think it &apos;s going to be a choppy year and not go into sustained tightness , &quot; one said .
