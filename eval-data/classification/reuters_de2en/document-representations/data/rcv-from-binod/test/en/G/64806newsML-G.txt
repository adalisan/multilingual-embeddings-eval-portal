U.N. special envoy Norbert Holl said on Thursday that recent military moves in Afghanistan might make some factions less willing to talk peace . 
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that the military situation has damaged hopes we had that we had reached some kind of stalemate or &apos; balance of frustrations &apos; , &quot; he told foreign correspondents in Islamabad . 
he said it might be that only if all sides were equally frustrated could peace initiatives stand a chance of success . 
&quot; Now with the reinvigoration of military actions and the change in the political landscape in favour of the Taleban , it &apos;s easy to see that the Taleban for the time being feel less inclined to join any U.N. initiative , &quot; he said . 
the Taleban captured the eastern city of Jalalabad last week , expanding their territory and tightening their grip on the Afghan capital , already under siege from the south . 
Holl said the United Nations believed that progress towards peace was urgent , not least because foreign donors might prove unwilling to fund relief and reconstruction if they felt the Afghans preferred fighting to rebuilding their country . 
Holl , a German diplomat who has spent two months in his post , said he hoped to expand contacts with the Taleban . 
&quot; I have a feeling there is a lack of dialogue with the Taleban . 
we know too little about them , &quot; he said . 
he said that Afghan political leaders were not keen on the idea of a federal solution for their fragmented land , divided increasingly on ethnic lines , preferring a loose central state . 
the United Nations was committed to maintaining the territorial integrity of a founder-member . 
&quot; If Afghanistan fell apart , I can &apos;t predict the consequences for the region , &quot; he said .
