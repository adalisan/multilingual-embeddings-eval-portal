Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko &apos;s party said on Tuesday it was ready to share power ahead of elections with Laurent Kabila &apos;s rebels who have siezed about a quarter of the country since fighting started in October . 
&quot; We shall meet and after dialogue we will share power , &quot; Banza Mukalayi , vice-chairman of Mobutu &apos;s Popular Revolutionary Movement ( MPR ) , told Reuters in Kinshasa . 
his comments went much further than previous signs that the ailing Mobutu and his party were ready to seek a deal with Kabila &apos;s Tutsi-dominated rebels . 
&quot; First we will talk to find the mechanism for a ceasefire and then we will share power before elections , &quot; Banza said . 
under Mobutu &apos;s laborious and grudging moves towards democracy after 32 years in power , Zaire is supposed to hold its first real multiparty elections by July . 
both sides are under mounting pressure to stop the civil war , agree a ceasefire and enter negotiations . 
on Monday Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo resigned after Mobutu essentially backed a disputed vote by the transitional parliament to oust Kengo . 
the pressure to end the fighting will intensify at an African summit in the Togolese capital Lome on Wednesday attended by the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , who said he hoped progress could be made towards resolving the conflict . 
&quot; The Zairean government has insisted that a ceasefire take place before talks can begin , and Kabila has said that talks must proceed before there is a ceasefire , &quot; Annan told a news conference in the Angolan capital Luanda . 
&quot; I hope that in Lome we will find a basis for moving forward by perhaps having a ceasefire and talks begin simultaneously . 
a top U.N. official travelling with Annan said he expected high-level talks in Lome to start immediately . 
&quot; It will either be Kabila himself who will talk to some of Mobutu &apos;s people or it will be Kabila &apos;s top representatives who will meet with them , &quot; the official said . 
the rebels are still about 1,000 km ( 600 miles ) east of Kinshasa but they have mineral-rich Shaba province in their sights and so far Zaire &apos;s ragged army has failed to put up a fight . 
South African sources said Kabila had dropped a demand for direct talks with Mobutu and agreed to negotiate with a team appointed by the 66-year-old president . 
but the government sources , close to South African mediation in the Zaire crisis , told Reuters Kabila was only prepared to negotiate once and the outcome had to be conclusive . 
neither the rebels nor Mobutu &apos;s camp commented on the report . 
South African envoys who met Mobutu in Kinshasa on Sunday said he would reply to the new peace ideas within 48 hours . 
the deadline was Tuesday night and Zaire &apos;s state television said on Tuesday the president &apos;s spokesman , Kabuya Lumuna , would make a statement on Mobutu &apos;s behalf in the evening . 
Mobutu and Kabila have both sent teams to Lome for the special Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) summit . 
senior American and French officials , seeking to overcome arguments in Africa and forge a common policy to prevent Zaire breaking up , were in Lome for the talks . 
the new Franco-American joint effort on Zaire was evident in Brazzaville on Tuesday where about 1,000 troops from the two allies and Belgium were camped at the airport . 
the force was being readied to cross the Zaire river to neighbouring Kinshasa and evacuate thousands of Westerners from Zaire if the crisis degenerated . 
Kinshasa was calm on Tuesday but the sprawling city of about three million people was intently following confusing political developments . 
the failure to win the war or arrange a peace cost the prime minister his job but Kengo and his government remain in office until a successor is found -- a potentially lengthy process despite the critical hour . 
opposition parties in the transitional parliament must pick a candidate , for Mobutu &apos;s approval , but at a meeting on Tuesday some argued that Kabila join negotiations before a new government was formed . 
&quot; We must incorporate the rebels in all consultations . 
there is no point in forming a government that may only last a matter of days , &quot; said engineer Dyongo , an opposition member . 
&quot; Mobutu is trying to save his own skin . 
we cannot have a government in Kinshasa when we don &apos;t know how much territory Kinshasa will control tomorrow , &quot; he added . 
in Cape Town , Sadako Ogata , head of the U.N. refugee agency , criticised the international community over Zaire and called for an African rapid intervention force to intervene in conflicts . 
some 400,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees are unaccounted for in Zaire since fleeing when civil war began last October .
