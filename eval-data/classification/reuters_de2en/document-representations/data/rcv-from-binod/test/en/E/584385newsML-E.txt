the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of Australian consumer sentiment fell 2.9 points or 2.8 percent in May to 102.5 from 105.4 . 
&quot; It &apos;s not surprising consumer sentiment has fallen in May . 
the survey was conducted on the weekend prior to yesterday &apos;s announcement of the federal government &apos;s budget , &quot; said Bill Evans , general manager of economics at Westpac . 
Evans also noted that in the past two years sentiment has fallen by 2.8 and 7.7 percent respectively in the lead-up to the budget . 
&quot; It appears consumers are traditionally influenced by expectations of tough spending cuts in the lead up to the government budget announcements , &quot; Evans said . 
&quot; While there was very little advanced knowledge of the contents of the budget , concern was heightened given the 1996 / 97 Budget position had recently been announced to have deteriorated by A $ 3.0 billion , &quot; Evans said . 
Evans noted that in contrast with last year &apos;s budget which delivered substantial spending cuts , savings were been relatively minor in the 1997 / 98 budget . 
he said he believed consumer sentiment was likely to improve in next month &apos;s survey given that there have been no significant spending cuts . 
about 80 percent of the savings over the four years from the budget will be generated by interest savings and the scrapping of the planned superannuation co-contribution . 
Evans also said sentiment should improve on the announcement of a new savings rebate . 
&quot; sentiment is also driven by employment prospects , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The government is forecasting a solid rebound in employment in 1997 / 98 and a fall in the unemployment rate to 8.0 percent . 
Evans said Westpac broadly agreed with that outlook and expected most of the growth would come in full time jobs and that any resultant lift in consumer confidence would help reinforce the recovery and , in particular , encourage consumers to resume spending . 
&quot; Given that the budget keeps fiscal policy on track towards a surplus in 1998 / 99 , it will assist in holding down interest rates even in an environment of improving growth and moderately higher inflation , &quot; Evans said . 
&quot; Westpac maintains the view that there will be no change in Reserve Bank interest rate until before at least the middle of 1998 , &quot; he added .
