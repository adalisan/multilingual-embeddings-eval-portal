Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Tuesday held an earlier-than-expected meeting with union leaders to discuss the government &apos;s forthcoming three-year rolling programme of economic targets , news agencies said . 
Prodi &apos;s spokesman and Italy &apos;s three main trades union confederations , CGIL , CISL and UIL were unavailable for comment on the reports , which said Prodi had called the union leaders to a meeting at an undisclosed location outside government offices . 
they said Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi , Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni , Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco , Labour Minister Tiziano Treu and Cabinet Undersecretary Enrico Micheli were also present . 
there were no immediate details of the talks , which centred on the economic document for the next three years , known as the DPEF , which the government is expected to unveil on Friday . 
Prodi &apos;s centre-left government awaits a rough ride from unions over plans to reform the welfare and pensions system . 
the government &apos;s main concern is to curtail so-called length of service pensions , which entitle some Italians to draw state pensions after only 30 years of contributions . 
&quot; We can make sacrifices , but there is a limit , &quot; cautioned Guglielmo Epifani , the number two at the CGIL confederation , earlier on Tuesday . 
Prodi had not been due to meet the union leaders until Thursday , one day before the cabinet is expected to approve the DPEF . 
pushing through a credible DPEF , which will also spell out Italy &apos;s deficit-cutting plans for 1998 , is seen as vital to Prodi &apos;s hopes of joining a single European currency .
