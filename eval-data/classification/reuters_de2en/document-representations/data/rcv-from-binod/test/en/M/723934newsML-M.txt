the Indonesian rupiah stabilised against the dollar at mid-morning on Friday after being jolted briefly by the Philippine peso , dealers said . 
they said the market seemed to have calmed down for now and offshore operators were seen cashing out from high dollars . 
&quot; We see some dollar selling . 
I think offshore operators are taking profits as there is no problem with the rupiah , &quot; one European bank dealer said . 
the dealer said he felt selling interest was also emerging in the swap market which rose sharply on the peso spillover . 
&quot; Some operators think we are in the same region , so it &apos;s better to cover first before anything happens , causing spot rupiah rates to decline and swaps to rise , &quot; another said . 
&quot; But after realising Indonesia has different economic fundamentals , they start to reverse positions , &quot; he said . 
spot rupiah settled at around 2,434.50 / 35.25 at 0300 GMT against an early low of 2,437.0 . 
it opened at 2,432.5 / 33.5 . 
tomorrow and today rupiah were at 2,434.1 / 34.9 and 2,432.4 / 33.5 , respectively . 
dealers said liquidity was stable , with overnight money trading at around 12.0 / 13.0 percent . 
the Philippines Central Bank said on Friday that it would allow the peso to move in a wider range against the dollar , a move traders said amounted to the second de facto devaluation of an Asian currency this month . 
Thailand floated the baht last week . 
overnight swap was at 1.1 / 1.2 and Tom / next at 0.35 / 0.40 . 
one-month swap was at 16.0 / 16.5 , two at 30.0 / 32.0 , three at 46.0 / 48.0 and six at 94.0 / 96.0 points . 
the central bank raised its intervention band by one point to 2,430 / 2,622 and the conversion band also by one point to 2,430 / 2,478 on Thursday .
