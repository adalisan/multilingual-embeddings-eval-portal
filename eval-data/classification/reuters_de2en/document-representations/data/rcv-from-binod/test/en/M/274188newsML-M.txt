Indonesian palm olein prices were easier in late trading on Monday on limited buying interest ahead of the holiday season , traders said . 
they said olein was quoted at 1,440-45 rupiah / kg in Jakarta , down from 1,445-50 rupiah at the opening . 
offers were also heard at 1,430-35 rupiah . 
crude palm oil was on offer at around 1,215 rupiah / kg in the North Sumatran city of Medan . 
&quot; The market has been very quiet today , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Players are not taking positions ahead of the holidays . 
although there has been some consumer demand , the overall market is generally quiet . 
traders said the market ignored a statement by head of the state logistics agency BULOG that the government might import more olein if local prices could not be controlled . 
Beddu Amang said last Friday that the government had taken delivery of 38,000 tonnes of the 52,000 tonnes of Malaysian olein it planned to import till January . 
Indonesia would import more olein from Malaysia if local prices could not be controlled , he said . 
&quot; His remarks had no impact because BULOG &apos;s imports are known to the market , &quot; one trader said .
