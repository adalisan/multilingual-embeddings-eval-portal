the Dow industrials gained 68 points , or one percent , to close unofficially at 6833 , its fourth record of the week and eighth in the last 10 trading sessions .

&quot; A lot of the key economic numbers are behind us which leaves earnings in control of the market , &quot; Acuff said . 
&quot; And earnings have been so far , so good . 
with earnings season just a few sessions old , the profit reports have proven favorable and in the meantime the bond market has found stable footing , leaving little in the way of a stock market that continues to draw on a seasonal cash infusion and seems intent on climbing . 
&quot; 7,000 is a foregone short-term conclusion given the behavior of this market , &quot; said Scott Bleier , chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd .

other such stocks included cascade Communications Corp , up 8-1 / 8 to 60 , and Cisco Systems Inc , the industry leader , up 2-1 / 4 to 72-5 / 8 .

record highs were also set on the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 index and the New York Stock Exchange composite . 
the day brought the Dow &apos;s gains for the week to 130 points , or a whisker under two percent .
