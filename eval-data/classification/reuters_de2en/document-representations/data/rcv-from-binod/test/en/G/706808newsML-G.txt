Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert said on Friday he could hold his own with Ronaldo in Italy &apos;s serie A and predicted a great partnership at AC Milan between himself and George Weah . 
Kluivert , who signed for Milan in February before playing out the remaining months of his contract with Ajax , will link up with Liberian striker Weah in a Milan side attempting to bounce back from a disastrous 1996-97 season . 
Ronaldo is hoping to join city rivals Internazionale from Barcelona . 
the two sides are currently locked in a dispute over contract and transfer regulations . 
Kluivert , who scored the winning goal for Ajax against Milan in the 1995 European Cup final , said he wanted to emulate the the great Dutch players of the Italian side &apos;s recent past - forwards Ruud Gullit and Marco Van Basten . 
&quot; I &apos;m here to emulate Van Basten , it &apos;s my dream to do as well as he did here , &quot; he said . 
&quot; As for Gullit , I know he was a god for the Milan fans . 
Kluivert declined to comment on a report in a Dutch newspaper earlier on Friday that he would not be prosecuted over an accusation of rape brought against him last month . 
the report , in the Dutch daily De Telegraaf , said the case had been dropped by a court in Amsterdam because of lack of evidence . 
de Telegraaf said Amsterdam public prosecutors would announce their decision officially later on Friday . 
Kluivert said he did not know if he would ever play again in Amsterdam , where he has been under intense media pressure since his conviction last year for causing death by dangerous driving . 
Kluivert arrives at Milan with his former Ajax team mate and fellow Dutch international Winston Bogarde , who was also introduced to reporters at the Milan news conference . 
Bogarde , a powerful utility player who will probably play in the Milan defence , said he was sure he would adapt to serie A soccer . 
&quot; Being a defender at Ajax is more difficult than at other clubs because they play such attacking football , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In Italy the football is more evenly balanced between defence and attack .
