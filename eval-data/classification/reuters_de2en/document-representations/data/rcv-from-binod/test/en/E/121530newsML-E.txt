San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Parry said the U.S. economy was slowing to a moderate pace . 
&quot; currently , we &apos;re in a pretty good position -- long recovery , robust growth , well-behaved inflation , economy now slowing to a moderate , and I hope sustainable , pace with no clear signs of an end to the recovery , &quot; Parry told students at San Francisco State University . 
in response to a question from the audience about the importance of dollar movements , Parry said : &quot; The value of the dollar is certainly something that the Fed pays attention to because it affects how much we import and how much we export . 
but he added : &quot; What happens to the value of the dollar is not one of the primary objectives to the Federal Reserve . 
Parry said consensus has been an important characteristic of the current Federal Reserve . 
&quot; sure , we can all disagree on individual points , &quot; Parry said . 
&quot; But I think when it comes to the objectives of the Federal Reserve , and very often the way we get there , the amount of consensus I think is the defining characteristic . 
Parry said the Fed &apos;s relationship with the Clinton administration was &quot; good . 
&quot; I feel that the relationship that the Fed has had with the current administration has been really quite good , &quot; Parry said . 
&quot; There &apos;s been a lot of good dialogue , a lot of open communication . 
Parry said the relationship between the Fed and other administrations had varied . 
&quot; I can remember personally that the relationship between the administration and the Fed was not nearly as good , I think , under the Bush administration because the Bush administration let us know in very clear terms what they wanted us to do .
