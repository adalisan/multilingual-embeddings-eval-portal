captain Mark Taylor was an early casualty as Australia , needing 270 for victory , reached tea on 28 for one on the third day of the second test against South Africa on Sunday . 
Taylor again looked hopelessly out of form and scratched around for 13 before being trapped lbw by Brian McMillan . 
that failure meant he has now gone 18 test innings without a half century . 
Matthew Hayden struck one fierce boundary of Allan Donald through midwicket and was 14 not out at tea . 
earlier , South Africa , resuming at 83 for no wicket , collapsed to 168 all out . 
they quickly lost Gary Kirsten , who had added just two to his overnight 41 , when he missed a straight delivery from Jason Gillespie that kept low . 
Jacques Kallis then perished for two to an inspirational piece of fielding from Greg Blewett at square leg . 
a swooping pick-up and direct hit left Kallis stranded by a metre after attempting a quick single . 
opener Adam Bacher was the next to go , top-edging a hook off Gillespie straight to Glenn McGrath on the fine leg boundary . 
Bacher &apos;s 49 contained seven boundaries from 129 deliveries . 
in Gillespie &apos;s next over , his seventh of the morning , he trapped Daryll Cullinan lbw for two with a rapid off-cutter . 
when Herschelle Gibbs was caught at second slip by Mark Waugh off McGrath for seven , South Africa had collapsed from 87 without loss to 122 for five and Australia were right back in the contest . 
McMillan missed a pull shot against a Michael Bevan long hop and fell lbw for two in the last over before lunch which was taken at 137 for six . 
when Bevan removed Hansie Cronje for 27 straight after the interval the tail folded quickly . 
Shane Warne got rid of Shaun pollock and Paul Adams while left-arm spinner Bevan picked up the wicket of Donald to finish with three for 18 .
