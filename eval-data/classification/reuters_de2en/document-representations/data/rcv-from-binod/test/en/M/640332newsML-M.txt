U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sales near midday Thursday were slow at $ 63.00 per cwt , down $ 1.00 from this week &apos;s active sales , but too light for an adequate market test , feedlot sources said . 
about 500 slaughter steers and heifers that will likely grade select and choice sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area , bringing weekly movement there near 129,500 head , cattle feeders there said . 
in Kansas , about 100 steers sold and will likely grade select and choice . 
sales volume bulged amid active trading beginning last Friday , with some of the sales involving animals not sold during the previous week , sources said . 
&quot; This week &apos;s volume was skewed by the fact people waited so long to sell their cattle last week , &quot; a Kansas feedlot operator said . 
another round of lively sales on Tuesday pushed weekly volume to a record in Kansas and a hefty number in the Panhandle area . 
prices skipped on lower beef prices and outlooks for expanded cattle supplies this summer following large spring and late winter placements , sources said .
