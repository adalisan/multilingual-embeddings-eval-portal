a dramatic fall in soycomplex futures in Chicago on Friday has left Europe &apos;s feeds trade wary of committing to fresh physical purchases , and consumers have most nearby needs covered , market sources said on Monday . 
a technical sell off by the funds drove soy prices lower in Chicago but overnight values rebounded , leaving the European market expecting a firmer start to trading this afternoon . 
&quot; This was a technical situation , the funds were very long , &quot; said Arie van Dijk , analyst at market statisticians Stigevo . 
and the move meant although European sellers were offering products at lower levels this morning , there were few takers . 
&quot; Nobody knows what will happen next . 
there is no logic in the market anymore and one has to speculate on what speculators might or might not do , &quot; one trader commented . 
and there seemed little hurry for most of the continent &apos;s physical consumers , who have been limited to buying small quantities of nearby cover in the past few weeks . 
&quot; European consumers have covered for April but there is room for extra cover in May . 
I think they will wait , &quot; Van Dijk said , adding that he thought the market had already peaked . 
&quot; We have seen the top and prices will come lower later this month , &quot; he said , adding that USDA export figures due this afternoon could easily spark a short-term corrective rally . 
traders were equally sceptical over market direction and said the heavy fund involvement in Chicago made the situation very volatile . 
&quot; It &apos;s a weird market at the moment and no-one wants to stick their neck out , &quot; one said . 
&quot; It &apos;s more like a casino than a market , &quot; added another . 
fears of drought in Europe were gaining ground and traders said this was expected to drive grain prices higher , possibly to the benefit of some of the cheaper alternative products such as citruspulp and corglutenfeed . 
van Dijk said the percentage of cornglutenfeed in cattlefeed mixes was expected to rise over the summer months and he noted that consumers still needed cover in the period to June . 
&quot; The market for conglutenfeed will be tight and this will push prices higher , but maybe not this week , &quot; he said .
