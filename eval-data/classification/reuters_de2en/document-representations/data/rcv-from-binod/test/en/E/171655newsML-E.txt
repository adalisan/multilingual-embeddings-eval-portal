Canada recorded a C $ 1.33 budget surplus in September , compared with a C $ 992 million deficit a year earlier , the Finance Department said on Thursday . 
the department said the year-over-year improvement for the month was mostly due to a C $ 1.5 billion , or 13 percent , increase in revenues . 
over half of the September surplus was due to the timing of Goods and Services Tax collections , the department said . 
over the first six months of the fiscal year ending March 31 , the deficit shrank to C $ 7.0 billion from C $ 14.68 billion for the same period a year earlier .
