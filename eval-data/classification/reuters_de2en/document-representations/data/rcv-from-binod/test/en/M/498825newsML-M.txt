COMEX copper clawed itself back into the black by close after trading lower for most of the lackluster session . 
traders blamed the absence of significant fund interest and fresh fundamental news for the lack of direction in the market . 
the funds sold heavily on Monday . 
&quot; People are still suffering from the Fed rate hike and the opinion there will be one or two more , &quot; Richard Hirsch of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said . 
&quot; But they are missing the central point - the Fed hike is not aimed at metal consumption sectors , it &apos;s aimed at the stock market and the wage unit costs hike . 
he expected the market to remain choppy until enough of a consensus emerges to push it in one direction , probably slightly higher . 
may COMEX settled 0.10 cent firmer at 107.75 cents per pound , traded 107.90 to 106.70 cents . 
spot April went out 0.10 cent weaker at 108.90 cents . 
volume was estimated at 6,800 lots . 
traders said the May contract needed to trade at 109.50 cents and above , the previous trading level since February , to inject a more convincing tone into the market . 
tags shrugged off Thursday &apos;s LME stock report which showed a further decline on Wednesday when stocks fell 1,775 tonnes to 160,000 tonnes . 
so far this week stocks on the London exchange have fallen some 14,000 tonnes as traders get used to daily reporting introduced Monday , taking away some of the drama . 
on Thursday Phelps dodge reiterated that its pay freeze deal offered to Chino copper mine workers last August was its final offer . 
workers from Chino protested outside the company &apos;s Phoenix head office on Wednesday against the deal and healthcare benefit changes . 
both sides meet on April 24-25 for talks . 
meanwhile prudential Securities said it now thinks the much-heralded surplus in the copper market will not arrive until 1998 . 
the brokerage estimated that mine and smelter outages this year , plus a few deferrals on new projects , now total nearly 565,000 short tons on an annualised basis , up from an earlier estimate at 375,000 tons . 
&quot; Combined with a 4.2 percent level of world consumption , supply and demand are roughly in balance , inventories are low and London Metal Exchange prices averaged $ 1.09 per pound in ( the first quarter of 1997 ) , or $ 0.04 per pound above our estimate . 
we maintain that this is temporary in nature with the surplus position now being pushed in 1998 , &quot; prudential said .
