Romanian President Emil Constantinescu urged the socialist rulers of neighbouring Yugoslavia on Tuesday to recognise opposition election victories and defuse a growing crisis . 
a statement from the president &apos;s office called on Yugoslav authorities to abide by the recommendations of a commission from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to validate the outcome of November &apos;s disputed polls . 
&quot; The president of Romania believes that prolonging the crisis in Yugoslavia will affect the democratic process there , the country &apos;s return to the international community and have a a negative effect on regional stability , &quot; it said . 
Serbia &apos;s autocratic President Slobodan Milosevic has come under mounting pressure from his opponents after he annulled opposition victories in local polls . 
after weeks of street protests his government acknowledged the opposition did win in some municipalities , but protests have continued unabated . 
&quot; The validation of election results will reduce domestic tensions , lead to democratic development and restore public trust , &quot; the Romanian statement said . 
Constantinescu issued his appeal after a demonstration by the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition on Orthodox Christmas brought hundreds of thousands into Belgrade streets . 
Constantinescu was a leading opposition figure before his election victory over former Communist Ion Iliescu last November and spoke to huge crowds in Bucharest during 1990 protests against rule by ex-communists . 
his statement said the Romanian experience &quot; has proven that half measures in tackling a situation can only lead to higher political and social costs &quot; . 
thousands of protesters gathered for weeks on end in central Bucharest in the spring of 1990 . 
they were dispersed by trainloads of miners who beat up government opponents and smashed public buildings .
