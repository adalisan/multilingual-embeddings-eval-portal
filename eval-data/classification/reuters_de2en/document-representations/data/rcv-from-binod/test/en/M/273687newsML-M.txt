abundant European heating oil supply and slack demand stalled NWE cargo trade on Monday and kept attention on potential arbs of mainly Russian material to Asia and the United States , traders said . 
&quot; The big move for Russian is outside Europe , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; If Russians don &apos;t arb out they normally go into Ara ( the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp barge market ) but there is already plenty of material in Ara , &quot; he said . 
about 180,000 tonnes of Russian is due in the United States this week under NWE arbitrage and two Russians of 90,000 and 120,000 tonnes each are rumoured to be heading to Asia . 
German inland demand remains stagnant despite colder weather in Germany and elsewhere in northern Europe . 
refinery grade heating oil barges were slightly firmer around Jan IPE + 0.50 / 1.00 , largely on the drop in screen values . 
but storage languished at a discount of around - $ 0.50 / 1.00 . 
heating oil cargoes are steady at Jan IPE + $ 4 / 5 for prompt delivery .
