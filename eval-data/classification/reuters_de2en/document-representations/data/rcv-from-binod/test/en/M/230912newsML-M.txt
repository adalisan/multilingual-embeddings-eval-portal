Mexico &apos;s overnight Cetes rate closed down 40 basis points at 27.40 percent on Tuesday on expectations that primary rates were about to fall , dealers said . 
&quot; Paper was in heavy demand all day , especially 28-day and 91-day issues . 
foreign buyers stepped in to latch on to good rates before the primary auction , &quot; said a trader . 
a Reuters survey of 10 dealers predicted an assignment rate of 27.66 percent for bellwether 28-day Cetes rates , or 142 basis points below last week &apos;s auction . 
Banco de Mexico was due to release results of this week &apos;s primary auction of Mexican government securities at 1830 local time / 1930 est Wednesday . 
bids were placed at 26.80 percent for secondary 28-day Cetes , but traders said no deals were made as holders did not wish to sell . 
analysts noted that volume was slightly up during the session and that two big players tried to slow the fall in secondary rates before the close . 
&quot; Some held on to their money until the close to try to stop rates falling too far , but the downward trend was well entrenched , &quot; said one analyst . 
Banco de Mexico injected 6.471 billion pesos into the market to offset liquidity shortfalls by auctioning four credits , which it assigned at between 28.36 and 28.50 percent . 
a liquidity shortfall of some 7.5 billion pesos was estimated for Wednesday .
