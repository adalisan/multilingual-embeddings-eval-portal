fears over the possibility of a winter supply crunch kept oil prices buoyant on Thursday despite an easing of tensions in the Middle East . 
London October futures for bellwether North Sea Brent blend closed up five cents at $ 22.17 a barrel , near its session high of $ 22.22 a barrel achieved on short-covering just before the close . 
Brent shot up more than a dollar after Iraq &apos;s weekend military incursion into Kurdish safe havens and the consequent delay to Iraqi oil exports under a United Nations oil-for-food exchange . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday that retaliatory missile strikes against Iraq after its military incursion into Kurdish safe havens were over for the time being . 
&quot; ( The Iraqi oil sale delay ) will certainly have a physical impact and on top of that there is this speculative factor , &quot; he said Cyrus Tahmassebi , president of Energy Trends Inc in Washington . 
&quot; There is a fear in the market that things could get out of control . 
dealers said jumpy markets remained vulnerable to news of further military action in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq . 
prices twice spiked on Thursday on reports from Kurdish rebels that Iraqi forces were making fresh assaults in the region . 
patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) leader Jalal Talabani , evicted by Iraq from Kurdish capital Arbil , said on Thursday that his forces were still under attack and that he was prepared to seek Iranian help to fight back . 
Iraq &apos;s latest confrontation with the United States has forced an indefinite delay in the implementation of a U.N. agreement allowing Iraq to sell $ 2 billion worth of oil to pay for food and medical supplies . 
without the extra Iraqi crude to help replenish low inventories , analysts expect to see crude prices stay buoyant , at higher levels than previously projected , for months to come . 
Keith Hamm , chairman of London-based consultancy Petroleum Economics Ltd said he expects Brent to hold in a $ 19- $ 21 range during the fourth quarter this year . 
he had previously estimated prices to fall through the bottom of that range later this year with revived Iraqi sales . 
&quot; just-in-time inventory management , Iraqi uncertainty and the winter weather conditions uncertainty could lead to greater price volatility , &quot; said Tahmessebi .
