work has begun on a six billion Belgian franc , multi-berth dock at Antwerp &apos;s port with a capacity to handle up to nine million tons of cargo a year , Antwerp Port Authority said in a statement . 
the Verrebroek Dock project will be developed in three phases and completed by 2001 . 
it will create five kilometres of deepwater quays for non-containerised cargo in the port &apos;s left bank area . 
the new dock &apos;s entrance will be 470 metres wide . 
the Authority said Antwerp was Europe &apos;s biggest port for conventional general cargo , known as breakbulk , which does not include containerised and roll-on / roll-off cargo . 
Antwerp handled 22.1 million tons of breakbulk cargo last year , twice as much as its closest competitor , Rotterdam .
