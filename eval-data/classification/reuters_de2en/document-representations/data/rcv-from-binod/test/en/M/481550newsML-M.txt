Thai rubber prices continued to fall this week in line with a regional market trend as activity in the market was limited , trade sources said on Wednesday . 
there was market talk that the Thai government would soon send a team to Japan to boost sales of rubber to that country after the government said it planned to push China to buy 400,000 tonnes of rubber from Thailand this year . 
&quot; The market is still hanging over from the unwinding of US rubber stocks . 
the lower Tokyo prices also weighed the market down , &quot; said one Bangkok-based trader . 
&quot; There was modest buying in the market . 
China bought some . 
but the government which tried to shore up domestic prices by buying up to 26,400 tonnes since March 5 , had not entered the market this week , trade sources said . 
the Thai benchmark RSS3 rubber for May delivery slid further to 118.00-119.00 US cents a kg fob Bangkok compared with 121.00-122.00 cents on Friday . 
concentrated latex was indicated at around 90 cents .
