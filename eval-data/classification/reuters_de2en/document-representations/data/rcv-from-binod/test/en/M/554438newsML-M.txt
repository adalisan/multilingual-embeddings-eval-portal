Israeli bonds closed higher across the board on Thursday in positive trading amid good demand and price rises , traders said . 
indices : 
* Government bonds general : + 0.09 PCT to 105.89 
* CPI-linked government bonds : + 0.09 at 105.97 
* Unlinked government bonds : + 0.09 PCT to 105.70 
* Dollar-linked government bonds : + 0.11 to 105.57 
* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills : + 0.05 to 104.75 
volume was 194 million shekels . 
&quot; Prices rose across the board but volume in CPI-linked bonds was low because there is no supply of these bonds . 
people are not selling them . 
their yields are around 4.2 percent before taxes , &quot; said Morris Sabag of Sahar Securities . 
&quot; There are two trends in the market , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Those who believe future consumer price indices ( CPI ) will be low , because of a slowdown in the economy , and those who still fear that inflation is raising its head . 
&quot; The market is adjusting itself for a high April consumer price index ( CPI ) , &quot; said Izik Arieli , a trader at United Mizrahi Bank . 
&quot; So everyone is buying CPI-linked bonds . 
&quot; Demand for unlinked bonds was also up because some traders believe that in the long run interest rates will go down as a result of a cut in the government budget , &quot; he said . 
note : Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year . 
the Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity .
