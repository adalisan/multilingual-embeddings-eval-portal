the front lines north of the Afghan capital Kabul were quiet on Friday after four days of heavy fighting which brought opposition forces within 12 miles ( 20 km ) of the Taleban-held city . 
Taleban fighters reported sporadic shelling in the morning , but by midday most of the Taleban soldiers were trying to stay out of the baking heat . 
&quot; There was some heavy shelling this morning for about an hour , but since then it has been quiet . 
&quot; said one Taleban fighter manning an artillery position . 
opposition forces were within rocketing range of Kabul for the first time in nine months , with the front lines in the same place they were shortly after the Taleban took Kabul last September . 
the opposition forces are led by Ahmed Shah Masood , a veteran of the 10-year battle against the Soviet army in the 1980s and the military power behind the ousted administration of President Burhanuddin Rabbani . 
fighters manning a Taleban checkpoint on the outskirts of Kabul denied journalists access to the Taleban western front line on Friday , explaining their safety could not be guaranteed among nervous militia forces . 
travellers from an area close to the front line said there had been no movement by either side during the night . 
&quot; The front line is still around the area of Pol-e-Sufian ( 12 miles ( 20 km ) northwest of Kabul ) . 
it hasn &apos;t changed this morning , &quot; one traveller said . 
in the last four days Masood &apos;s forces have moved 37 miles ( 60 km ) closer to Kabul , capturing the provincial capital of Parwan province , Charikar , and the strategically important Bagram airbase . 
early last October , opposition forces made similar gains . 
then , the purist Islamic Taleban movement &apos;s militia moved rapidly north after capturing Kabul , only to be pushed back in an opposition counter-offensive . 
but the opposition forces were unable to hold their gains and were forced to retreat into the foothills of the Hindu Bush , from where they struck back earlier this week . 
Masood &apos;s advance , combined with the increasing frequency of air raids on Kabul , convinced many foreign aid workers to leave Kabul as a precautionary measure . 
about 50 foreign aid workers streamed out of the city by road for the eastern town of Jalalabad on Friday , following 20 others who left on Wednesday . 
the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Thursday on the warring parties to stop air raids and shelling on civilian areas . 
earlier in the day an air raid on Kabul killed three people and wounded two .
