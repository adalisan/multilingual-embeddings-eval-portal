agreement by industrial countries to assist impoverished debtors should benefit one of two nations by the end of the year , chairman of the International Monetary Fund Interim Committee , Philippe Maystadt , said on Sunday . 
&quot; I really hope that before the end of this year action will be taken on one or two countries ... in the framework of this new initiative , &quot; he told reporters following the meeting of the policy making committee . 
the committee pledged to resolve the issue of how to help the world &apos;s impoverished countries out of their debt trap . 
but IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said that while all the committee agreed to consider ways to make the best use of IMF funds it would be too soon to start selling some of its gold holdings . 
the sale of up to five million ounces of gold has been proposed to help finance the debt initiative but has been opposed by , among others , Germany . 
&quot; We consider that today this decision ( to sell gold ) would be premature , &quot; he said . 
Camdessus said that though the majority of the board supported gold sales , it wanted to resolve the problem through consensus rather than by outvoting opponents . 
&quot; We are confident that the decision will be made in the spirit of compromise , &quot; he added . 
Camdessus said he believed that a special allocation of the Fund &apos;s own currency would be around 26 billion Special Drawing Rights , as the IMF had recommended . 
&quot; It might be a little bit less , a little bit more , &quot; the IMF chief said .
