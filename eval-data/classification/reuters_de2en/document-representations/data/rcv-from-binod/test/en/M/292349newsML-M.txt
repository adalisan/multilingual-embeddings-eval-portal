the won closed slightly weaker against the dollar on Tuesday after trading in a narrow range , traders said . 
the won closed at 844.60 , after opening at an intraday high of 844.30 . 
it hit the bottom of 844.80 . 
traders said a consolidation of dollar against the yen in the international market and worries of a possible central bank dollar selling intervention halted the won from falling too far . 
some banks holding long dollar positions have also lost appetite for the U.S. unit and started unloading , they said . 
&quot; But huge import deals scheduled for early next week will pressure the won for the rest of this week , &quot; said one trader . 
the base mid-rate is seen at 844.60 for Wednesday , compared with 844.70 on Tuesday .
