a Labour government in London would not allow the IRA &apos;s political wing , Sinn Fein , into talks unless the guerrillas first abandoned violence , its chief Northern Ireland spokeswoman , Mo Mowlam , said on Sunday . 
Mowlam told the London-based Sunday Times newspaper that she will be given the key role of chief British minister in the troubled province if Labour wins a national election on May 1 . 
as Northern Ireland Secretary she would tackle a range of sensitive issues to try to stabilise the province &apos;s volatile political climate but said she would not change conditions laid down by the ruling Conservatives for Sinn Fein &apos;s entry to talks . 
&quot; It is up to Sinn Fein and the IRA , they know what they have to do to get into talks , &quot; she said . 
Sinn Fein leaders say that if they win Northern Ireland seats in parliament in the election they should be entitled to admission to multi-party talks that restart on June 3 , from which they have been excluded because the guerrillas spurn demands they renew their truce . 
&quot; There is no way that June 3 is a possibility ( for Sinn Fein admission ) for the simple reasons that we have to have words and deeds to show their commitment to a ceasefire , &quot; Mowlam said . 
an agreed stance by Britain &apos;s Conservatives and Labour against talks places for Sinn Fein before an end to IRA violence is shared by the Irish government . 
Dublin is a joint sponsor of discussions , involving all of Northern Ireland &apos;s political groups except Sinn Fein , which were adjourned amid deadlock in March by their chairman , former U.S. senator George Mitchell , to allow parties to prepare for the May poll . 
the IRA on Sunday admitted it caused a bomb blast near a British motorway last Friday , the latest in a series of actions that have snarled road and rail traffic in parts of the British mainland in the run-up to the election . 
&quot; Throughout this election campaign they have undermined the confidence needed every time we have had a problem this side of the water , so they have made it more difficult for themselves to convince us that any new ceasefire would be genuine , &quot; Mowlam said .
