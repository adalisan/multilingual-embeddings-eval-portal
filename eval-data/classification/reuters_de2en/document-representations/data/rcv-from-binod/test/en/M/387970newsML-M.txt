SIMEX Euroyen futures edged higher on the back of gains in Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures in an otherwise featureless market on Wednesday . 
dealers said the market ignored gains in Tokyo stocks and comments by Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita about Japan &apos;s economic recovery becoming more solid . 
December was at 99.27 against 99.24 . 
March JGBs settled at 126.70 against their previous 126.13 . 
dealers said the contract was suddenly pushed up from its earlier high of 126.42 before the close by local players trying to trigger stop-loss buy orders . 
&quot; It &apos;s crazy . 
there were only two locals in the pit . 
and from 126.50 to 126.70 , only three lots were traded , &quot; said a dealer with a European house . 
&quot; They were trying to create new highs so that those with stops would come in , &quot; he said . 
he said the move was a freak trade and Tokyo was likely to follow the contract price set by LIFFE at Thursday &apos;s open . 
&quot; JGBs have consolidated around 126.00 for the last couple of days . 
they were very well bid out of Tokyo between 125.90 and 126.00 , &quot; said a trader with an Asian futures house . 
&quot; Any pullback would be a good opportunity to go long , &quot; he said , adding that there was no sign of any rollover activity into the June contract as yet . 
&quot; The PPI number put some pressure on people who had shorted the market . 
they were expecting a positive number and it turned out negative so a lot of people were caught on the wrong side , &quot; said the trader . 
economists on average expect the overall CPI to be up 0.3 percent and the core level , excluding the volatile food and energy components , to increase 0.2 percent .
