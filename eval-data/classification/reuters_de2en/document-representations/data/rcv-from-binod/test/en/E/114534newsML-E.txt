three key developing countries on Monday challenged the World Trade Organisation Secretariat over a report to be released this week which argues that the controversial issue of rules on foreign investment should be taken up by the WTO . 
the challenge over investment -- raised by India and backed by Malaysia and Tanzania -- came at a meeting of the WTO General Council called to discuss the agenda for the ministers in Singapore and the text of the declaration . 
several developing countries in Asia and Africa believe they that they were being pressured into agreeing to work for enforceable , global WTO rules on how they treat foreign investment . 
the European Union , Japan and Canada -- three of the four top world trade powers -- are pushing hard for the issue to be included in the Singapore ministerial declaration , which would set out a work programme for the WTO for the next two years . 
some other emerging economies , especially in Latin America but also including some Asians , are ready to agree to start up discussions -- hoping they will gain some concessions from the big powers in other WTO areas . 
but an UNCTAD seminar on the issue last week revealed the strength of feeling , even among some of the more neutral states , against moving into an area which could put limits on their policies to promote national industries . 
at the same time , the WTO &apos;s two top officials told delegations representing the 124 member countries they had set November 7 as a firm deadline for completion of a declaration to be issued at its first ministerial meeting in December . 
the WTO report , from analysts in the Secretariat , normally careful to avoid taking sides in disputed issues , is to be made public on Wednesday , but Director-General Renato Ruggiero has already revealed the import of its message . 
it will , he told the ruling body of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) last week , make a &quot; compelling case &quot; for taking up the question of negotiatiing investment rules in the WTO . 
referring to advance indications of the report &apos;s contents , India &apos;s WTO ambassador Srinavasan Narayanan told the General Council he felt the Secretariat was &quot; trying to push one particular point of view on this subject . 
he added : &quot; The respect and the credibility which the WTO Secretariat commands with delegations like mine is directly relatable to the fact that the Secretariat does not try to take sides when delegations have different approaches to issues . 
trade diplomats who earlier felt the strongest opponents -- like India -- were taking a strong line to underpin a demand for more openings in richer countries for Asian textile products -- are now having second thoughts . 
&quot; I think there is something very serious in this , &quot; said one envoy . 
&quot; It is not just a bargaining posture . 
other controversial issues major powers have been seeking to put on the Singapore agenda against fierce opposition from developing countries include labour standards , corruption and competition policy .
