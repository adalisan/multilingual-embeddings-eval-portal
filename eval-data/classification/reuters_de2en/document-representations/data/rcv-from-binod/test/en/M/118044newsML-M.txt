the Istanbul Gold Exchange is to launch futures trading by the end of this year to increase traded volume and participation from members , its secretary-general Kaan Aytogu said on Tuesday . 
&quot; It is expected that gold futures trading will begin at the ( Istanbul Gold Exchange ) towards the end of this year , &quot; Aytogu said during a speech at the International Gold Markets conference in Istanbul . 
he said the market would respond promptly to futures trading because &quot; it offers attractive hedging opportunities for the jewellery sector , opportunities for international fund managers for arbitrage and spreading facilities . 
he said an infrastructure including a screen-based service was completed for both physical and futures trading , to be carried out on a lira per gramme and dollars per ounce basis . 
the exchange was also planning to begin silver trading on both the physical and futures markets after resolving some issues regarding taxation . 
traders said transactions on the physical market , launched in July 1995 , had been thinner since September due to seasonal factors . 
Aytogu said a &quot; lack of standard and related unfair practices &quot; in the jewellery sector showed the need to set up a gold refinery , where standardised final and raw gold would be produced . 
Turkey plans to build a joint-stock refinery to process 100 tonnes annually . 
the plant might begin operation later in 1997 when an approval process by the London Bullion Market Association begins . 
Aytogu said gold deposit accounts , operated by a limited number of banks in Turkey , would also help the country turn into a gold exporter . 
they would also help unearth a considerable amount of the approximately 6,000 tonnes of gold hoarded as ornaments and savings . 
Turkey imported 25.1 tonnes of gold in the first quarter of this year , down from 31.7 tonnes in fourth quarter 1995 and compared to 11 tonnes in first quarter 1995 . 
its total 1995 imports amounted to 122.5 tonnes , up from 38.1 tonnes in 1994 .
