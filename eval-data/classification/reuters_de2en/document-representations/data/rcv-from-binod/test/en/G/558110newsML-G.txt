Interior Minister Yogie Memet has said the cancellation of some election campaigning by Indonesia &apos;s two minor parties was not unusual , the official Antara news agency reported on Saturday . 
Memet , who also heads the national General Election Institute ( LPU ) responsible for running the poll , said disturbances that marred the first week of the 27-day campaign last week should not be exaggerated . 
&quot; boycotts or other disturbances are common and do not need to be exaggerated , &quot; Memet told reporters on Friday . 
on Friday , the minority United Development Party ( PPP ) cancelled five election rallies in Jakarta after it said police had refused permission for a meeting to be addressed by the party &apos;s leader . 
Jakarta police said they did not ban the PPP campaign but the permit they had sought did not match a previous agreement between the party and security agencies . 
&quot; They have unilaterally cancelled a consensus on campaigning without prior consultation with the other parties and the Election Supervision Committee , &quot; city police chief Major-General Hamami Nata was quoted by the Jakarta Post on Saturday as saying . 
despite the cancellation , thousands of PPP supporters took to the streets of the capital on Friday in illegal convoys of motorcyles and other vehicles in open violation of strict campaign regulations . 
police did not confront the rallies . 
Jakarta was quiet on Saturday , a Golkar campaigning day . 
the Moslem-oriented PPP , one of only three parties allowed to contest May 29 general elections , also halted campaigning in the central Java city of Yogyakarta after windows at its party headquarters there were smashed this week . 
clashes between supporters of rival parties have also been reported in other districts in Central Java province , especially around the northern coastal town of Pekalongan . 
in Indonesia &apos;s second city of Surabaya the other minority party , the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) , stopped campaigning after it had to cancel a rally following a clash between supporters of two rival factions . 
the three legal parties , the PPP , the ruling Golkar and the PDI , have agreed to campaign on different days in different parts of the country to avoid violence . 
they are vying for the backing of nearly 125 million voters to fill 425 elected seats in the 500-seat House of Representatives . 
the other seats are allotted to the military , which does not vote . 
Golkar , in power for the past 30 years under President Suharto &apos;s rule , is seeking to push its share of the vote over 70 percent from the 68 percent it won in the last polls in 1992 . 
the Jakarta Post said on Saturday that small clashes between Golkar and PPP supporters continued around Pekalongan on Friday . 
Central Java has been the main focus for political violence , primarily between supporters of the PPP and Golkar , in the run-up to the start of the three-week election campaign last Sunday .
