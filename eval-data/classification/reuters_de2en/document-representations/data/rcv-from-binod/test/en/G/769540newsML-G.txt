police in Arkansas &apos;s largest city are concerned with a sudden surge in drive-by shootings that have killed four people in five nights and wounded several others . 
the murders have occurred in a predominantly black neighbourhood in the central city that in recent years has been the scene of turf battles between rival gangs . 
&quot; We have no evidence that a gang war as such is under way , but obviously we &apos;re concerned about the level of violence , &quot; said Lt. John Hutchinson , spokesman for the Little Rock Police Department . 
&quot; You don &apos;t know which way the bullets are flying or who &apos;s firing them or where they &apos;re coming from because they &apos;re always so close , &quot; said a woman in the neighbourhood who spoke on condition of anonymity . 
&quot; It makes you want to fall on the floor when you hear it , &quot; she added . 
virtually all the recent killings resulted from shots fired from passing cars . 
most of the victims as well as those arrested have been in their teens or early 20s . 
the dead included a 16-year-old girl who was watching television when a stray bullet pierced her family &apos;s home and struck her in the head , killing her instantly . 
police quickly arrested an 18-year-old suspect , but when a suspicious crowd gathered outside the Courthouse on the morning of his arraignment they kept the man in a cell for security reasons and his attorney was allowed to enter a plea of not guilty in his behalf . 
Hutchinson said additional police tactical units were assigned to the area to shorten the response time to shootings and to raise the police department &apos;s visibility in the neighbourhood . 
&quot; We &apos;re hoping it will make a difference , &quot; he said . 
in recent years murder in Little Rock , a city of 170,000 , has declined along with the murder rates of other American cities . 
the record in Little Rock was set in 1993 when 63 people were killed . 
fewer than half that number were murdered in Little Rock in 1996 and Hutchinson said even with the most recent deaths , the number of homicides was still smaller than at this time last year .
