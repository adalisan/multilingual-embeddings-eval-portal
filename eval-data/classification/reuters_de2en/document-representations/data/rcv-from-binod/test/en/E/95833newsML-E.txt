next Friday &apos;s producer prices and retail sales reports may get looks , but whistles and jeers are likely to be contained , said economists in a Reuters poll . 
on average , 26 pundits forecast the overall Producer Price Index ( PPI ) rose 0.3 percent in September , the same as its August performance . 
they forecast core PPI , which excludes volatile food and energy prices , rose 0.2 percent in September , up from a decline of 0.1 percent last month . 
but such a modest increase in core PPI will not sound inflation alarms , according to Peter Kretzmer , senior economist at NationsBanc Capital Markets Inc , who forecast core PPI rose 0.2 percent in September . 
&quot; Core inflation remains very much under control . 
I think falling computer prices this month may help to hold down core inflation ... that may be one of the reasons , &quot; Kretzmer added . 
on average , experts forecast September overall retail prices rose 0.2 percent and retail sales , excluding autos , rose 0.3 percent . 
Michael Strauss , executive vice president and chief economist at Yamaichi International ( America ) Inc , said that underestimated auto sales in August may translate into a healthy September figure . 
&quot; Given the inaccuracy of retail sales survey for car dealers in August , meaning they understated numbers , they probably will end up a little stronger , &quot; he said .
