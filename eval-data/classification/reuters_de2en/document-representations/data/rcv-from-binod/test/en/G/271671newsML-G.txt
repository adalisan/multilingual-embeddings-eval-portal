the following is a translation of the complete text of a communique issued late on Friday by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) guerrillas holding about 360 hostages at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima . 
to national and international public opinion : 
the MRTA repeats that the extreme measure of occupying the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence obeys the need to save the lives of our jailed comrades suffering a rigorous jail regime . 
the treatment we are giving the people held is in accordance with the boundaries of respect for human dignity that have always characterised our organisation . 
that to facilitate a political , negotiated solution to these events we proceeded to free unconditionally all the women and other men with deteriorating health due to their advanced age , including family members of ( President Alberto ) Fujimori himself . 
on the government &apos;s side , however , there is still an attitude which , above all , affects the people captured by the MRTA , given that the cutting of telephone , water and light services is in practice a repressive measure against people who rather should be given the necessary support . 
we ratify that the only possible solution is to listen to our requests and proceed with the freedom of all our jailed members . 
we think that a gesture of that nature would help give the first steps to a global solution of the problem of political violence through the path of dialogue and a more permanent peace accord . 
we have proposed this position to the people we have as prisoners , especially to the gentlemen of the diplomatic corps present here and with whom we could specify a timetable to arrive at an integral solution . 
we think that to continue with the attitude taken by the government , some authorities and certain journalists to continue calling us &quot; assassins and terrorists &quot; does nothing to contribute to a solution . 
this position of dialogue proposed by the MRTA is not new . 
throughout our existence , we have always shown a disposition toward dialogue , so the government should not take it as a position of weakness on our part , considering that with a policy of wearing us down it embraces the hope that finally we will surrender . 
on the other hand , we indicated that through the International Red Cross we have requested telephone communication with our jailed comrades so as to find out what their current state of health is . 
we want to specify to international public opinion that the arrest of the gentlemen from the diplomatic corps obeys the need to maintain personnel who can guarantee the necessary levels on the way to seeking a peaceful solution . 
however , we signal that with the same emphasis in which we propose integral solutions , we ratify the firmness of our requests . 
whatever extreme measure that puts at physical risk the jailed people will be the exclusive responsibility of the government and those who join this position of not ceding to &quot; terrorist blackmail , &quot; maintaining this mistaken criterion to deny the structural problems that originated Peru &apos;s political violence .
