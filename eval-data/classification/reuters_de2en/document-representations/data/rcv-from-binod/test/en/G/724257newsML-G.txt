rival factions battling in the Congo Republic capital Brazzaville have signed a ceasefire which should come into effect at midnight on Monday , the United Nations envoy mediating in the crisis said on Saturday . 
&quot; I have been told by both sides that they have signed the document , &quot; U.N envoy Mohamed Sahnoun told Reuters by telephone from Gabon . 
forces supporting President Pascal Lissouba and the militia of former military ruler Denis Sassou Nguesso have battled in Brazzaville for more than a month . 
hundreds of people have died . 
a ceasefire has been held up by Lissouba &apos;s refusal to sign it and Sassou &apos;s insistence that the president , not the prime minister , should endorse it . 
Sahnoun , a veteran Algerian diplomat , was in Brazzaville on Thursday for talks with the chief rivals . 
he later said Lissouba had agreed to put his own signature to the agreemnt . 
Sassou &apos;s spokesman Francois Iboovi confirmed it had been signed . 
&quot; The ceasefire has been signed . 
but in the meantime if we are attacked we will of course respond , &quot; Iboovi said . 
&quot; If the ceasefire holds it is planned that it will be followed by serious negotations . 
similar fighting killed more than 2,000 people in Brazzaville in 1993 after disputed multi-party elections . 
the latest round flared on June 5 after the army surrounded Sassou &apos;s home as part of a crackdown on private militias ahead of scheduled presidential elections on July 27 . 
both Lissouba and Sassou plan to stand in the elections , now certain to be postponed . 
another warlord also running , Brazzaville mayor Bernard Kolelas , has kept his militia out of the current fighting and heads a national mediation committee . 
Gabon &apos;s president Omar Bongo , a son-in-law of Sassou and friend of Lissouba , has been trying to rally the rivals around a July 14 ceasefire . 
residents of Brazzaville , which is across the Congo river from the Democratic Congo capital , Kinshasa , reported sporadic fighting in the city centre on Saturday . 
occasional shellfire could be heard from Kinshasa throughout the day , but there has been no fighting on the scale that devastated whole districts of the capital a few weeks ago . 
former colonial power France sent troops to evacuate its nationals and other foreigners . 
shops and businesses remain closed .
