Northern Ireland police on Sunday found a substantial amount of home-made explosive in a search of a Catholic housing estate in Londonderry , security sources said . 
they said three containers were found at the rear of a house and examined by army bomb disposal experts . 
houses were evacuated during the operation , which began on Sunday afternoon , residents said . 
home-made explosives are a favoured weapon of the Irish Republican Army , which is fighting British rule of Northern Ireland . 
the province has been tense in recent weeks as it neared the height of the traditional marching season by pro-British Protestant &quot; Loyalists &quot; . 
Londonderry , Northern Ireland &apos;s second city , is a stronghold of Catholic Irish nationalists .
