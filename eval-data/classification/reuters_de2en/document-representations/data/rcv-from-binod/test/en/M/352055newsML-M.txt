Winnipeg commodity Exchange canola futures were expected to open lower following projected declines in Chicago Board of Trade soy complex futures , despite tight canola stocks indicated by Statistics Canada , analysts said . 
but the declines in Winnipeg were seen as less severe than the drop expected in CBOT soy . 
&quot; We &apos;ll be firmer , relative to the U.S. You can temper the bullishness of the report on a sharp drop in the U.S. market expected right off the opening , &quot; LFG analyst Rob Diziak said . 
as of December 31 , 1996 , on-farm stocks of canola were down 20.3 percent at 2.758 million tonnes , compared with 3.460 million the previous year , the StatsCan report showed . 
&quot; It looks like the crop was overestimated . 
does the report take into account grain that &apos;s sitting out in the field ? 
probably not , &quot; Dzisiak added . 
four percent of prairie fields , about two million acres , had yet to be combined after a cold , wet harvest last fall , Agriculture Canada has said . 
Flaxseed was seen as neutral to WCE futures , with on-farm stocks down 16.8 percent at 475,000 tonnes compared with 565,000 tonnes Dec 31 , 1995 . 
however , lower U.S. soybean calls were expected to weigh on the WCE flax market , analysts said . 
the oat number &apos;s a little lower , the farmer &apos;s still in major ownership of feed wheat and barley which is negative longer term , &quot; pool commodity Trading Service analyst Keith Ferley said . 
feed wheat and barley were both expected to open C $ 0.50 to C $ 1.00 per tonne lower while oats and feed peas were called steady , the analysts concurred .
