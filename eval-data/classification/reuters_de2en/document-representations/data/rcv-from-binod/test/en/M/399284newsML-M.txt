Hong Kong &apos;s interbank rate and government paper markets held steady in quiet trade on Monday with participants sidelined ahead of U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s testimony to Congress on Wednesday , dealers said . 
&quot; The markets lack direction and people are sidelined ahead of Greenspan &apos;s speech , &quot; a dealer said . 
money rates were steady to slightly higher with overnights traded at 5-1 / 8 1 / 16 percent , up 1 / 8 from Friday and three-month was unchanged at 5-1 / 2 7 / 16 percent . 
dealers said expected month-end and stock money demand might lift short-term rates by 1 / 4 percent later this week . 
a share flotation by the Shenzhen government-backed Shum Yip Investment Ltd will close on Wednesday , they said . 
trading in Exchange Fund bills and notes drifted sideways with prices and yields little changed at midday . 
the one-week bills yielded 4.57 percent and three month yields were 4.76 percent . 
the two-year note yields stood at 5.64 percent and the 10-year note yielded 6.88 percent . 
dealers said the relatively steep yield curve for government paper provided a chance for players to take advantage of mis-matches . 
they also said spreads between local and U.S. treasuries were a bit narrow . 
&quot; I expected spreads at the long-end will be widened slightly later with 10 years move to 50-60 points , &quot; one European bank dealer said . 
the 10-year EFN was yielding more than 40 basis points above the U.S. treasuries .
