foreign investors can put US $ 54 billion more into Taiwan &apos;s stock market before an official ceiling is hit , the central bank said on Friday . 
foreigners now hold about US $ 10.4 billion of equity in Taiwan shares , well below the current cap of 25 percent of total market value , figures released by the bank showed . 
under the 25 percent cap , investors could invest a total of US $ 64.5 billion in Taiwan &apos;s stock market , the bank said . 
foreign institutions poured a net US $ 217 million into the stock market between October 1-8 , compared with US $ 348 million in all of September , the statement said . 
the cap on foreign-held equity was raised to 25 percent from 20 percent in late September . 
Taiwan has pledged to phase out the ceiling altogether in coming years . 
the bank also has set a ceiling of US $ 5.564 billion for funds raised overseas by local firms through convertible bonds and global depositary receipts . 
in this category , foreigners as of October 8 still had room to put a further $ 1.219 billion into the island , the bank said .
