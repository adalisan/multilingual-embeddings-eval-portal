a Texas woman who set out more than two months ago to complete the doomed flight of Amelia Earhart is preparing to take off on the last and most challenging leg of her journey around the world . 
Linda Finch told reporters on Thursday she expects to arrive back at her starting point of Oakland , California on May 28 following a few days of rest in Hawaii and an overnight flight across the Pacific Ocean . 
Finch &apos;s 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E plane , almost identical to Earhart &apos;s , will be strained by the heavy fuel load required for the 2,000-mile ( 3,200 kms ) flight to Oakland . 
with just a two-hour margin on fuel , Finch said she may have to delay the trip or turn back if winds are too strong . 
she plans to take off for the final leg of the trip on May 27 . 
&quot; We &apos;ll be several tons over what the aircraft was designed for , &quot; Finch said . 
&quot; It will be a very critical takeoff and we &apos;ll have to do everything perfectly . 
Finch took off on her &quot; World Flight 1997 &quot; on March 17 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of legendary aviator Amelia Earhart . 
LN 1932 , Earhart became the first woman to fly solo actross the Atlantic , but in 1937 she disappeared in the South Pacific while on an attempted flight around the world . 
no trace of her plane was ever found and the disappearance remains a mystery . 
despite flying in the primitive plane , the 46-year-old Finch , a businesswoman and a grandmother , said her trip has been without major incident so far . 
&quot; It is loud , small and somewhat uncomfortable , but there has really been no problem with it . 
the engines have run perfectly , &quot; she said . 
but she conceded her challenge was mild compared with the endeavours of the pioneering pilots of Earhart &apos;s day . 
one big difference is the modern navigation equipment installed in Finch &apos;s plane . 
no . 
it was just too hard a flight . 
what pilots did in that time was so much more dangerous , risky and adventurous . 
they were absolutely leading the way , &quot; Finch said . 
Finch &apos;s journey has taken her across the United States to Brazil , Africa , Europe , Egypt , India , Thailand and Singapore . 
on May 18 , she flew out of New Guinea , the point where Earhart disappeared 60 years ago . 
&quot; I thought about how she must have been so elated at that point , &quot; said Finch . 
&quot; She was really so close to home . 
and then to have not made it . 
it really struck me .
