Brazilian shares shot higher on strong U.S. volumes Wednesday , propelled by blue chip Telebras &apos;s rate hike plans and a congressional vote to lower export taxes . 
Telebras jumped in early U.S. trade but later pared its gains after the company denied Brazilian newspaper reports that it planned a 200 percent hike in basic telephone subscription rates for November . 
a Telebras spokesman in Brazil confirmed that a rate rise for November was planned but said the size was not known at this time . 
he denied that a 200 percent hike was planned . 
&quot; When that news came out , the market took it like a cold shower , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; The reason the shares rose so much this morning was because of the newspaper reports . 
newspapers said Telebras &apos;s basic service rates would be raised to 11.22 reais by November from 3.74 reais . 
the Telebras spokesman said reporters had misunderstood a presentation by a company official on Tuesday . 
traders said the market expected Telebras rates to rise to a range of six to seven reais . 
Telebras rose over two percent , gaining 1-3 / 4 to 74-7 / 8 by early afternoon after hitting 76-1 / 4 earlier . 
pulp firm Aracruz also rose , boosted by the perception that it might benefit from a reduction in export taxes . 
Brazil &apos;s Lower House approved a bill late Tuesday that would cut taxes on exports . 
Aracruz was up 1 / 4 at 9-1 / 8 . 
elsewhere , Mexican shares tilted higher in thin trade on the back of optimism about the country &apos;s economic recovery and positive second-quarter earnings expectations . 
&quot; They &apos;re all back on their up trajectory . 
Cetes rates were pretty good , there was good demand , and the peso &apos;s stronger , so everything &apos;s positive , &quot; one trader said . 
Televisa rose 1 / 4 to 31-1 / 2 , Tribasa firmed 1 / 8 to 5-1 / 8 , and Telmex held steady at 34-3 / 8 . 
Argentine and Chilean ADRs were mixed on weak volumes , with Banco Frances up 1 / 8 at 23-1 / 2 , Telefonica off 1 / 4 at 23-7 / 8 , CTC up 1 / 2 at 97-1 / 4 , and Madeco off 1 / 8 at 23-5 / 8 . 
in other activity , News Corp gained over two percent , rising 1 / 2 to 21-3 / 8 on growing confidence about its outlook , traders said . 
&quot; Over a period of a week or two , people have got a chance to look through News Corp &apos;s earnings , and they &apos;ve become more confident that the company is on track , &quot; a trader said .
