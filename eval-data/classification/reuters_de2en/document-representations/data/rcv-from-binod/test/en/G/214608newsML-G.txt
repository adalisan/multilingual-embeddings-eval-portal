Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Elio di Rupo , under investigation following under-age sex allegations , came under fire on Monday for his previously hidden homosexuality . 
Charles Ferdinand Nothomb , chairman of the francophone Christian-Democrat PSC government party , was quoted as saying that a minister could not be openly homosexual . 
&quot; I have problems with anyone who is an apologist for homosexuality , &quot; Nothomb was quoted as saying in Belgian media . 
Belgium &apos;s parliament asked the country &apos;s top court last Thursday to investigate allegations that Di Rupo had sex with boys younger than 16 , the country &apos;s age of consent . 
Di Rupo , a discreet homosexual , has denied the allegations , and several newspapers have seriously questioned the reliability of the sole witness who has testified against him . 
the chairman of his francophone Socialist Party PS backed Di Rupo and said he should keep his job while the court investigated . 
but he ducked questions about Nothomb &apos;s statement . 
&quot; The PS reiterates its confidence in its deputy prime minister , &quot; Philippe Busquin told a news conference on Monday . 
on Friday , two Flemish newspapers questioned whether a homosexual could hold a ministerial post . 
&quot; The number two in the government is a 45-year-old man who ... frequents night-time bars , seeks relations with socially weak youngsters and avoids questions about their age . 
even if they are not minors , the question remains whether such a man can represent the country and the king , &quot; daily De Standaard wrote . 
Marc Platel , editorialist of Flemish daily het Belang van Limburg , said on Friday politicians should behave &quot; decently &quot; . 
&quot; By visiting certain circles or bars ... public figures are vulnerable to blackmail , regardless of whether they are homosexual or heterosexual , &quot; Platel said . 
the Belgian parliament on Monday released details of the allegations against Di Rupo . 
&quot; Statements made to the prosecutor could indicate a possible crime by ( di Rupo ) ... If these facts proved to be true , they could be described as rape of a minor , &quot; the report said . 
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene last week accused the prosecutor of not vertfying the authenticity of the allegations before making his report to parliament .
