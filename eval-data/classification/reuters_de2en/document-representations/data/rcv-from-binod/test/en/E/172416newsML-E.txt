the National Bank of Slovakia ( NBS ) on Thursday narrowed its forecast of the 1996 foreign trade deficit to 50 to 52 billion crowns from the previously expected range of 40 to 52 billion forecast in September . 
&quot; We ( NBS ) expect the foreign trade deficit to be within the range of 50 to 52 billion crowns at the end of this year , &quot; Elena Kohutikova , the head of the NBS monetary division , told a news conference . 
Slovakia &apos;s foreign trade gap widened in the first nine months of this year to 37.17 billion crowns in current prices , from 35.078 billion for the January-August period . 
this compares with a trade surplus of 405 million crowns for the first nine months of 1995 . 
the original NBS forecast for the 1996 foreign trade balance , made at the beginning of the year , was for a deficit of around 11 billion crowns , but the central bank in September revised the forecast to 40 to 52 billion . 
in 1995 Slovakia posted a foreign trade surplus of 1.8 billion crowns . 
government officials have said the turnabout was no cause for concern , as imports , totalling 234.47 billion crowns in January-September period , included oil , technology and investment goods needed to restructure the country &apos;s economy . 
NBS governor Vladimir Masar told the same news conference that the development of the trade balance over the past few months was within the central bank expectations . 
but he added that the NBS expected December to be , as it is traditionally , the worst month for the foreing trade balance .
