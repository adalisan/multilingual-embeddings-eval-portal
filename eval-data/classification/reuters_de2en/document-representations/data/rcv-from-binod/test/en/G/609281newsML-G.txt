a military helicopter crashed into a field near a southeast Dallas school on Friday and it appeared there were no survivors , officials said . 
&quot; We think it was some kind of Marine helicopter , &quot; Dallas firefighter Raymond Sweeney told Reuters . 
&quot; We don &apos;t know how many people were on board . 
&quot; There was no indication that anyone on the ground was killed or injured in the crash . 
fire teams raced to the scene and put out the blaze as police sealed off the area less than a mile from the intersection of two major highways in the southeast Dallas suburb of Hutchins . 
the helicopter came down in a field behind Hutchins High School and rescue teams searched the area for possible survivors . 
witnesses said the helicopter narrowly missed slamming into a house as it came down . 
&quot; It was right over the house so whoever was piloting it is a hero in my books because he could have killed us all , &quot; local resident Velva Washburn said .
