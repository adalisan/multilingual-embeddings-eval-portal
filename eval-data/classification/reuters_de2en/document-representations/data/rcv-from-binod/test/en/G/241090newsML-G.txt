a &quot; Euro-sceptic &quot; member of the ruling Conservative party said on Thursday British finance minister Kenneth Clarke had to resign to prevent the party disintegrating over the issue of a single European currency . 
Member of Parliament Tony Marlow said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year . 
&quot; We have a divided and split Cabinet . 
this cannot endure , &quot; Marlow told BBC television &apos;s Newsnight programme on Thursday . 
&quot; It is not sustainable . 
Kenneth Clarke has to go . 
if he doesn &apos;t resign , the prime minister has got to fire him . 
Marlow &apos;s comment come on the heels of speculation that Clarke had threatened to resign if the government changed its &quot; wait and see &quot; policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for the currency in the next Parliament . 
Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John Major . 
major told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership . 
his statement was interpreted as a significant victory for Clarke and fellow pro-European Michael Heseltine , deputy prime minister .
