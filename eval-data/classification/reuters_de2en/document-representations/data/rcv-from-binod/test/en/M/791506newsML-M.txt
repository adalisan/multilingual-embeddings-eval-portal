the dollar recouped some of Friday &apos;s sharp losses against the German mark and Japanese yen on Monday , rising as U.S. financial markets regained their composure after ending last week with a massive selloff . 
propelling a late rally was speculation that the Federal Reserve might refrain from raising interest rates despite a strong U.S. economy . 
&quot; The bond market turned around and that turned around the stock market and the dollar went right up with it , &quot; said Bob Near , a vice president of foreign exchange sales at Bank of New York . 
the Dow Jones industrial average gained almost 31 points in late trading to close at 8,062 after earlier sliding more than 65 points . 
the 30-year Treasury bond also trimmed sharp losses to end with a slight gain . 
the dollar rose to 1.8640 marks from 1.8452 marks on Friday and to 116.18 yen from 114.80 . 
it also rose to 1.5263 Swiss francs from 1.5097 on Friday . 
the rebound started overnight . 
investors in the Far East and Europe found the dollar too cheap to resist , speculating that Friday &apos;s decline was only a temporary retreat from the rally that reached an eight-year high against the mark and a three-month peak against the yen early last week . 
the U.S. currency was bolstered vs. the yen by a huge decline in Japanese shares . 
it was also heartened that European markets regained their footing after stumbling in the wake of Friday &apos;s 157-point fall in the Dow and the trouncing of the Treasury bond . 
&quot; I really think it was just the stabler tone , probably helped a little bit by the more stable tone in European asset markets , and then the U.S. following that , &quot; said Bob Lynch , a currency strategist at Paribas in New York . 
&quot; There hasn &apos;t been any real follow through on selling from Friday ... for the time being it &apos;s clearly contributed to a more stable , less active tone for the dollar , &quot; he added . 
as is often the case during the peak summer holiday period , many dealers preferred the safety of the sidelines , at least until after the German central bank signals its intentions on interest rates at its weekly money market operation on Tuesday . 
before adjourning in late July for its four-week summer recess , the Bundesbank fanned speculation that it might allow its key short term rate to increase to stem the mark &apos;steady decline . 
but a weak German economy may be a restraint . 
&quot; Given their domestic economic situation they don &apos;t want a weak deutschemark but the deutschemark weakening as it has has helped their competitive advantage , so I don &apos;t think they are going to do anything , &quot; said John Nelson , foreign exchange trading manager at ABN-AMRO Bank in Chicago . 
in other trading , the British pound rose to $ 1.5900 from $ 1.5875 and the dollar rose to Canadian $ 1.3934 from C $ 1.3902 .
