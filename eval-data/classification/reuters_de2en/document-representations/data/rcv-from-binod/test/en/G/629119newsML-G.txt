Sierra Leone coup leader Major Johnny Paul Koromah announced the members of his Armed Forces Revolutionary Council on Sunday with himself as chairman and rebel leader Foday Sankoh as vice chairman . 
diplomats negotiating with the coup leader for restoration of the elected government played down the announcement carried on state radio , saying they still expected a deal to be signed . 
Koromah announced a 20-member council , including three more members of Sankoh &apos;s Revolutionary United Front . 
the policy-making body includes three soldiers with the rank of brigadier and four colonels , plus a handful of civilians , including the secretary-general of the government and the Attorney-General . 
the statement said a cabinet would be announced later . 
a senior Western diplomat said the announcement was intended to reassure the army &apos;s lower ranks and the RUF who were opposed to a negotiated settlement . 
&quot; As they say , it &apos;s rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic , &quot; said the diplomat . 
&quot; We expect an agreement to be reached and if the RUF opposes it , the regional force will go for them . 
&quot; Nigeria , Ghana and Guinea have sent troops ready for a military strike if the talks fail .
