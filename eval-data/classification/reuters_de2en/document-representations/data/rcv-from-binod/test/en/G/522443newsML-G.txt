hooded gunmen held up an armoured van carrying the day takings of several French Riviera supermarkets and made off with up to 10 million francs ( $ 1.7 million ) without firing a shot , police sources said on Friday . 
the attack , carried out with military precision , took place on Thursday evening near Nice . 
the gunmen , some of whom wielded rocket launchers , fled after forcing the security guards to open the van and loading cash bags into three cars .
