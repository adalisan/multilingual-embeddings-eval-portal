most milling wheat futures prices on the Budapest commodity Exchange ( BCE ) went limit-up on Monday due to rosier export outlooks after the Czech and Polish floods , dealers said . 
&quot; ( The Czech Republic and Poland ) usually look at Slovakia to solve shortages , but these floods were the worst this century , &quot; said Dezso Kormendi of LaSalle . 
he added the floods left the Hungarian wheat crop unaffected and prices rose as the export outlook for the expected wheat surplus improved , breaking a nearly two-month downtrend . 
milling wheat futures rose the 400 forints per tonne limit for all positions except August , which closed 200 forints higher at 20,680 forints . 
September milling wheat finished at 20,960 forints , December at 22,400 and May at 24,700 . 
maize futures , which had a minimal turnover , were steady for all positions but October dropped 100 forints to 18,300 and Kormendi said the dormant maize market was only likely to see a revival when the first crop estimates arrive . 
barley futures were irregular with August remaining flat , September going limit-down and March limit-up , but Kormendi added these price movements were inconsequential as turnover was minimal . 
barley futures saw a total three lots turnover . 
total grains turnover edged up to a still below-average 556 lots or 242.51 million forints from Friday &apos;s 437 lots or 187.8 million forints . 
milling wheat accounted for the bulk of the turnover in volume terms with 323 lots . 
( lot size = 20,000 kgs $ = 191.20 Hungarian forints )
