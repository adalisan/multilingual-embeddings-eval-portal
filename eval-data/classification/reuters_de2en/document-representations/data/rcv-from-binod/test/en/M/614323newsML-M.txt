Belgian government bonds ( OLOs ) and futures recovered some of the ground lost on Monday in the wake of a surprise initial lead by the Left in France &apos;s parliamentary elections as prices hit buy levels , dealers said . 
it was now unclear whether there would be fresh markdowns in the course of the week as players prepared for next Sunday &apos;s second round of voting amid nervousness over the Left &apos;s plans regarding France &apos;s entry into EMU , they said . 
also , players would monitor the reaction to the first round result from the U.K. and the U.S. as both these markets resumed trade after today &apos;s one-day holidays there . 
apart from the technical levels prices were also supported by the Treasury &apos;s unexpectedly tight allocation in its monthly OLO auction BELA . 
the total of 23 billion francs on OLO 26 and 27 was about half the sum forecast by some . 
&quot; They kept the prices amazingly high , &quot; a trader said . 
she had expected all bids to have been awarded at the stop price of 101.75 . 
instead , the Treasury accepted only 62.8 percent . 
the auction &apos;s stop was a meagre discount to the 101.73 / 83 market bid / ask at 1455 GMT ( yield 6.001 percent ) BE286 = . 
but , dealers said , the slim award had the side-effect of supporting OLOs , causing the OLO / Bund spread MEUR to return to eight basis points after this morning &apos;s slight widening . 
the widening came as the mark gained on the French , and Belgian , franc after the election news . 
the mild pressure on the franc -- a continuation from last week -- kept Belgian money market rates relatively high TTFBXL . 
some said the National Bank was squeezing liquidity to help the currency . 
the central bank allocated a barely changed 15.05 billion francs of seven-day advances at an unchanged central rate of 3.00 percent at its weekly liquidity offer NBVA . 
the rate compares with a higher one-week market repo rate of 3.32 / 36 percent TTFBXL . 
dealers said that from here on it was hard to predict where prices were headed . 
&quot; The ( 10-year ) yield BE286 = will hang around 6.00 percent , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; This week will remain quiet , we will be waiting for the second round ( next Sunday ) , people will not be taking positions , &quot; another trader said . 
&quot; If there is confirmation ( of the Left &apos;s lead ) , next week could be lively . 
confirmation will revive fears that a new left-wing government in Paris might throw up blocks to Europe &apos;s economic and monetary union FR-EMU , which could force markets to unwind convergence trades . 
most analysts and EU officials , however , said the realities of the marketplace would prevent a French Socialist government from pursuing a radical shift in economic policies . 
they were confident that the thrust of past policies would not be changed .
