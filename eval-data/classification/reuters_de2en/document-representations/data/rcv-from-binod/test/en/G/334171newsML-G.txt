Morten Olsen , the former Danish international who is to replace Louis van Gaal as coach of Ajax Amsterdam next season , is a passionate perfectionist with clear ideas on how soccer should be played . 
&quot; Football should not just be result-orientated , &quot; the Belgium-based coach told Reuters in a telephone interview . 
&quot; The game has gone off at the wrong tangent in recent years . 
far too many trainers practise excessively defensive and cautious strategies . 
&quot; It is not just a question of winning , it is the way you do it . 
as a coach I want to be able to sit back and enjoy my team playing good , positive soccer . 
&quot; I want to work with a club with the right philosophy , a place where football is alive . 
Ajax certainly fit that bill despite their poor league form this season . 
they became European champions in 1995 and were beaten finalists last season , playing fluent exciting football with an exciting young side nurtured by the hugely successful van Gaal . 
but their appointment of Olsen is something of a suprise . 
the 47-year-old performed illustriously on the football pitch , playing a record 102 games for Denmark , but his managerial career has so far been mixed . 
as coach at top Danish side Brondby , where he was in charge for two years , Olsen crafted a side which reached the semifinals of the UEFA Cup -- the best achievement of a Danish club in European competition . 
in 1992 he moved to German side Cologne . 
after four seasons in charge and without a trophy to his name he was sacked in late 1995 . 
shortly before his appointment at Ajax Olsen told Danish television he wanted to become a leading club trainer again after an 18-month period in the cold . 
Olsen is still 
something of a hero in Denmark , despite his absence from the domestic football scene since 1989 . 
he began his playing career at Vordingborg , before moving to Nykoebing , both in south-west Denmark , and then to Cercle Brugge , Racing White Derek Molenbeek and Anderlecht in Belgium before ending his career as a player at Cologne . 
he became captain of the Danish national team in 1983 , contributing to Denmark &apos;s first ever qualification for the European championship in France in 1984 . 
he captained Denmark at the Mexico World Cup in 1986 , helping to place the team firmly among the world football elite . 
his swansong with the Danes was a 4-0 victory over Brazil in a friendly in Copenhagen in 1989 , in which he scored from a penalty . 
Olsen &apos;s club performances abroad were also distinguished . 
while he was at Anderlecht they twice won the Belgian championship and in 1983 won the UEFA Cup by beating Benfica 1-0 .
