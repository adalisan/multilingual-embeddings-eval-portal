the U.S. Navy will replace the aircraft carrier Independence , homeported in Yokosuka south of Tokyo , with the carrier kitty Hawk next year , a spokesman for the U.S. 
forces in Japan said on Tuesday . 
the 80,643-tonne Independence , the only U.S. carrier to be based abroad , has been a familiar ship in many Asian ports as a symbol of Washington &apos;s defence commitments to the region . 
nicknamed the &quot; Indy &quot; by its crew , it will retire in September 1998 after a last cruise across the Pacific to Honolulu in June 1998 , the spokesman said . 
the Independence was commissioned in 1959 and was one of the first U.S. aircraft carriers to be fitted with a British-designed angled flight deck and steam catapults , the hallmark of subsequent U.S. carriers . 
the 81,123-tonne kitty Hawk was commissioned in 1961 and like the Independence , is not one of the U.S. Navy &apos;s new nuclear-powered ships . 
named after the location of the world &apos;s first airplane flown by the Wright brothers , the kitty Hawk carries 72 warplanes , including F-14 Tomcat fighters and F / A-18 hornet attack planes . 
the kitty Hawk will first take part in the five-nation naval exercises called RIMPAC , to be held in waters around Hawaii , in July 1998 and then be rebased to Yokosuka in August 1998 , the spokesman said . 
the kitty Hawk will be the third U.S. Navy carrier to be based in Yokosuka after the Midway , which was retired in 1991 , and the Independence .
