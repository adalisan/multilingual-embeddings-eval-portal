riot police halted 30,000 students as they marched on Thursday towards the Belgrade home of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as part of their campaign with the political opposition to drive him from power . 
a cordon of police in riot armour halted the students under the windows of the embassy of the United States , which has threatened Milosevic with reprisals if he crushes the three-week-old anti-government demonstrations with force . 
although the demonstrations against socialist rigging of local elections on November 17 have been peaceful , the atmosphere became nervous as the students turned back and still more police appeared in side streets along the march route . 
the confrontation happened as Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini met Milosevic and leaders of the Zajedno ( Together ) coalition of opposition parties who claim the socialists cheated them of victory in Belgrade and 14 other towns . 
Dini &apos;s mission , apparently supported by the United States which has vowed to isolate Milosevic internationally , began as the opposition faced a critical test of its ability to mobilise mass street protests against Milosevic . 
daily demonstrations in Belgrade by Zajedno and the students , now in their fourth week , have shrunk to around half of the 150,000 people who turned out at their peak . 
the falling numbers eased the pressure on Milosevic to compromise on Zajedno &apos;s charge that the socialists used courts to disqualify Zajedno councillors for unspecified &quot; irregularities &quot; at the socialist-controlled polls in Belgrade and elsewhere . 
political sources said it was unlikely that Milosevic would budge on possession of the capital though he might pacify Zajedno by handing over other towns . 
the authorities have begun to take a tougher line since a young worker was arrested and beaten by police for carrying an effigfy of Milosevic in prison garb at a march last week . 
Belgrade actor Gojko Balotic , who was arrested during Wednesday &apos;s demonstration , was also beaten before being released with head and leg injuries , his wife told reporters . 
Milosevic earlier kept his police off the streets , apparently counting on the biggest protest movement he has faced during nine years in power running out of momentum . 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher told CBS television that Milosevic would doom his hopes of ties with the West if he continued his &quot; repressive , undemocratic stance . 
he added : &quot; ( Milosevic ) is really is turning his back on opportunities to join the West , which I know is important to him . 
the United States has considered re-imposing sanctions against Serbia which would be a severe economic blow to Milosevic after the European Union &apos;s refusal of preferential trade privileges for Serbia because of the election conflict . 
diplomatic sources said those messages would be forcefully repeated by Dini at his meeting with Milosevic and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic . 
the West has not so far fleshed out in detail what reprisals it might inflict on Milosevic if he does not yield . 
Zajedno has objected to the renewal of sanctions which would hurt ordinary Serbs more than the government . 
Milosevic is aware the the United States is unlikely to lift its veto on renewed International Monetary Fund membership ( IMF ) unless he makes concessions to the opposition far beyond what would be acceptable to his socialist hardliners . 
independent Yugoslav economists have calculated that the Yugoslav economy could survive for up to two years even under sanctions .
