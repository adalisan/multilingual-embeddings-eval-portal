economic growth in Asia has huge potential and is expected to show a slight increase this year before gradually picking up the pace in 1998 , the Japanese government said on Friday . 
&quot; Overall , the Asian region continues to have a strong labour base , capital has been growing with the support of foreign investment and productivity gains made on the back of technological progress can be foreseen -- it is difficult to see limits to growth , &quot; the government &apos;s Economic Planning Agency ( EPA ) said in its annual report on Asian economies . 
the report , which excludes Japan , said a drop-off in exports reduced growth in the Asian region in 1996 to 7.4 percent from 8.2 percent in 1995 , but the fall was likely to be temporary . 
export values suffered last year partly due to foreign exchange movements and to a slump in semiconductor prices , but the Asian region has yet to reach its potential in terms of exporting power , an Economic Planning Agency ( EPA ) official said . 
the report said that in 1997 , the newly industrialised economies of Hong Kong , Taiwan , Singapore and South Korea were expected to show slightly faster growth on average , while growth in China and ASEAN countries was expected to be flat overall . 
ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . 
focusing on East Asia , the EPA said in its summary that &quot; it was difficult to see any obstacles to sustained growth &quot; in the region . 
it added that East Asian countries continued to make technological progress after having taken measures to liberalise investment in trade and by emphasising market mechanisms . 
but it noted that there was still a large gap between newly industrialised economies and ASEAN economies , most of which continue to lag behind and some of which suffer from a critical shortage of technically skilled people .
