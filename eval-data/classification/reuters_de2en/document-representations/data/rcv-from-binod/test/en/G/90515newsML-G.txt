a British woman who decided to try to give birth to octuplets against doctors &apos; advice lost the last four of her babies on Wednesday , a hospital said . 
Mandy Allwood , 31 , lost three of her babies on Monday in the 19th week of her pregnancy . 
doctors said then that it would be a miracle if the rest survived . 
another baby died early on Wednesday and the last four were miscarried or delivered stillborn in the late afternoon . 
doctors at King &apos;s College Hospital in London , where she is being treated , said Allwood , a divorced single mother , had realised earlier in the day that she would lose all the babies . 
&quot; Mandy certainly this afternoon became more and more distraught and disappointed when it was becoming clear we were moving towards a final conclusion for all eight , &quot; consultant obstetrician Donald Gibb told a news conference . 
the dead foetuses , six boys and two girls , were laid in a cot beside Allwood &apos;s bed , with pink and blue tags according to their sex , her publicity agent Max Clifford said . 
she had cradled each of them . 
Allwood became pregnant with the eight babies after taking powerful fertility drugs and ignoring medical advice to avoid sex for a while . 
she was determined to try to bear them all despite medical advice that they would fail to survive or be born severely handicapped . 
doctors advised her it would be better to abort some of the foetuses to give the others a chance of survival but she refused . 
this week her friends said she had become so huge she could hardly walk , despite being only five months into the pregnancy . 
Allwood &apos;s decision to try to become the first woman in the world to give birth to eight babies made headlines in Britain and around the world . 
she won applause from anti-abortion groups , which said on Wednesday they were still convinced she had made the right choice . 
&quot; I am very glad that Mandy Allwood said no , &quot; said Jack Scarisbrick of Life . 
&quot; Her children died naturally and she did her best for them . 
the loss of the babies was less sad than the &quot; horrible technique &quot; of selective termination , he said . 
Clifford , who negotiated a controversial contract between Allwood and a tabloid newspaper that offered her one million pounds ( $ 1.5 million ) if all the babies were born alive , said she was also convinced she had done the right thing . 
&quot; She said to me that , given the position she was put in and the choice she was given , she would do exactly the same thing again , &quot; said Clifford . 
&quot; Knowing how desperate she is to have a baby with ( her partner ) Paul Hudson , I will be amazed if she doesn &apos;t try for another child , &quot; he added .
