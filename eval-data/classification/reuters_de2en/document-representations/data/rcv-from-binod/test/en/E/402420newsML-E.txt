Queensland state treasurer and deputy premier Joan Sheldon said on Tuesday the state &apos;s 1997 / 98 budget was aiming for no new or increased taxes and charges . 
&quot; We will be able to hold to these key parameters , providing the Commonwealth ( federal government ) does not further cut funding to Queensland and that departments meet their 1997 / 98 savings targets , &quot; Sheldon said in a statement . 
Sheldon earlier said the state budget for 1997 / 98 to June 30 was expected to be delivered on May 27 .
