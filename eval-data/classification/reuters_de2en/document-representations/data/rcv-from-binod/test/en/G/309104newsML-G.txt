the French Health Ministry said on Wednesday a woman infected with the virus that leads to AIDS had most probably been contaminated while being operated on by a surgeon who himself had the disease . 
the Pasteur Institute said it was only the second known case of a doctor infecting a patient , the first being when a Florida dentist who died of AIDS infected six of his patients . 
the Health Ministry said the surgeon in the latest case , named as Dr C. , was infected in 1983 while operating on a patient ill with AIDS . 
but it said he did not know he was HIV positive when he operated on the unnamed woman in 1992 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris . 
it said Dr C. said he had slightly cut himself through his surgery gloves during the operation and some of his blood was likely to have mixed with the patient &apos;s blood . 
it gave no other details . 
Florida dentist David ACER died of AIDS complications in 1990 and in the following year a woman became the first of his patients to succumb to the disease .
