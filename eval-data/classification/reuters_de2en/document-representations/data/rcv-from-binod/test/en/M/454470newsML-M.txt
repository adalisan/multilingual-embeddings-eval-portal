South African shares are expected to turn in a strong performance this year and next as the economy stabilises and lower interest and rand rates fuel future growth expectations , a Reuters survey showed . 
the mean of seven forecasts in an equities survey carried out last week showed the South African all-share index is expected to rise by 11.8 percent to 8,130 by the end of 1997 and by 27.9 percent to 9,936 by the end of 1998 from the close of 7168.1 on March 12 . 
these forecasts represent a rise in the all share index of 5.2 percent for end-1997 and of seven percent for end-1998 compared with a similar survey carried out three months ago . 
but I think the opinion is that perhaps in the second half of the year , one is looking for a decrease in interest rates and also for the economy to start biting a little more . 
&quot; The impact of the depreciated rand should start being seen in the economy in the second half of the year . 
&quot; We believe there is going to be some catching up in terms of last year &apos;s economic performance , because we believe the market underperformed to some extent compared to the economic performance the previous year . 
&quot; Towards the latter part of ( 1997 ) there will be some discounting in terms of a better expected economic performance in 1998 . 
the combination of these two aspects with the fairly good expected GDP performance of this year will boost the overall index up .
