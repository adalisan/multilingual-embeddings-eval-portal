Banco de Mexico said Tuesday its net international assets as of November 1 , 1996 were $ 4.378 billion , compared with $ 3.872 billion on October 25 . 
the central bank said its net international reserves as of November 1 were $ 16.122 billion , compared with $ 15.763 billion as of October 25 . 
it said the increase of $ 506 million in international assets in the week was due to : 
- Net revenues from operations with state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) worth $ 757 million ; 
- A net sale of foreign currency to the federal government , mainly for external debt service payments , worth $ 241 million ; 
- Net outgoings of $ 10 million from a combination of factors including changes in the dollar value of foreign exchange assets and liabilities held by the bank ; net returns on interest rates and from trading in metals and securities ; subscription of Bank of International Settlements shares ; and net deposits in dollar accounts of commercial banks at the central bank . 
Banco de Mexico said the monetary base rose by 4.430 billion pesos in the week due to seasonal demand for notes and coins stemming from salary payments for the second two weeks of October and the November 1 Day of the Dead celebrations . 
the balance of the federal government &apos;s account at the central bank rose by 4.553 billion pesos in the same period , mainly due to tax receipts . 
Central bank credit to financial institutions rose by 6.911 billion pesos to meet the rising demand for notes and coins and to compensate for the reduced liquidity caused by the increase in federal government deposits .
