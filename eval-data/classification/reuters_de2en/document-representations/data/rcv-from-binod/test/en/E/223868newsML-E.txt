Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Thursday the government would not be influenced by initial issues identified in its financial sector inquiry when making final recommendations . 
&quot; It is appropriate for the government not to pre-judge any of the issues identified by the inquiry at this stage , &quot; Costello said in a statement . 
the inquiry , headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis , left open the option of mergers among Australia &apos;s big banks and takeovers of local banks by foreign banks in an interim discussion paper released earlier on Thursday . 
the paper said the key aim of any reforms should be to increase the efficiency of Australia &apos;s banks to compete globally . 
it also said new technology would transform the sector . 
policy set by the previous Labor government has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia &apos;s four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups . 
the inquiry &apos;s final report is scheduled for release in March next year after further reviews .
