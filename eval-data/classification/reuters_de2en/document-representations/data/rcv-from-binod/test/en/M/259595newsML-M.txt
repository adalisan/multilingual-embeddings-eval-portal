the future for government bonds in emerging markets is bright next year and some analysts predict local currency investments will provide the really glowing returns in 1997 . 
the danger is U.S. interest rates . 
assuming they , and rates in other industrial countries , stay relatively low , then the demand for higher yields will force funds and other major investors to increase their allocations to emerging markets , the analysts said . 
the sort of meteoric rises seen in 1996 may not be repeated , but they said yields should still be alluringly high . 
a recent survey by Merrill Lynch showed that investors expect emerging market fixed income to return around 15 percent on average next year . 
that compares with close to 40 percent this year , with some , such as Russian debt , surging more than 100 percent . 
&quot; Assuming U.S. interest rates stay put or don &apos;t rise much , the outlook is good but you won &apos;t have the same sort of increases as in the past year , &quot; West Merchant Bank economic adviser Peter West said . 
even if yields on U.S. Treasury bonds do go a bit higher , the market should be able to cope , said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell head of emerging market research , Paul Luke . 
he cited lower interest rates in Japan and West Europe , likely higher credit ratings for several developing countries and the amortisation of some Brady bonds as factors supporting the market . 
however , spreads over U.S. treasuries do not have the same room to narrow and the big capital gains of past debt reschedulings are all but over . 
the last big one is Russia , which is restructuring more than $ 30 billion with commercial banks , in a deal expected to be closed by the end of March . 
the Brady bond market , created seven years ago with U.S. backing to reschedule massive sovereign debt defaults , is a declining asset class , though far from dead . 
West said Bradys were becoming indistinguishable from Eurobonds and noted the increasing number of deals by debtor countries to repackage their Bradys and take them out of the market . 
it also means more investors are prepared to take such instruments into their portfolios . 
the improving economic management in so many countries , where political leaders have taken on board the lessons of Mexico &apos;s peso crisis in late 1994 , are making it that much easier to tempt in big investors . 
ANZ &apos;s head emerging markets economist , Jerome Booth , said there could even be a surge in January as fund managers adjust their allocations to take on more emerging marlets debt at the start of the year . 
for him , and a number of other analysts , it was the booming local currency markets in fixed income which could sparkle . 
&quot; Local currencies are the next frontier . 
they will grow and grow ... as Bradys get more fairly priced , people will look more at local markets , &quot; Booth said .
