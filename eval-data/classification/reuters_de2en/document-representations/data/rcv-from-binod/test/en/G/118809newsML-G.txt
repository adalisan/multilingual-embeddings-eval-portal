Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres appealed to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday to exert a positive influence on Jakarta to improve what he described as &quot; intolerable conditions &quot; in East Timor . 
Guterres was speaking in an interview with German radio ahead of a visit by Kohl to Indonesia from October 25 to 29 . 
a German government spokesman said on Monday that Kohl planned to raise human rights issues with government leaders in Jakarta . 
&quot; Of course we do not want our friends and allies like Germany to break off relations with Indonesia . 
on the contrary , we would like these countries to exert a positive influence on Indonesia as far as possible , &quot; Guterres told the radio . 
&quot; The present situation can not be tolerated for much longer and we are counting on our friends and allies , for example Germany , to help to change things , &quot; he said . 
Indonesian troops invaded East Timor in December 1975 and Jakarta formally annexed it in July 1976 . 
the United Nations does not recognise Indonesian rule in East Timor and regards former colonial ruler Portugal as the administering power . 
Portugal backs the demands of resistance groups that East Timor , which is Roman Catholic while Indonesia is Moslem , should have the right to decide freely on its future . 
Guterres said he had personally failed up to now to bring the Indonesian President Suharto into a &quot; constructive dialogue &quot; over granting Timor the right to self-determination during negotiations organised by the United Nations . 
&quot; We have completely different positions on this issue . 
but both sides are prepared to discuss specific ways of improving the dramatic living conditions of these people , who live under military occupation deprived of the most basic rights . 
&quot; Indonesia is not changing its policy on these issues , &quot; Gueterres said . 
&quot; This is precisely where the position of an allied country like Germany , an international political heavyweight which is influential in the region , is important &quot; . 
Guterres echoed the words of Jose Ramos-Horta , an East Timor independence activist , who jointly with East Timor &apos;s Catholic Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo , was last week awarded the 1996 Nobel Peace prize his efforts to establish peace there . 
Ramos-Horta told German radio on Monday : &quot; No other country in Europe has the weight , the influence on Indonesia as Germany &quot; .
