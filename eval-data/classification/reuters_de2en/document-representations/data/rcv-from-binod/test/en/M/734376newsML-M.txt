Malaysia &apos;s spot tin price fell six cents to 13.79 ringgit ( $ 5.38 ) a kg on Wednesday after players sold heavily on the metal due to an overnight slump on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) , traders said . 
the weaker ringgit against the U.S. dollar still made Malaysian tin attractive , said the traders . 
&quot; But the LME tin was down too sharply , so our market had to follow , &quot; said a trader . 
the local price was at a premium of $ 15 a tonne against the LME after being on par on Tuesday . 
traders noted initial bids for 68 tonnes against offers for 139 . 
final turnover was 71 tonnes , down from 217 on Tuesday , and was absorbed by Europeans , Japanese and locals .
