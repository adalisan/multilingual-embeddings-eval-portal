the Hindustan Times 
though Congress president Sitaram Kesri &apos;s election as Parliamentary Party ( CPP ) leader is a foregone conclusion , supporters of former prime minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao &apos;s will ensure it is not a smooth affair . 
Rao loyalists put up Rajesh Pilot as their candidate , defying the Congress Working Committee &apos;s consensus choice Kesri for the CPP post . 
they said they would express their opposition to the absence of secret ballot at the CPP general body when it meeets to formally elect the new leader on Friday . 
Indian Express 
with Congress party president Sitaram Kesri all set to take over the reins of the Congress Parliamentary Party ( CPP ) , the countdown for the fall of Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda &apos;s government has begun . 
having ruled out the possibility of an immediate withdrawal of support to the United Front government , Kesri would prefer to wait for an opportune time before striking . 
Gowda &apos;s meeting with former prime minister Rao , on the eve of the crucial Congress Working Committee meeting to resolve the CPP leadership tangle , strengthened Kesri &apos;s belief that a coterie around Gowda was egging Rao loyalists to queer his pitch . 
the Times Of India 
the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) ( CPM ) general secretary Harkishan Singh Surjeet made it clear that the party would continue to remain outside the United Front government . 
but West Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu , India &apos;s longest reigning communist chief minister , reiterated his view that the CPM had made a mistake by not joining the coalition government . 
he was referring to his earlier comment that the CPM had made a historical blunder by not joining the government . 
Basu &apos;s comment had created a controversy in political circles , especially the CPM , which had decided to support the government from outside without taking part in it . 
the Economic Times 
the upper limit on the special reserve which public financial institutions ( FIS ) create to make use of a tax exemption on income will be hiked with effect from April 1 , 1997 . 
the limit will go up from the current twice the paid-up equity capital level to twice the paid-up equity capital and general reserves of financial institutions from the next fiscal . 
FIS are given a 40 percent tax exemption on income from such business of providing long-term finance by creating a special reserve . 
Suzuki Motor Company is negotiating with the government to increase its stake in Maruti Udyog ( MUL ) to 74 percent . 
the government has climbed down from its earlier stand on reducing its stake in MUL and selling it off to Suzuki , following the trend towards pulling out of non-core areas like automobiles . 
if the plan comes through , Suzuki intends to invest over 50 billion rupees and set up several plants in the country in addition to its current expansion programme . 
an annual increase of 20 billion rupees is expected in the food subsidy bill . 
this is a result of the government &apos;s decision to provide wheat and rice to 65 million families below the poverty line at half the prices . 
the budget estimate for food subsidy for the current fiscal is 57.74 billion rupees . 
although there is a proposal to increase the central issue prices for rice and wheat to check the mounting subsidy bill , experts feel the government may not resort to a hike in an uncertain political scenario . 
the government initiated a political dialogue in favour of another price hike of petro-products . 
Prime Minister DEVE Gowda met Opposition and Left leaders during the past fortnight in this regard . 
official sources said the oil ministry ruled out raising petrol and aviation turbine fuel prices which were already priced much higher than actual . 
the ministry proposed a hike of about 20 percent in diesel , LPG and kerosene , which formed the bulk of the subsidy , as well as other items like fuel oil . 
sources said the strategy was aimed at keeping the oil pool account deficit in check at the current level of around 95 billion rupees . 
ASEA Brown Boveri ( ABB ) is taking an estimated 45 percent stake in the 41.9 billion rupee north Madras power project , replacing Edisson Mission Energy of the US . 
Videocon , who is developing the project , is retaining its 55 percent stake . 
this is the first power project where ABB is picking up a substantial stake . 
the project operates under a debt-equity ratio of 70 : 30 and ABB &apos;s contribution would amount to an estimated six billion rupees . 
ABB was not given any equity stake earlier , even though it was executing the engineering , procurement and construction contract for the project , as Videocon did not want to dilute its own equity . 
business Standard 
the rupee depreciated considerably against the dollar , closing at 35.915-935 . 
this was 0.08 rupee higher than the prevnious close of 35.84-85 . 
the drop was sparked by the entry of the State Bank of India ( SBI ) in the inter-bank foreign exchange market . 
dealers said the SBI was buying the dollars for its corporate customers . 
the last time the rupee slipped to below 35.90 was on Monday . 
the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) would soon revise accounting rules for foreign currency assets and liabilities of commercial banks . 
it would ask banks to reveal their exposures both in Indian rupees and foreign exchange . 
this accounting policy would replace the practices laid down in 1987 . 
at present , banks convert their foreign currency assets and liabilities into rupees on March 31 every year and show them in the balance sheet . 
now the plan is to ask banks to also show the actual assets and liabilities in foreign currency . 
this would clearly show if the bank has benefited or been hit by fluctuations in exchange rates . 
the economy is likely to be liberalised further in the near future . 
Prime minister DEVE Gowda is understood to have given finance minister P Chidambaram the green signal to go ahead on further liberalising the economy , ignoring the protests of Left partners . 
Gowda &apos;s move is aimed at keeping Chidambaram and the Tamil Maanila Congress on his side and denying the Congress an excuse to withdraw support . 
some areas that could be affected by fresh doses of liberalisation are insurance , banking , import tariffs , pharmaceuticals , roads , ports and railways . 
financial Express 
the income tax department has asked 56 financial services companies to furnish details of all sale and lease back transactions entered by them in the previous four years . 
the Observer 
the government is planning to launch some of the public sector undertakings ( PSUs ) as multinational companies . 
it has proposed to empower some PSUs to acquire finance , state-of-the-art technology and professional mangement . 
oil and Natural Gas Corporation , Bharat Heavy Eelectricals Ltd , Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd , Mahanagar telephone Nigam Ltd , Indian Oil Corporation and Steel Authority of Indian Ltd are among the PSUs being considered under this plan . 
the government has also proposed to help these companies merge group companies or acquire other PSUs working in related areas in order to strengthen their core competencies and acquire the global size . 
India plans to waive quantitative restrictions on imports , including consumer goods , on its own terms . 
despite pressure from the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , commerce ministry officials favour this approach as the risk of uncertainties on the balance of payments front continues . 
India was asked by the WTO to propose a time-table to waive quantitative restrictions on imports . 
a proposal is being prepared by the commerce ministry to remove all quantitative restrictions in a phased manner over the next five years . 
the president of the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ) , who met the prime minister recently , was optimistic and hopeful about the government &apos;s approval for revival of the carry-forward system . 
it was for the first time that the president of a stock exchange had been invited for discussion by the prime minister . 
the BSE chief submitted a number of suggestions to the prime minister for the revival of the capital markets . 
he said the prime minister had taken interest in the proposal to revive carry forward and had asked for a detailed report on the subject . 
business Line 
the government plans to permit Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) to enter the domestic aviation market in a joint venture with the Tata group . 
sources said this was likely to be announced in the budget session of Parliament , since the initial stand opposing the entry of foreign airlines was made on the floor of the House . 
Tata-SIA has been waiting since 1995 to launch a domestic airline . 
it was initially opposed by the previous civil aviation minister on the ground that the infrastructure in Indian airports was inadequate .
