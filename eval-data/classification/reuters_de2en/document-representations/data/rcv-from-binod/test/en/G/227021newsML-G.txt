Ajax Amsterdam &apos;s miserable Dutch league season continued on Sunday when the defending champions were held 1-1 after Groningen &apos;s Dean Gorre scored a late equaliser . 
Ajax dropped to sixth in the first division , 13 points behind leaders PSV Eindhoven , who beat NEC Nijmegen 4-1 on Saturday and have 42 points from 18 matches . 
the Amsterdam team launched an early siege that was rewarded with a ninth minute goal from Ronald de Boer but Groningen , hovering just above the relegation zone , showed resolution . 
Ajax &apos;s main problem , apart from constant injuries , is their repeated squandering of chances , though Patrick Kluivert did get the ball in the net midway through the second half , only for his effort to be disallowed for offside . 
Groningen striker Harris Huizingh troubled the Ajax defence , crucially missing injured skipper Danny Blind and Frank de Boer , and it was finally breached in the 81st minute . 
they failed to clear a Groningen attack efficiently , allowing Gorre the chance to fire the equaliser . 
Ajax , who were knocked out of the Dutch Cup by second division side Heracles in midweek , face a vital last game in the European Cup Champions &apos; League on Wednesday against grasshopper Zurich , with a quarter-final place at stake . 
Ajax coach Luis van Gaal said the result on Wednesday would depend on the morale of his players . 
&quot; In the dressing room I have seen very disappointed players , &quot; he said . 
however , there is optimism that Frank de Boer will be fit enough to face the Swiss side .
