two of Eastern Europe &apos;s last ex-communist governments , in Bulgaria and in Yugoslavia , are under pressure from protests gathering thousands of people daily in defiance of riot police and freezing temperatures . 
but while Belgraders are in the streets to demand greater democracy and an end to one-party rule , Bulgarians -- who enjoy political pluralism -- are protesting against more fundamental problems of poverty and crime . 
&quot; We should not forget that the protests in Serbia are based mainly on political demands and the protests here are based on economic factors and social discontent , &quot; said Bulgaria &apos;s anti-communist president Zhelyu Zhelev . 
&quot; The difference is clear as the average salary in Serbia is $ 200 and in Bulgaria it is $ 30 . 
Serbia &apos;s opposition prides itself that after eight straight weeks , its style of peaceful , inventive and deafening mass protests has been adopted around the world . 
&quot; We have become a world school of peaceful democratic protests , &quot; one leader of the Zajedno opposition coalition , Zoran Djindjic , told a rally in Belgrade last week . 
&quot; In Bulgaria , the Bulgarian opposition has taken up our model of whistles and eggs in an attempt to topple the Communists . 
Anastasia Moser , head of Bulgaria &apos;s opposition Agrarian Party , agreed their supporters had taken their inspiration from television pictures of Belgrade , and said she was confident they could hold out as long . 
&quot; The rallies are becoming more and more numerous every day , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Participation is growing because public discontent is growing also . 
in Bulgaria , the end of one-party rule has meant big price rises and a sharp increase in violent crime , a shock to pensioners who make up nearly a quarter of the population and traditionally vote Socialist in hope of a return to the &quot; good old days &quot; . 
the election of opposition lawyer Petar Stoyanov to the Bulgarian presidency in November marked the start of a wave of opposition to the ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party ( BSP ) , which headed seven of Bulgaria &apos;s eight governments since the end of communist rule in 1989 . 
&quot; If the BSP sees this as a coup d &apos;etat , the united opposition sees it as the justified wrath of people who took to the streets because they are hungry and see no future for themselves , &quot; Stoyanov , who is due to be sworn in next Sunday , said on Saturday after meeting European ambassadors in Sofia . 
&quot; I asked ambassadors what would the citizens of their countries do if their monthly wages were between $ 16 and $ 20 and the price of bread is $ 0.50 , &quot; Stoyanov said . 
annual inflation of more than 300 percent has eroded Bulgarians &apos; real incomes but the small Balkan state of 8.4 million people is a far more free society than Yugoslavia . 
elections are held without interference , newspapers are outspoken in their criticism of the government and state television has shown dramatic footage of the protests . 
Serbian state media barely mention the protests except to describe them as a foreign plot to destabilise the state , and the government at one stage took private radio station B-92 , which offers daily live coverage of the protests , off the air . 
a main difference between the two is that Serbian communists , home-grown rather than imposed by Moscow , have ruled without interruption in Belgrade since 1945 , surviving the 1989 revolutions in Eastern Europe intact . 
when one-party rule started collapsing elsewhere in the late 1980s , the communists in Belgrade under Slobodan Milosevic re-formed as Socialists , then whipped up national fervour , invoked a siege mentality and tightened their grip on the state media . 
Bulgaria &apos;s veteran communist leader Todor Zhivkov was overthrown in 1989 but leading communists reformed as the Socialist party , continuing to rule apart from a brief 11-month interlude in 1991-92 . 
while in both countries the protests have united squabbling opposition parties , it remains to be seen whether the Socialists &apos; lifelong critics can provide the political and economic leadership necessary to form governments , but their supporters are determined they should have the chance . 
&quot; We want the whole world to see our suffering and the arrogance of the Socialists , &quot; said Sofia opposition protester Stoyan Georgiev . 
&quot; They will not frighten us with the brutality of the police because we have chosen our future , and in our future Socialists no longer exist .
