Russia &apos;s central bank is confident it will receive all the money due in 1996 under an International Monetary Fund $ 10 billion loan by the end of this year , bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said on Friday . 
&quot; We are supposed to get three tranches by January 1 , 1997 , and we are confident that we will get them , &quot; he told a news conference . 
on Thursday the central bank said an IMF mission was leaving Moscow after failing to reach agreement with Russian officials about the latest tranche of the loan . 
the main point of disagreement was Russia &apos;s poor performance in tax collection . 
tax revenues in the first nine months of this year were only 74 percent of budgeted levels for the period . 
the mission is due to return in the first half of November . 
Dubinin said that next month the mission would monitor the economic situation in both October and November to see whether there was any improvement in tax collection and other issues . 
&quot; We simply must solve the tax problem . 
too much depends on it , and all the resources available to the state will be thrown at this , &quot; Dubinin said .
