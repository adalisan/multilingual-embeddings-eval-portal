the UK stock market , weakened by pressure on drug and oil stocks , took a sharp dive on Wednesday after Wall Street dropped almost 50 points on profit-taking and worries about Russian President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s health . 
the FTSE 100 share index had pushed as high as 4,037.9 points in the first minutes of trade on Wednesday but retreated quickly to spend much of the day marooned around 4,025 points in quiet range trading . 
but the Dow &apos;s slide , exacerbated by rumours about Yeltsin , weighed on the FTSE in late afternoon dealing , driving the index lower to end at 4,009.3 , down 26.3 points on the day .
