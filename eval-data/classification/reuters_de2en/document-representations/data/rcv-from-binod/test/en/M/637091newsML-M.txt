implied volatilities for U.S. debt options finished the session slightly lower Wednesday , suggesting the market anticipates more range trading ahead , options brokers said . 
July Treasury bond volatility ended near 8.7 percent , down from 9.0 percent on the opening and slightly below the previous day &apos;s close . 
September was unchanged at 8.5 percent after sticking close to that level all day . 
some traders expressed surprise that bond volatility rates were not budging farther before Friday &apos;s May U.S. employment report , although the old pattern of values rising before the data has faltered in recent months . 
&quot; going into what is historically a very volatile number , I would think we should be much higher in terms of volatility , &quot; said a floor broker for a U.S. house . 
&quot; That says people think we will continue to trade in this range . 
volatility crept up last week , then stalled as the underlying futures encountered stubborn resistance above 110-00 . 
September bond futures settled at 110-01 , down 2 / 32 , after earlier edging up to a three-week high of 110-05 . 
the contract has been unsuccessful in several attempts this week to extend gains beyond a band of resistance stretching to 110-12 , and the waning momentum has capped volatility , traders and analysts said . 
below the market , good support is seen at the 200-day moving average at 109-23 , the bond floor broker said . 
he predicted volatility would attract a short-term bid if September futures finally vaulted the upside roadblocks and a much stronger bid on a downside breakout . 
traders said the day &apos;s highlight in bond options was a New York dealer firm &apos;s purchase of 4,000 September 109-00 puts . 
in Eurodollars , the biggest transaction involved one firm &apos;s straddle buying to cover a previously established short volatility position . 
the firm bought a total of 12,000 September 94.00 straddles over the past two sessions , helping volatility for the month gain 0.1 point to 9.0 percent , brokers said . 
December volatility also climbed slightly , to 10.9 percent .
