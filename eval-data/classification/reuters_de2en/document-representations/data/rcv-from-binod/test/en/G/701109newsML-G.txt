Canadian Formula One racing driver Jacques Villeneuve is set to leave the Williams team and race for his own Grand Prix team in 1999 , according to reports published in British weekly magazines on Wednesday . 
Villeneuve , 26 , second in the drivers &apos; championship behind Michael Schumacher of Ferrari , is linked to a proposed Formula One &apos; superteam &apos; to be created by British racing car constructor Reynard and the British-American Tobacco ( BAT ) company . 
the reports also said Villeneuve would take a shareholding in the team . 
Villeneuve won the Indianapolis 500 and the Indy Car World Series drivers &apos; title driving a Reynard car in 1995 and he and his manager Craig pollock have maintained a strong relationship with the constructor , and BAT , ever since . 
a five-year deal between the two , worth 175 million pounds sterling ( $ 290.4 million ) , has been agreed , according to the weekly magazines Autocar and motoring News . 
Villeneuve and Williams were not available for comment on Wednesday when the magazines also reported that the new team , identified as BA Team Reynard , had agreed a two-year deal with the French engine-tuners Mecachrome , based in Bourges , for a supply of ex-Renault V10 engines . 
Reynard managing director Rick Gorne admitted his company have been in discussions with BAT though nothing has been finalised . 
&quot; At the moment , the official line is that we are just one of many companies being considered by BAT , if they decide to pursue a Formula One venture , &quot; said Gorne . 
&quot; We would definitely consider entering Formula One , but only if we have all the right pieces in place , including the budget , drivers , engine and tyre package . 
&quot; At the moment , the story is all speculation and people are jumping the gun . 
the magazines suggested also that the new team would attempt to buy the existing Italian Formula One team Minardi at the end of this year . 
Minardi struggled financially in 1996 , but has gained support this year from Benetton managing director Flavio Briatore and the increased revenue from Formula One &apos;s television rights sales as agreed in the new 1997 Concorde Agreement . 
the magazines said the new team would want to buy Minardi in order to participate immediately in the sport with guaranteed income from television rights . 
but any purchase of an existing team , followed by a name change , would need the support of all the other signatories to the existing agreement if they were to become a signatory , and beneficiary , of the agreement . 
Reynard have attempted to enter Formula One before . 
team owner Adrian Reynard launched a project in the late 1980 &apos;s , designed and built a car , but abandoned the programme because of its cost in 1991 after 18 months work . 
it was then that he and his company switched their interest to the United States where they have enjoyed great success since . 
Villeneuve is in the second year of his contract with Williams to race in Formula One . 
it is understood that Williams have an option on his services for 1998 and have exercised that option , but have yet to reach final agreement on the details of their renewed deal with him .
