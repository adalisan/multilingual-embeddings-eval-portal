U.S. consular officials in Shanghai on Monday visited U.S. businessman William Ping Chen , who was jailed last month for 10 years for illegally importing garbage into China , a U.S. consulate spokesman said . 
Chen , born in Shanghai and now a resident of Oakland , California , was sentenced to deportation and a 500,000 yuan ( $ 60,000 ) fine as well as the jail term after confessing to smuggling 238 tonnes of garbage and medical waste into Shanghai . 
he has appealed against the sentence . 
the consular official said he had no further information about Chen or when his appeal would be heard . 
an official from the Shanghai People &apos;s High Court also said he had no new information on the case . 
Chen , 56 , was arrested in June last year and was sentenced following a hearing on December 2 . 
the official Xinhua news agency said he pleaded guilty to the charges . 
Chen &apos;s arrest was the climax of an emotional campaign launched by China in mid-1996 over illegal shipments of U.S. garbage listed as waste paper for recycling but found to contain old clothes , rubber gloves , and disposable syringes . 
Chen had listed the imports as waste paper and mixed paper , and proceeded with the shipments despite warnings from Shanghai environmental officials and opposition from his Chinese joint venture partners , Xinhua said .
