German police evacuated hundreds of people from their homes in a western town in the early hours of Wednesday morning after they discovered a stolen car they feared could contain a bomb near a British barracks . 
police said the car , standing in a residential street near the British air force barracks in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Niederkruechten , was being searched by German and British bomb experts on the scene . 
police said they had opened the car and found no immediate signs of a bomb , but said they were still checking to see if an explosive device could be hidden in or around the vehicle , adding the probe could last until 6 a.m. ( 0400 GMT ) . 
the car , with British numberplates , was registered as stolen on March 24 and noticed by military officers patrolling the residential area near the base where many British air force personnel and their families live , along with some Germans . 
the bomb alarm was raised after a dog trained by the British to detect explosives barked on inspecting the car . 
police said they had evacuated between 300 and 400 people from a 200-metre ( yards ) radius around the car and said the evacuees were sheltering in public buildings near the local school . 
they also said an underground gas pipe running under the car had been cut off for safety &apos;s sake . 
British barracks in Germany have been the target in recent years of bomb attacks by the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) guerrilla force , which opposes British rule of Northern Ireland . 
on Tuesday IRA bomb suspect Roisin McAliskey , who has been held in Britain since last year pending extradition to Germany for questioning about an 1996 IRA mortar attack at a British army base in Osnabrueck , was granted bail . 
peace talks resumed on Tuesday in the Northern Ireland capital Belfast after a three-month break due to last month &apos;s British general election . 
Sinn Fein , the political wing of the IRA , are not being included in the talks because the IRA has failed to declare a new ceasefire . 
its last ceasefire ended in February 1996 with a wave of bomb atttacks in London .
