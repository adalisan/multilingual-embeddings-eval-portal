expectations for Italian industrial production have been gloomy even though leading indicators still show signs of recovery , Italian private research group IRS said . 
according to latest IRS monthly data , the outlook for industrial output in March was flat to slightly negative although leading indicators looking ahead to April showed a slight upturn . 
IRS noted that the last time the indicators showed such a divergence was at the beginning of 1993 which marked the start of the last cycle of economic recovery . 
it said turbulence on financial markets at that time had influenced the decision of industrialists to boost output . 
&quot; But in 1993 came the devaluation of the lira which pulled growth upwards while today there seems to be no support for recovery . 
IRS said that after a considerable improvement in January , expectations of industrialists in February about the trend in orders remained flat at positive levels , but the number who reckoned the level of their stocks was too high had increased slightly .
