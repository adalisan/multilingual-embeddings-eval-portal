refugees voting in Bosnia &apos;s local polls in September will not get special protection to visit their former homes , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) said on Thursday . 
to avoid incidents between refugees and people living in contested areas , refugees will have to take special buses to polling stations designated for them , David Foley said . 
&quot; All voters , when they register to vote , will be assigned to a polling station and , unlike last year , they will not be able to vote at any available polling station in their former municipality , &quot; he said . 
thousands of people are expected to cross former front lines and cast votes in the troubled municipal polls , already postponed twice , in towns they fled or were expelled from during 3-1 / 2 years of war . 
&quot; I want to make it very clear that election weekend September 13-14 will not be a weekend to visit former homes for those who might choose to cross the Inter-Entity Boundary Line ( IEBL ) , &quot; a spokesman for the organisation told reporters . 
a peace agreement stopped the fighting in November 1995 and the de facto border divides the country into a Moslem-Croat federation and the Serb republic . 
OSCE , charged with supervising the polls , had already announced that voter registration for September polls is scheduled to begin on May 5 and last for six weeks . 
&quot; It is fundamental that all voters give appropriate consideration to a number of issues in choosing for which municipality they want to vote and whether to do so in person or by absentee ballot , &quot; David Foley said . 
&quot; No one should make their decision in the mistaken belief that they will be receiving some kind of special protection that will allow them to visit their former homes if they are crossing the IEBL , &quot; Foley said . 
elections for all levels of government were held last September except for the municipal level because of widespread irregularities in voter registration in Serb and Croat areas . 
the local polls are viewed as a last chance to stitch the divided country together and reverse the results of wartime ethnic expulsions by enabling refugees to elect authorities in their former towns . 
Bosnia &apos;s last elections confirmed the Serb , Croat and Moslem nationalist parties &apos; grip on power and analyst say the same can be expected in the local polls unless the country sees substantial progress in freedom of movement , return of refugees and democratisation .
