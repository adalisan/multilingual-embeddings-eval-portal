Israel successfully test fired a U.S.-financed arrow 2 anti-missile missile over the Mediterranean on Tuesday , a spokeswoman said . 
&quot; According to initial results , all systems including the radar worked correctly . 
the test was successful and now is being analysed , &quot; an Israel Aircraft Industries ( IAI ) spokeswoman told Reuters . 
she said the arrow hit its target , which was fired four minutes earlier at about 2 p.m. ( 1200 GMT ) . 
Tuesday &apos;s launch was the fourth arrow 2 test . 
it focused on radar and command and control systems . 
the spokeswoman said further trials could be carried out after analysis of test data . 
the missile was last tested in August 1996 . 
development of the arrow is jointly financed by the United States and Israel . 
security sources estimate the countries have poured $ 500 million into the project since 1991 . 
the projected cost is $ 1.6 billion but analysts say the missile could cost many times that figure . 
Israel receives $ 1.8 billion in annual U.S. military grants . 
an agreement between the two countries gives the United States access to the arrow &apos;s research and development data . 
project officials say an operational version of the missile will be ready in 1998 , 10 years after the programme began . 
the arrow started as part of the U.S. Strategic Defence Initiative , or &quot; Star Wars &quot; , but took off on its own when Iraq fired dozens of Scud missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War . 
Iraqi missiles caused few casualties but the psychological effect on Israelis and the ineffectiveness of U.S. Patriot missiles in intercepting Scuds made missile defence a priority . 
the arrow &apos;s radar , developed by a subsidiary of IAI , is designed to track missiles and guide the arrow at a speed of nearly three kms ( two miles ) per second to within four metres ( 13 FT ) of an incoming missile . 
the arrow is supposed to intercept missiles between 10 km ( six miles ) and 40 km ( 25 miles ) above the ground .
