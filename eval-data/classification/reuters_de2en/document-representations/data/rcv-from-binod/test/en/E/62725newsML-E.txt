Australian imports rose by one percent in August , the Australian Bureau of Statistics said . 
economists &apos; median forecast had been for a 2.2 percent rise , with forecasts ranging from a 1.0 percent fall to a 5.0 percent rise . 
the number suggests the current account ( deficit ) will be probably pretty similar to last month , probably around the A $ 1.3 billion mark . 
it still indicates ... that the tone of econonic activity is still softish . 
clearly we got a biggish rise in consumer goods imports . 
the trend there has been flat to negative over the past three months . 
capital goods came back a bit , but that &apos;s after two very big falls and that does include that Qantas aircraft , and coupled with the decline in intermediates , it still suggests to me that the tone of private spending is still pretty soft . 
the big story for us is that imports remain soft , it &apos;s a reflection of a soft economy , and we think the Reserve Bank will have to move on monetary policy before Christmas just to get the place going again . 
&quot; They were a bit softer than I thought they would be . 
I was looking for a bit more of a rebound , especially after the weakness we have seen in recent months . 
it will tend to keep alive market expectations of monetary policy easing after the November Reserve Bank board meeting as it suggests that economic activity is still in a somewhat softer patch . 
&quot; If you exclude aircraft capital imports have fallen in the last four months , part of that is the price effect ( of the Australian dollar &apos;s appreciation ) . 
it &apos;s just generally consistent with the slow patch in the economy . 
current account deficit forecast - A $ 1.2 billion , another good number with a bounceback in exports in all probability . 
&quot; On the surface , the market should take the data quite positively . 
it seems to suggest the economy is relatively soft . 
but we would be cautious as we think capital imports will pick up over the coming months .
