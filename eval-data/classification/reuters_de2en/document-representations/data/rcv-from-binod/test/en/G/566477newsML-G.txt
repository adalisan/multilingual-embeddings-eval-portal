this is not the O.J. 
case . 
from putting drill bits and a phone card into evidence to offering up heart-wrenching testimony and painting a portrait of a man at war with his government , the prosecution in the Oklahoma City bombing case is quickly building its case . 
legal experts say the prosecution against 29-year-old Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh could be completed within three weeks -- much faster than expected -- if the prosecution maintains the serious , no nonsense approach it has delivered in the first two weeks of the case . 
their presentation is in sharp contrast to the prosecution meandering and battles with the defence that marked the O.J. 
Simpson double-murder case , a case that many Americans have , for good or ill , equated with how the justice system works . 
one legal expert said the bombing case prosecution &apos;s team-like professionalism is aided by a judge who is in complete charge and who takes no nonsense from lawyers -- even to the point of barring lawyers from talking to the press and putting their spin on a day &apos;s proceedings . 
in stark contrast , the Simpson murder case was a never-ending media circus . 
&quot; Federal Judge Richard Matsch , in contrast to Simpson case Judge Lance ITO , exercises complete control over the courtroom . 
he &apos;s really trying to keep control of the trial , &quot; said Robert Precht , director of the Office of Public Service at the University of Michigan Law School . 
the prosecution strategy is to alternate between the dull and the dramatic -- between putting drill bits and a padlock into evidence to bringing on McVeigh &apos;s own sister to testify . 
&quot; I think they are trying to choreograph it to make it focused and as interesting as they can . 
it &apos;s looking very smooth , &quot; said William Pizzi , a professor at the University of Colorado Law School and a former federal prosecutor . 
&quot; What the prosecution is trying to do in the courtroom is keep the jurors interested . 
they go from dramatic to dry to dramatic , &quot; said Precht . 
prosecutors are building their case against McVeigh by introducing circumstantial evidence they claim proves a conspiracy to build a bomb and then plant it at the Alfred P. Murrah federal building . 
that circumstantial evidence includes drill holes found on a padlock protecting dynamite sticks that were stolen to a pre-paid telephone calling card to fingerprints found on receipts for motel bills and a huge purchase of fertiliser that could have been used to build the bomb . 
the prosecution has also presented some very emotional testimony from people who were working in the Murrah building on April 19 , 1995 when the blast occurred , killing 168 people . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very cleverly scripted strategy , &quot; Precht said and one very much in contrast to the World Trade Centre bombing trial where the prosecution presented scientific and physical evidence before introducing the human element . 
the first witness the prosecution presented was Lou Klaver , an attorney with the Oklahoma Water Resources Board , located across the street from the Murrah building . 
she played a tape of a routine board meeting on the day of the bombing . 
after two minutes of voices , the tape plays a huge roar , crashes and the frightened shout of &quot; Let &apos;s get out of here . 
other victims of the bombing -- the worst civilian attack on U.S. soil -- then took the stand to tell their stories . 
the courtroom became charged again when Lori Fortier , wife of former McVeigh friend Michael Fortier , testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution and told how McVeigh wanted to avenge the deaths of some 80 members of the Branch Davidian cult in a showdown with the government on April 19 , 1993 . 
&quot; They have terrific motive evidence -- an overpowering hatred of the government , &quot; Pizzi said . 
it is very important for jurors to see and understand the motive for a defendant &apos;s behaviour because it gives credence to the evidence , he said . 
the most dramatic testimony to date came from McVeigh &apos;s sister Jennifer , who testified that her brother wrote her in the weeks before the bombing that &quot; something big is going to happen &quot; and that she burned that letter on his instructions . 
her testimony was followed by the dull -- dozens of telephone company executives who introduced records of calls the government claims McVeigh made while planning the bombing .
