the European Court of Justice reaffirmed that Community law requires individuals to recieve prior authorization from national authorities before discharging cadmium into aquatic environments . 
an Italian court prosecuting an individual for discharging cadmium into surface waters without prior authorization asked the European court if national law might be suspended so that Community law might be applied . 
Italy had not not fully transposed Community law into natonal law when it initiated criminal proceedings against Luciano Arcaro . 
the court said that because Italy had not transposed the Community law , it could not use it against Arcaro . 
( Court translation into English . 
original language of the case : Italian ) 
&quot; Cadmium discharges - Interpretation of Council directives 76 / 464 / EEC and 83 / 513 / EEC - Direct effect - possibility for a directive to be relied on an against an individual &quot; 
in Case C-168 / 95 
reference from the Pretura Circondariale di Vicenza ( Italy ) for a preliminary ruling in the criminal proceedings before that court against 
Luciano Arcara 
Article 3 of Council directive 76 / 464 / EEC of 4 May 1976 on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community is to be interpreted as making any discharge of cadmium , irrespective of the date on which the plant from which it comes commenced operation , subject to the issue of a prior authorization . 
in the absence of full transposition by a member state within the time allowed of directive 76 / 464 , and therefore of article 3 therof , and of Council directive 84 / 513 / EEC of 26 September 1983 on limit values and quality objectives for cadmium discharges , a public authority of that state may not rely on that artice 3 against an individual . 
there is no method of procedure in Community law allowing the national court to eliminate national provisions contrary to a provision of a directive which has not been transposed where that provision may not be relied upon before the national court .
