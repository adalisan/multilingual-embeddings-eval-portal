Middle East very large crude carriers stayed firm on Wednesday , while the Mediterranean and north European markets were also fairly active , brokers said . 
&quot; Things are getting better ... There is tightness to the end of the month , &quot; one broker said . 
VLCC rates to Japan and South Korea remained close to the year high of about W75 , as witnessed by the 260,000 tonne Erica which was fixed at W74.5 to South Korea for LG Caltex . 
voyages to Singapore also fetched above W70 , with the 245,000 tonne Symi done at W71 for SPC .

Gulf VLCCs were buoyant , with the 280,000 tonne Berge Nisa said fixed at W66.5 for Arcadia and the 260,000 tonne Andros Chryssi at W67.5 for Alpine . 
in the Med , brokers said the Aframax ( 80,000 tonne ) market was quite busy although rates remained flat at W105-107.5. 
&quot; It has been fairly active on Aframaxes but not enough to push rates up , &quot; an Italian broker said . 
a few private million-barrel ( Suezmax ) deals were reported done but again rates were unchanged at W95 . 
in northern Europe , a few Aframaxes were said to have moved out of the market , but rates remained at W90-95 . 
one broker said charterers were putting stems together to load onto Suezmaxes , which could put pressure on Aframaxes in the next few days . 
in the Caribbean , 70,000 tonne crude cargoes dipped to W200 / 205 from W210 . 
&quot; There isn &apos;t the level of enquiry to keep the market up . 
there are two or three Aframaxes competing for a cargo , so rates are declining , &quot; a U.S. broker said . 
fuel oil 50,000 tonne cargoes were steady at W200 . 
in the U.K. / CONT sector , 25,000 tonne fuel oil cargoes edged down to W235 from W245 while rates in the Med were steady at W190.--London newsroom + 44 171 542 4088
