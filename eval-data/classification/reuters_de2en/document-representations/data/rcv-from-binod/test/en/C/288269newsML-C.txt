the chief executive of Chevron Nigeria Ltd , a joint venture with Chevron Corp , said on Monday his company &apos;s crude oil production averaged 401,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) in 1996 compared to 384,000 bpd in 1995 . 
&quot; In spite of the difficulties in the business environment , we were able to raise our average 1995 production from 384,000 bpd to a 1996 average of 410,000 bpd , achieving a daily increase of 17,000 bpd , &quot; George Kirkland said in an end of year message to Chevron staff in Nigeria . 
he said 1996 was a good year in the company &apos;s core business area of exploration and production . 
Nigeria &apos;s military government last year cut by 30 percent its initial budget provision of $ 2 billion for oil companies involved in joint ventures with state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp ( NNPC ) . 
Chevron is one of the six multinational oil firms in joint venture partnership with NNPC . 
Kirkland said the 1996 reserves increased significantly , adding that work was progressing on the development of four new fields in the midwest of Nigeria , while two new fields had been been discovered in the eastern operations . 
installation of facilities at the site of the Escravos gas project in the midwest was nearing completion , Kirkland said . 
&quot; Overall , we expect the Escravos Gas Project will start-up in May 1997 . 
the Escravos gas project involves the gathering and processing of gas now being flared in the NNPC / Chevron offshore Okan and Mefa fields in the Escravos area . 
the first phase of the project estimated to cost $ 569 million involves the processing of about 150 million cubic feet of associated gas per day . 
about 96 percent of associated gas produced by the NNPC-Chevron operation is currently flared . 
Kirkland said the gas project , new oil field development projects and other existing operations would be the company &apos;s key areas of focus for this year . 
&quot; We have met with our joint venture partner , NNPC , to discuss the programmes and challenges of 1997 . 
our plans are to continue to grow the company and to increase production to 600,000 bpd by the turn of this century , &quot; he said .
