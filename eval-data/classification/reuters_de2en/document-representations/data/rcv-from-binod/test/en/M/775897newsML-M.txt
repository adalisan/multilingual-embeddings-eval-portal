U.S. blue chips bounced off their lows but remained unable to press into the plus column in afternoon activity on Monday . 
the Dow industrials stood at 8172 , off 22 points for the day . 
analysts said that despite two straight jittery sessions , the Dow was not displaying signs that a serious downturn was at hand . 
&quot; This has a temporary look to it , &quot; said Greg NIE , technical analyst at EVEREN Securities . 
&quot; The volume levels support that , because we had contracting volume early Friday and noticeably contracting volume today . 
declining issues held to a slender 15-13 lead on the NYSE , where volume totalled about 340 million shares . 
a strong performance by chip stocks helped hold the Nasdaq composite seven points higher at 1602 . 
Intel Corp continued to lead the way , gaining 2-5 / 8 to 96-3 / 8 .
