White sugar futures drifted back towards earlier highs on Wednesday as trade players covered short positions , buying back hedges after the weekly European Union ( EU ) tender for export licences . 
some houses formulated their tender bids on the basis of Tuesday &apos;s firm futures close , but a lack of follow through buying after Tuesday &apos;s fund-led rally meant pre-tender hedging orders reached an unreceptive market . 
this week &apos;s restitution level was lower than expected , trade sources said . 
&quot; Now it &apos;s short-covering mixed in with a bit of buying against New York -- not necessarily premiums but the fact that New York is strong , &quot; he said . 
the EU awarded 87,750 tonnes of current series white sugar at a maximum export rebate of 41.653 Ecus per 100 kilos , after 64,275 tonnes and 42.874 Ecus last week . 
at 1600 GMT August was down $ 2.10 at $ 328.7 but still close to its intraday high of $ 329.00 . 
October was down $ 2.00 at $ 319.70 and volume was a hefty 3,200 lots . 
market sources noted some fund interest along with the trade , albeit less than earlier in the week when fund buyers piled into the August contract . 
light fund buying was also noted in October , they said . 
although some crossed trades were seen , against actuals were few and market turnover was predominantly outright , traders said . 
August / October narrowed slightly . 
the Paris market , which was hit by a similar trading scenario in the morning , was confined to 628 lots of the August contract . 
the position was down $ 1.10 at $ 328.50 .
