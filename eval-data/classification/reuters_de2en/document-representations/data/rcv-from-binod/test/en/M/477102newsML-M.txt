a political crisis ripped through Indian stocks on Monday , tearing more than eight percent off Bombay &apos;s benchmark index as investors watched the government struggle to face a challenge from a former ally , analysts said . 
&quot; It &apos;s certainly an unpalatable turn of events , &quot; said Bharat Iyer , strategist at UBS Securities . 
&quot; It &apos;s very confusing . 
share prices went into a tailspin on Sunday &apos;s news that the the Congress party had withdrawn its make-or-break support to Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda &apos;s 10- month-old government . 
Bombay &apos;s benchmark stocks index skidded 299.63 points , or 8.2 percent , to 3363.90 -- its fourth largest fall ever . 
stocks in Delhi and Calcutta fell more than six percent . 
on the Bombay-based National Stock Exchange , the index dived 89.55 points , or 8.5 percent , to a provisional close of 968.25 . 
&quot; Every time a politician says something in the coming weeks , the market will move sharply , &quot; Iyer said . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be a traders nightmare . 
analysts said they were advising institutional investors to keep a low profile until the political picture cleared . 
&quot; We &apos;re telling investors to wait-and-watch rather than sell right into the panic , &quot; said Bidisha Ganguly , economist at W.I. 
Carr Securities . 
&quot; We believe that in the short term investors shouldn &apos;t sell into the vacuum . 
they should look for a buying opportunity at around 3100 points , &quot; said Robert Jackson , chief dealer at Jardine Fleming India Broking . 
analysts said it was unclear how Congress , which has only 140 deputies in the 545-seat Lok Sabha , or lower house , could form a government . 
&quot; Everyone &apos;s confused about what Congress gets out of this move , &quot; said Keshav Sanghi , salesman at James Capel B &amp; K in Hong Kong . 
&quot; Investors are fed up . 
analysts said the surprise move -- which came just days after the government raised international equity of more than $ 500 million in telecommunications firm Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( VSNL ) -- would hit plans to sell equity in other state-run firms . 
analysts said the Congress decision was bound to affect budget proposals , announced by the United Front last month . 
in the annual budget for 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) , Finance Minister P. Chidambaram announced sweeping cuts in corporate and personal taxes . 
the proposals are scheduled to be passed by parliament once it reconvenes on April 21 . 
&quot; One big question mark now is the budget , &quot; said W.I. 
Carr &apos;s Ganguly . 
some analysts said Chidambaram &apos;s Tamil Maanila Congress would probably support the Congress in its bid for power only if there were no significant changes in the budget proposals . 
&quot; We don &apos;t think the Congress , if it comes to power , will change the budget significantly , &quot; said a chief dealer at a foreign brokerage .
