a U.S. peace mediator struggled to end an impasse over an Israel-PLO deal on Hebron on Thursday as two bombs that Israeli police blamed on Arab guerrillas wounded 13 people in Tel Aviv . 
Palestinians turned down a U.S. compromise date for Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank , insisting Washington make Israel respect the original timetable . 
while U.S. envoy Dennis Ross met again with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , two explosions rocked an area near Tel Aviv &apos;s central bus station . 
police said the bombs , placed in trash bins , were packed with nails and timed to explode 10 minutes and several metres ( yards ) apart . 
but David Bar-Illan , communications director for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , said it was too early to say if the explosions would affect the U.S.-brokered talks with the PLO . 
&quot; I am sure the prime minister is receiving detailed reports from people in the field and from security officials and then we will reach the necessary conclusions , &quot; Bar-Illan told Israeli Army Radio . 
Ross is trying to close a long-delayed deal on an Israeli withdrawal in Hebron . 
but Arafat , suspicious of Netanyahu &apos;s commitment to wider Palestinian self-rule , has been holding out for guaranteed dates for three further pullbacks in the rest of the West Bank . 
&quot; Israel has proposed to end the last stage of further redeployments from the rest of the West Bank in 1999 . 
we rejected that , &quot; said Tayeb Abdel-Rahim , general secretary of the Palestinian presidency . 
&quot; So to break the deadlock in the talks Ross proposed as a compromise mid-1998 , and we rejected this as well , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; The Palestinian leadership will not make and cannot make any more compromises , especially on dates stated in the original agreement and the U.S. compromise is a violation of the deal that was signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton , &quot; Abdel-Rahim said . 
Western diplomats said talks on extending Palestinian self-rule appeared bogged down . 
&quot; Both sides are now playing the blame game . 
there &apos;s not much more Ross can do for the moment , &quot; said one diplomat . 
Ross has been shuttling for weeks between Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
publicly , U.S. officials said Ross had no plans to return home but in private one official said he could leave on Friday if a meeting with Netanyahu late on Thursday drew a blank . 
Arafat was also waiting for the outcome of Ross &apos;s meeting to determine whether he should leave for a scheduled European trip on Friday , PLO officials said . 
Netanyahu and Arafat accuse each other of delaying the talks . 
negotiators say a deal on Hebron is all but reached . 
the argument now is over the timing and scope of three further redeployments which should be completed by September 7 this year under the Oslo peace accords . 
Netanyahu , facing a revolt by as many as seven of his 18 cabinet ministers if he hands back Hebron , wants to extend redeployment into 1999 , partly to strengthen his hand in talks on a final settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Arafat wants to be in control of the 90 percent of the West Bank he believes should be his under Oslo before negotiating such sensitive &quot; final status &quot; issues as Jerusalem , refugees and the powers of a Palestinian government . 
Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said Ross held a &quot; very positive &quot; meeting with Arafat &apos;s senior aide Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday . 
&quot; Mr Ross will continue efforts with President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu in the hope that the gaps will be bridged , &quot; Erekat told reporters .
