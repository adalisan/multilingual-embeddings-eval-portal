French voters will open a third period of awkward power-sharing if they elect a Socialist-led government on Sunday to &quot; cohabit &quot; with conservative President Jacques Chirac . 
the late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand shared power with hostile centre-right governments from 1986 to 1988 and 1993 to 1995 . 
Chirac , elected for a seven-year term in 1995 , has said he will not resign if he has to cohabit with Socialist leader Lionel Jospin as prime minister after Sunday &apos;s decisive second round in the National Assembly election . 
the following are the mechanics of cohabitation under the 1958 constitution , which gives the executive strong powers while poorly defining the limits of the president &apos;s and the government &apos;s responsibilities . 
the president appoints the prime minister , and names cabinet ministers on the premier &apos;s recommendation . 
the president chairs all cabinet meetings . 
a new government does not require a parliamentary vote of confidence . 
in 1986 , Mitterrand rejected nominees for both foreign affairs and defence proposed by Chirac , who was prime minister . 
Chirac backed down and named new ministers . 
the president guarantees French independence and respect of international treaties , leading Mitterrand to claim pre-eminence in foreign affairs . 
Article 20 also gives the government a broad mandate , saying : &quot; the government determines and carries out the nation &apos;s policy &quot; . 
the president is the head of France &apos;s armed forces , and commander of the nuclear arsenal . 
the prime minister is &quot; responsible for national defence &quot; , and declarations of war are approved by parliament . 
Parliament passes laws , including the budget , presented by the government . 
the president has no veto but can ask parliament to reconsider laws he is asked to promulgate . 
Article 13 says the president &quot; signs decrees and orders approved by the cabinet &quot; . 
in July 1986 , Mitterrand refused to sign decrees speeding up privatisation of state firms and making it easier to lay off workers . 
Chirac had then to resort to a more cumbersome legislative route . 
a prime minister can rule with a minority because the constitution does not require a government to resign if it is defeated in parliament on ordinary legislation . 
Article 49-3 gives a minority government leverage to push through legislation by linking bills it considers vital to an overall confidence vote . 
if the article is invoked , the opposition must either accept the bill or call a no-confidence motion within 24 hours . 
if passed , the motion topples the government . 
former Socialist prime minister Michel Rocard invoked Article 49-3 several times to pass legislation from 1988 to 1991 . 
the Communists did not vote with the right-wing opposition to oust his minority government because they feared a new election . 
the president can take undefined &quot; measures demanded by circumstances &quot; if institutions , national independence or France &apos;s ability to meet international commitments are threatened in a &quot; serious and immediate way &quot; . 
the president can call referendums . 
the president can dissolve parliament and call a snap parliamentary election , but cannot do so twice within a year .
