U.S. stocks , unable to crack key barriers on major indexes , appear poised for a pullback most likely starting in July , technical analysts said on Thursday . 
the Dow Jones Industrial average has repeatedly backed off the 7800 level , while the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 has been unable to hold above 900 . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s an excellent sign of a tired market , &quot; said Alan Newman , technical analyst at H.D. 
Brous &amp; Co . &quot; It been one heck of a run and the market &apos;s just saying , &apos; it &apos;s enough already , we need to retrace a little bit . 
in Thursday afternoon trading the Dow was off about 41 points at 7648 , demonstrating the volatility that has begun to characterize Wall Street trading in recent sessions . 
the most recent attempts to penetrate the 7800 level on the Dow and the 900 mark on the S &amp; P 500 came on Wednesday . 
the Dow hit a session high of 7812 before sliding to close at 7690 . 
the Dow closed at a record high last Friday at 7796.51 , a rise of over 1400 points from its 1997 low on April 11 . 
after the sharp runup , the increased volatility in stocks and the failure to break through at key levels are signs stocks are ready to pause , analysts said . 
but buying by portfolio managers at the end of the quarter could give stocks some support through the end of June , they said . 
however , July will bring several hurdles , the first of which will be the meeting of the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-making market committee next Tuesday and Wednesday . 
while most of Wall Street expects the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged , the FOMC meeting will be followed by the flood of second quarter earnings reports . 
&quot; earnings probably are going to meet expectations , &quot; said Ricky Harrington , techical analyst at Interstate / Johnson Lane . 
&quot; They may be a positive early in July , but once you get past the earnings season there may not be anything that can prevent the market from having a correction . 
Newman said he expected a correction of between four and five percent for July . 
a five percent correction would pull the Dow to about 7400 from its all-time closing high . 
Joseph Barthel , director of investment strategy at Fahnestock , said in a report that as the Dow encounters resistance near 7900 , a correction lasting two to three weeks and bringing the average back to 7500-7600 &quot; is likely to develop . 
Barthel said , however , longer term he expected the Dow to move toward 8300 . 
Harrington said the market would benefit from a period of low volume and low volatility . 
if high volatility continues &quot; it indicates a lot of uncertainty and a lot of uneasy money that could cause the market to react to any kind of outside influence , &quot; he said .
