wholesale gasoline prices in California tumbled 7.8 percent Wednesday , reflecting a decline in energy futures prices and the absense of possible supply disruptions . 
by early afternoon , traders said the price of California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) gasoline dropped to 76 cents a gallon , down six cents from Tuesday and 10.50 cents from a week ago . 
traders attributed the sudden drop to weaker gasoline futures prices and stronger market fundamentals . 
&quot; The Merc &apos;s down and all the refineries are running , so there &apos;s going to be more gas over the next month , &quot; said a West Coast broker , referring to gasoline futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange . 
the unleaded futures contract for May delivery fell 2.06 cents , or 3.3 percent , Wednesday to close at 60.61 cents a gallon . 
traders said spot prices lost support over the weekend when Tosco Corp and its refinery workers in California averted a strike by agreeing to a new five-year Labor contract . 
the week before union workers had threatened to walk out because of disagreements over job cuts and benefits , setting the stage for the disruption of 250,000 barrels-per-day of production capacity at four plants in California . 
other refineries in the region also maintained stable output . 
refinery utilization , a measure of plant productivity , remained steady on the West Coast last week at 89.8 percent , according to the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) , a Washington D.C.-based industry group . 
steady production followed the return of Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp &apos;s California refineries in late March after two-month maintenance shutdowns . 
the plants have a combined crude distillation capacity of 265,000 barrels per day . 
the increased output was reflected in Tueday &apos;s API inventory report , which showed gasoline supplies in the region rose by 98,000 barrels last week .
