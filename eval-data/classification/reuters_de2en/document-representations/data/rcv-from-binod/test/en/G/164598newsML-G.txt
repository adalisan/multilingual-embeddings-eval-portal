Palestinians approve of Jordan &apos;s custodianship over Arab East Jerusalem &apos;s Moslem sites until the status of the city is resolved in final status talks with Israel , a senior Palestinian official said on Monday . 
&quot; We are keen on the Jordanian role and the Jordanian custodianship of the holy sites and Islamic endowments in Jerusalem , &quot; Tayeb Abdul-Rahim , an aide to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , was quoted by Jordan &apos;s Petra news agency as saying after meeting Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti . 
Abdul-Rahim led a delegation of senior Palestinians who held talks with Jordanian officials on Sunday . 
Palestinians said they were the first official talks to coordinate efforts to preserve Moslem holy sites in Arab East Jerusalem from Israeli designs . 
&quot; This concern stems from the national and Islamic stance during the whole of the interim phase until the resolving of the issue of Jerusalem in the final status talks , &quot; he said . 
talks on the future of East Jerusalem , captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , have been put aside until final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians . 
the final status talks were due to start in May but were frozen after the May election of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who vowed not to make any concessions on Jerusalem or on captured Arab land . 
Jordan &apos;s King Hussein has played a custodianship role over the Moslem holy sites , based on his Hashemite family links to the prophet Mohammed and Jordan &apos;s rule over the West Bank and East Jerusalem from 1950 to 1967 . 
Jordan still provides financial support to maintain al-Aqsa Mosque complex -- the third holiest Moslem shrine -- and pays the salaries of Palestinian employees working there . 
King Hussein &apos;s &quot; special role &quot; over the sites , recognised in Jordan &apos;s 1994 peace treaty , raised suspicions among Palestinians . 
but worries that Netanyahu &apos;s policies endanger the future of the Middle East peace process are drawing the PLO and Jordan closer . 
King Hussein was personally angered by Israel &apos;s move last September to open a tunnel beside the al-Aqsa Mosque which he considered a violation of the 1994 Jordan-Israel treaty .
