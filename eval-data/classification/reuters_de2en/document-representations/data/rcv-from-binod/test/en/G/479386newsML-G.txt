four members of France &apos;s far-right National Front who pretended to be policemen and &quot; arrested &quot; two anti-Front protesters were each sentenced on Tuesday to one-year suspended prison terms . 
they were also stripped of their right to vote or to stand for office for two years . 
the state prosecutor had asked a court that the rightists be jailed for six months with another six months &apos; jail suspended . 
the four , an elected regional councillor and three members of the Front &apos;s security service , stopped and searched two youths seeking accommodation on Sunday in a hotel where Front delegates were staying in the eastern town of Strasbourg . 
the youths were among some 40,000 protesters who took part in a march against a congress held in the town by Jean-Marie Le Pen &apos;s National Front . 
the charge of &quot; making illegal arrests and wrongfully assuming the functions of officers in the criminal police &quot; made the accused liable to up to five years in prison . 
the court earlier sentenced 13 young people to terms ranging from a suspended month in jail to eight months in prison for rioting during the weekend protest against the National Front . 
fifteen young people were on trial , accused of stoning police or looting shops . 
two Germans among them were granted a request to be given time to prepare their defence . 
they will remain in detention and be tried on April 17 . 
all those sentenced were French . 
the state prosecutor told the court the main troublemakers had escaped arrest . 
trouble broke out after the march went off peacefully . 
rioters clashed with police as they tried to march towards the conference centre and later smashed some 20 shop windows . 
the three-day congress ended on Monday .
