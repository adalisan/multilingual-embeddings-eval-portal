many other men might have buckled under the strain Frank Williams has faced in recent weeks . 
not him . 
the son of a pilot in the British air force , Williams has proved over and again that he is a gritty character . 
guts and courage are among his favourite qualities in Grand Prix drivers . 
they are also among his clearest characteristics and that has never been demonstrated more obviously than by his recovery from the terrible accident in 1986 which has left him in a wheelchair . 
but he has fought to realise a dream . 
he wanted to run his own successful Formula One motor racing team , and he is clearly not going to allow anything to obstruct him now that he has achieved that aim . 
next month , he goes to a court at Imola , Italy , to face manslaughter charges in connection with the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola in 1994 . 
he is also locked in a contractual dispute with his chief designer Adrian Newey , which has deprived him of his services this winter , and remains a non-signatory to the Concorde Agreement which embodies the constitution and administration of Formula One . 
and he faces the onset of all the pressures which come with a new Formula One season -- the 1997 championship begins in Melbourne on March 9 . 
yet at his team &apos;s former headquarters at Didcot on Friday , at the official launch of Williams &apos; 1997 defence of their two world titles , Williams grinned and joked as if he had hardly a care in the world . 
asked if he was worried by the distraction that the Imola trial would have on him and his team , he said : &quot; It will have no effect at all on myself , on Patrick Head or anyone else involved in the team or in our approach to the season . 
we will be racing -- it will be business as usual . 
typical Williams , pithy and direct . 
Imola holds no fears for him . 
nor does the prospect of the 1997 season . 
&quot; It is not how good it is or isn &apos;t . 
it is how good the other teams are , how much they have improved , which worries me . 
but Williams has been invigorated by good news . 
when his team &apos;s supply of Renault V10 engines ends this year -- Renault are hoping to secure a sixth successive share in the constructors &apos; title -- they will continue with Renault engines in another guise , that of Mecachrome , the Bourges-based engine-tuning company who have been Renault &apos;s partners for 20 years . 
for Williams , it is both good and bad . 
he knows that Williams will have state-of-the-art power units . 
but he knows , also , that for the first time since 1988 , he will have to pay for them . 
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That &apos;s painful . 
but we have always been very impressed with Renault and their ability to make progress , as they have with the new RS9 . 
so it is a reliable product ... But I hope we will not have to pay for our engines forever . 
in his early years , Williams experienced such financial hardships he was forced him to sleep on a settee and had his telephone cut off . 
now he has a successful company employing more than 240 people at new state-of-the-art headquarters at Grove in Oxfordshire . 
a complex , determined man of great integrity , he also has room in his life for charity . 
when his team &apos;s new base was opened officially by Princess Anne last October , a formal lunch and ceremony was held during which Williams raised more than 30,000 dollars for the team &apos;s official charity -- the spinal injuries Association . 
that small deed , as much as the pomp and ceremony of his team &apos;s new car launch , helps explain the character of Frank Williams and his fortitude -- and why he is coolness personified at the eye of a storm .
