China on Monday renewed demands to see confidential files on senior officials in Hong Kong &apos;s colonial administration but Britain , whose continued refusal to hand over the files has upset Beijing , again said no . 
&quot; We always considered that there is a practical need for the Hong Kong government to hand over the archives on senior officials to the Chinese side , &quot; Wang Weiyang , China &apos;s delegate to Joint Liaison Group ( JLG ) talks , told reporters . 
but the British representative to the JLG , the body set up by Britain and China to hash out differences arising from the transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty , said the matter was none of Beijing &apos;s business . 
he said it was for Hong Kong &apos;s current and future governments to handle . 
&quot; This is not a matter which is under discussion at the moment in the JLG , &quot; said Alan Paul . 
&quot; It is a matter , in our view , which can and should be resolved between the Hong Kong government and the Chief Executive . 
the Chief Executive is Tung Chee-hwa , the Hong Kong shipping tycoon who will take over from British colonial Governor Chris Patten at midnight on June 30 . 
Tung has not yet announced which of the government &apos;s policy secretaries will stay on after the handover . 
only Chief Secretary Anson Chan , Patten &apos;s deputy , has so far been asked to stay . 
the colonial administration has always refused to reveal the contents of civil service personnel files to Beijing , especially information it may have on what passports officials hold . 
top officials won &apos;t be allowed to hold foreign passports after the handover . 
Monday &apos;s talks focused not on personnel files , however , but on Hong Kong &apos;s foreign affairs archives . 
Wang said Britain should hand over everything . 
Paul said the Chinese side revealed for the first time on Monday specific details of the sort of material it wanted . 
&quot; We &apos;ve already pasesd to them a lot of material on foreign affairs , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In our view ... we think we &apos;ve given them all they should need , but they &apos;ve come up this morning with new requests which we will need time to consider .
