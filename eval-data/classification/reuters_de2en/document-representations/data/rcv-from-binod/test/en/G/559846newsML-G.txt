police on Monday shot one of two Republic of Texas separatists who fled into the west Texas mountains as the ragtag militia ended its week-long standoff with police , a police spokesman said . 
&quot; At 2 : 03 p.m. ( CDT ) , we had a report that one of the hostiles was down and not moving , &quot; Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike Cox told reporters . 
police with bloodhounds were tracking the men through rugged terrain in the Davis Mountains and were uncertain whether the man who was shot was injured or killed , Cox said . 
two men identified as Richard Keyes and Mike Matson , dressed in camouflage and armed with an assault rifle , a deer-hunting rifle and a .9mm pistol , walked out of the Republic of Texas compound on Saturday , hours before the group surrendered to police . 
Keyes is wanted on state kidnapping charges and Matson is wanted for questioning , Cox said . 
earlier in the day , five shots were fired and one police bloodhound was injured about an hour after the dogs began tracking the men through rugged terrain surrounding the group &apos;s compound .
