German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Wednesday that Turkey &apos;s ambitions to join the European Union would not be rejected but that Ankara will have to wait for EU membership . 
&quot; Turkey belongs to Europe . 
the Turkish train remains on the main track , it will not be put on the side track , &quot; Kinkel told a news conference in the Turkish capital . 
he said Ankara had a host of problems to sort out before being accepted into the European club . 
&quot; Turkey will not be able to become a member of the European Union in the near term ... because of human rights , the Kurdish question , relations with Greece and certain economic matters , &quot; he said . 
leading European Christian Democrats , angered by the Turkish threat , said at a meeting earlier this month that Turkey was unfit to join the EU , partly because of its Moslem culture . 
Kinkel earlier traded harsh words with Turkey &apos;s Islamist prime minister , Necmettin Erbakan , over Ankara &apos;s complaints that it has lost out in a trade pact with Europe . 
Kinkel was close to calling off his visit at the last minute because of media reports quoting Erbakan as saying he should come to Turkey with his head bowed . 
&quot; No European will have to bow their head to Turkey in shame , &quot; Kinkel told German reporters on the first day of an official visit to Turkey . 
Erbakan told MPs of his Welfare Party on Tuesday that Turkey should be treated with more respect internationally . 
he blamed Europe for what he said were losses because of a customs accord with the EU that went into effect at the start of 1996 . 
&quot; There will be a $ 5 billion loss for Turkey because it has entered the customs union ... After they have done this they will bow their heads when they talk with Turkey , &quot; Erbakan said . 
EU exports to Turkey have surged under the accord , while Turkish exports to the bloc have changed little . 
Erbakan has promised a more independent foreign policy since he came to power last June . 
millions of dollars in EU aid to Ankara under the customs union have been blocked by Turkey &apos;s traditional foe Greece over disputes in Cyprus and the Aegean and by EU states concerned about Turkey &apos;s human rights record . 
&quot; It is centrally important that there is movement and improvement in the Turkey-Greece relationship , &quot; Kinkel told the news conference . 
Turkey has been an associate member of the EU since 1963 and regards it as unjust that other states , including former east European adversaries , are likely to get into the EU before it .
