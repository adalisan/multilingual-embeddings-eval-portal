the government of Cameroon said on Thursday it had signed a letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund which should lead to a speedy disbursement of funds by various donors . 
&quot; The signing of this letter of intent is a new lease to economic recovery to our country , &quot; Prime Minister Peter Mafany Musonge said . 
certain conditions still have to be met by the government , but a full , three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility should be agreed by the IMF , perhaps as early as next month , donor sources said .
