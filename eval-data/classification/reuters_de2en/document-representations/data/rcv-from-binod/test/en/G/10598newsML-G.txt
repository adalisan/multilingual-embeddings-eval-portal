more than 20 people were injured , some seriously , in an accident which halted the opening phase of the 1,000 Lakes Rally in Jyvaskyla , central Finland , on Friday . 
initial reports spoke of 29 injured , and the Finnish STT news agency said at least 10 people had been hurt . 
the accident happened during a two-km time trial at the event , the sixth round of the world championship , when Danish driver Karsten Richardt skidded down an escape road in his Mitsubishi and went into a crowd of spectators . 
STT said Karsten and his co-driver Ole Frederiksen crashed into the crowd which was standing in a cordoned-off area for spectators . 
Finnish television said at least one of the injuries was serious , but the STT news agency said no one had been killed according to initial reports . 
the time trial was suspended as dusk approached because most of the remaining cars did not have auxiliary lights fitted . 
they were therefore given the time of the fastest runner before the stage was stopped , and overnight 60 cars are classified as tied for the lead . 
the rally is to resume on Saturday .
