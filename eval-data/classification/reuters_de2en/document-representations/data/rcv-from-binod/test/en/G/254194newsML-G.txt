Robert Louis-Dreyfus officially became the new chairman of Marseille on Friday , two days before their high profile French first division clash with champions Auxerre at the velodrome . 
caretaker chairman Jean-Clause Gaudin stepped down as the Mediterranean port city club changed its statutes and became a limited company with 29.48 million francs ( $ 5.9 million ) in capital . 
&quot; It is with much fear and hope that I assume this position : fear that I might not make the om ( Olympique Marseille ) a great club ; hope that I can lead them towards the European summits , &quot; said Louis-Dreyfus , also head of the sportswear giant Adidas . 
Marseille has passed back to private investors from control by the municipality and local councils which took over after the fall of controversial previous owner Bernard Tapie which began with the 1993 match-rigging scandal . 
a company called Eric soccer created jointly by Louis-Dreyfus and Swiss holtelier Reto stiffer owns 54 percent of the shares after buying them for 20 million francs ( $ 4 million ) from the Marseille city authorities . 
Louis-Dreyfus said Marseille &apos;s first goal was to &quot; get a place in Europe , from this year ( season ) if possible . 
he also wants Marseille to set up the means of exploiting the market in products related to football . 
but he warned : &quot; When you think that PSG ( Paris St-Germain ) , France &apos;s leading club , is only the 140th club in Europe in this area , you realise how far we have to go . 
Louis-Dreyfus said Marseille were looking on two fronts for a forward to strengthen the team &apos;s attack , &quot; one in Germany , the other in Valencia &quot; . 
Marseille , 13th in the first division with 19 goals in 21 matches , have been linked with Spanish first division Valencia &apos;s Croatian striker Goran Vlaovic .
