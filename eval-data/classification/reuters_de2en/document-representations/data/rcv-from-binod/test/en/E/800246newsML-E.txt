the Bank of England has used its new-found freedom wisely , most market experts say , and they welcome the new era of openness in explaining policy decisions . 
but trying to talk the pound down could end in tears , they said on Thursday , and the Bank still has a long way to go to emulate the doyen of central banks -- the U.S. Federal Reserve . 
the Bank had its day in the sun on Wednesday when it unveiled its quarterly inflation report before the television cameras for the first time . 
Bank chief economist Mervyn King said after four interest rate rises in as many months -- since Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown granted it freedom to set monetary policy -- there would be a pause to take stock . 
he added that rates could now be high enough for the government &apos;s 2.5 percent target for underlying inflation to be met in two years time and said the Bank is working on the assumption that the pound will fall from its heady heights . 
&quot; In the past , the Bank has quite rightly been criticised for couching their language in very coded terms . 
that seems to have changed , &quot; said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC . 
&quot; They seem to be more up front now and and I think it &apos;s in their interests to be so . 
they face a big policy dilemma , &quot; he said . 
that dilemma is posed by rocketing high street demand in stark contrast to Britain &apos;s manufacturers who are having a lean time , their export markets squeezed by the meteoric rise of the pound -- up almost 25 percent in a year . 
higher rates may take the heat out of the high street but will squeeze exporters harder too . 
and with control of interest rates , the Bank faces the public &apos;s wrath if it gets it wrong . 
but over the past week , the Bank appears to have performed a neat trick by calling a halt to the recent spate of rate rises . 
Wednesday &apos;s inflation report banged that message home , helping the pound topple from a high of 3.06 deutschemarks last week to 2.90 . 
&quot; They &apos;ve finally addressed the dilemma . 
King said they weren &apos;t talking currency down but he was being a little disingenuous , &quot; Coleman said . 
in its report , the Bank said it assumed the pound &apos;s trade-weighted index will fall to 90 in two years time , from above 100 now . 
the strength of the pound may be checking export growth but if it tumbles dramatically , even this lagging sector will catch up with the strong pace seen everywhere else in the economy . 
&quot; In that case , the economy will barrel along into 1998 and base rates will have to go even higher . 
are they talking sterling down in order to raise rates even more than people expect ? 
that the Bank will have to justify itself in the public arena is also a mixed blessing , Bloom said . 
&quot; It seems from now on it will always say policy is right to hit the inflation target . 
otherwise , it is admitting it has got it wrong . 
the latest inflation quarterly certainly seemed to focus heavily on the risks to inflation -- wage growth , consumer demand , building society windfalls -- while saying the target will be met . 
&quot; It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that they are painting a picture of an economy growing quite fast , &quot; said Ian Stewart , UK economist at Merrill Lynch . 
&quot; The implication is that they will return to tightening later this year . 
of course , the jury remains out on whether the inflation target will be met . 
until then , the only fair yardstick to measure the Bank against is that of its big brothers , the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank . 
both Coleman and Bloom said Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was unassailable as the number one central bank governor , having delivered seven years of steady growth with low inflation . 
but the German central bank has little to shout about despite its cast-iron credentials for control of inflation . 
&quot; The great difference between the Bundesbank and the BoE is that the Bundesbank speaks with about 12 different voices . 
reputation or not , I think that is extremely damaging , &quot; Coleman said . 
many of the 12 Bundesbank council members have become increasingly vocal with their views in recent months . 
&quot; We have seen council members giving completely different interpretations of policy in public , &quot; Coleman said . 
of course , there may come a time when the Bank &apos;s nine-person monetary policy committee -- comprising five Bank members and four outsiders from academia and industry -- may disagree . 
but the presence of arch-inflation hawk Mervyn King , will be a comfort to the markets . 
as chief economist , he is in charge of the Bank &apos;s inflation report and as deputy governor-elect , he fills a key seat on the committee . 
&quot; King is becoming the power behind the throne , &quot; Coleman said . 
&quot; He is very hawkish on inflation . 
the markets will be happy about that .
