the Justice Department is considering obtaining its own grants of immunity for Buddhist temple members who may have made illegal campaign donations to the Democratic Party , the Washington Post said Thursday . 
the Justice Department task force investigating campaign finance violations in the 1996 presidential campaign has asked for a proffer -- a statement of what each would say if granted immunity from prosecution -- from 15 temple members , the paper said . 
their attorney was expected to give the department a partial rundown next Wednesday , it said , quoting Sen. Fred Thompson , a Tennessee Republican . 
Thompson said Attorney General Janet Reno briefed him and Sen. John Glenn , the Ohio Democrat who is the ranking minority member on the panel about the timetable on Wednesday evening . 
Thompson , whose Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , is also investigating the matter , will begin televised hearings July 8 . 
he has sought immunity for the 15 temple members and three others who worked for Democratic fund-raiser Charlie Trie , but has been unable to get the Democratic votes he needs for a two-thirds majority . 
the committee is probing whether Asian business interests or the Chinese government tried to influence the 1996 presidential election by illegally donating funds to the Democratic Party through Asian-American intermediaries . 
it is also investigating whether foreigners attempted to win influence or favors or gained access to classified information in return for their illegal financial support . 
most of the Buddhists wrote checks donating funds to the Democratic party in connection with a controversial April 1996 fund-raiser attended by Vice President Al Gore at the Hsi Lai Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights . 
the Justice Department has a longstanding practice of not prosecuting people who are used &quot; as conduits to disguise another person &apos;s contribution , provided that allowing their names to be used by another is the extent of their participation . 
the event at the Buddhist temple apparently violated the tax-exempt status of that religious institution . 
several Buddhist monks and nuns who had taken vows of poverty wrote checks for thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party and were reimbursed a few days later .
