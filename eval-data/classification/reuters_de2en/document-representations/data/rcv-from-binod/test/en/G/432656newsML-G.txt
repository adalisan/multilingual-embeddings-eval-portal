Ireland &apos;s Space trucker was on Tuesday expected to start favourite for the 1997 Grade One Champion hurdle at Cheltenham after two days of brilliant sunshine at Prestbury Park racecourse . 
Jim Old-trained Collier Bay was the 3-1 overnight favourite to retain his 1996 crown with Oliver Sherwood &apos;s Large Action at 7-2 and Jessica Harrington &apos;s Space trucker quoted at 4-1 . 
but with the surface sure to be sound for the 175,000 pounds sterling presentation at 1515 GMT and with many of the 10,000 Irish punters at Cheltenham expected to row in behind Space trucker , a change in the betting order is anticipated . 
&quot; I can see Space trucker start as favourite for the Champion , &quot; Irish trainer and media pundit Ted Walsh told the Morning Line programme on Channel 4 on Tuesday . 
&quot; The sound surface and the Irish interest will ensure that . 
Ireland &apos;s six other entries in the Champion hurdle are also expected to come in for support with the good ground unlikely to hinder Kevin Prendergast &apos;s I &apos;m Supposin ( 6-1 ) and Noel Meade &apos;s Irish Champion hurdle winner Cockney lad ( 25-1 ) . 
elsewhere on the six race card , Aidan O &apos;Brien-trained Finnegan &apos;s hollow is 10-3 favourite to land the Grade One Supreme novices &apos; hurdle , the opening race of the three-day Festival of Racing at 1400 GMT . 
David Nicholson &apos;s Mulligan is 5-4 favourite for the Grade One Arkle Challenge trophy Chase at 1435 GMT while Gordon Richards-trained General Command is 5-4 favourite for the National Hunt Handicap Chase at 1555 GMT .
