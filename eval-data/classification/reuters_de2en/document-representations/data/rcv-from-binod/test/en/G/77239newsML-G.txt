suspected Moslem militants shot at a convoy of boats cruising up the Nile from the southern Egyptian town of Mallawi but there were no tourists aboard , security sources said on Wednesday . 
the crews of the six ships , bound for Abu Qurqas some 230 km ( 143 miles ) south of Cairo , were unharmed but some window panes were broken , the sources said . 
they said the gunmen , thought to be members of the Gama &apos;a Al-Islamiya ( Islamic Group ) fighting to overthrow the state , sprayed the cruisers on Tuesday with machine gun fire . 
it was the first attack on a tourist ship in at least two years . 
armed Islamist groups had often targeted cruisers in their four-year-old battle against the government . 
almost 1,000 people have been killed and scores wounded in the political violence .
