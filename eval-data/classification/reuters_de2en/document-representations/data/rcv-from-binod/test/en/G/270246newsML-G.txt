Italy said on Friday that Libya had decided to release two Italian fishermen held for four months and convicted this week of violation of territorial waters . 
the gesture , announced by the Italian foreign ministry , could help in gradual dialogue which Italy has been pursuing with Libya . 
diplomatic sources said Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini had told Libyan foreign liaison minister Omar Mustafa al-Montasser at talks in Rome on Wednesday that bilateral relations could not improve as long as the case of the two men was not resolved . 
the pair , Sicilians Gennaro Grillo and Leonardo Cellura , were arrested by Libyan security forces and put on trial for alleged infringement of Libyan territorial waters , a charge they and Italy denied . 
a court in Tripoli sentenced them to six-month prison terms on Monday and ruled that the boat should be confiscated . 
the sources said al-Montasser had hinted at movement in the dispute at his talks with Dini . 
&quot; The Libyan Embassy in Rome has confirmed the announcement ... of the imminent release of two Italian citizens , Gennaro Grillo and Leonardo Cellura , &quot; a ministry statement said . 
Italy , which has strong commercial ties with Libya , wants to pursue a &quot; prudent dialogue &quot; with the North African state to encourage its leader Muammar Gaddafi to introduce democracy and disavow terrorism . 
in remarks that threw up policy differences with the United States over how to deal with Gaddafi , deputy foreign minister Piero Fassino said last month that isolation was not the most effective instrument to bring about change in Libya . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a law in August aimed at preventing new foreign investment in Libya and Iran , countries which Washington believes back terrorism . 
the United States has a long list of grievances against Libya , including its refusal to surrender two nationals accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland in 1988 , killing 270 people aboard the plane and on the ground .
