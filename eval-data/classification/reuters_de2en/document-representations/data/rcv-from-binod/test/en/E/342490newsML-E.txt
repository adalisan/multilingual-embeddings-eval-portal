economic growth figures in the Philippines in 1996 show that the country is well on its way to sustained , steady expansion , analysts said on Wednesday . 
concern , however , remains over developments on the political front as a result of the impending 1998 presidential elections , which may hold back some reforms in the economy , they said . 
the Philippines earlier reported that gross national product ( GNP ) registered a growth rate of 6.8 percent in 1996 comapred with 5.0 percent in 1995 . 
but gross domestic product growth was at 5.5 percent from 4.8 percent in 1995 , which was short of a forecast range of 6.0 to 6.8 percent for the year . 
these are sustainable growth rates . 
it &apos;s not discouraging , &quot; said Emma Pante , an economist with the Far East Bank and Trust Co . 
the second and third quarters were growing at a blistering pace , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The economy is still strong and will move up to around 6.0 percent ( GDP ) in 1997 , he said , adding that his GNP forecast is 7.0 percent for this year . 
this year , all eyes will be on the political front as potential candidates begin early early campaigning , analysts said . 
socio-economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito warned that political preoccupation could affect the country &apos;s economic agenda . 
&quot; There has always been parallelism between political stability and economic growth in the Philippines , &quot; Pante said . 
&quot; It will affect affect investment interest . 
it &apos;s going to be a concern , &quot; Cuyegkeng said . 
nevertheless , &quot; the reforms initiated since 1991 and pursued aggressively by the current administration is difficult to reverse , &quot; he said , pointing out that a growing middle-income group had benefitted from such reforms . 
since 1991 , the government implemented foreign exchange liberalisation , capital market reforms , and opened up the telecommunications and banking industries . 
far East Bank &apos;s Pante said the bigger concern was the country &apos;s low domestic savings rate of around 15 percent of GDP versus its East Asian neighbours 30 percent . 
the savings need to be raised in order to support the heavy infrastructure requirements of the country estimated at $ 50 billion up to the year 2004 , she said .
