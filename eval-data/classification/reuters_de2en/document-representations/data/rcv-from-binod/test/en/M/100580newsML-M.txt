the gold market held quiet and fairly steady around the $ 380 per ounce level on Monday afternoon but dealers said expectations were still for a fall . 
&quot; It is very dull indeed . 
there is a lot of bearish sentiment around and there may be another splash to come , &quot; one dealer said . 
gold was fixed at $ 380.10 after $ 379.60 this morning and a Friday close of $ 380.20 / $ 380.70 . 
at the fixing the COMEX December futures were $ 0.20 down at $ 382.40 after forecasts of an unchanged to $ 0.50 lower opening . 
dealers said there was very little business being done . 
technically , gold &apos;s 10-day moving average was flattening out slightly , while the 30-day indicator proceeded in a steady downward slope . 
the RSI was creeping higher at 39 , although the market was still seen quite short . 
&quot; It &apos;s still oversold and it won &apos;t be suprising if there &apos;s some sort of recovery , &quot; a European analyst said . 
&quot; But it &apos;s probably more likely to test the lower end of the range . 
a London-based dealer commented , &quot; When everybody is looking the one way it usually goes the other , so maybe you should buy . 
he added that producers could be waiting for a bounce . 
&quot; They may have held off and gearing up to sell into a rally , &quot; he said , adding that this would make a limited upside , at least in the short term . 
&quot; A lot of the shorts have got puts in place which lets them buy when they think ( the price ) is down , &quot; he said . 
but dealers and analyst were unanimous that the funds held the key to gold &apos;s next move . 
&quot; It &apos;s down to the funds unless something new comes along , &quot; one dealer said . 
lease rates were slightly easier than Friday and back around levels seen at the beginning of last week , although still well above mid-September levels . 
some dealers said most of the dynamic behind the moves in lease rates was fund short covering rather than producer or rumoured central bank selling . 
&quot; Most of the borrowing we saw recently was for a month . 
the lending that has come into the market is mainly for one or two weeks , suggesting the funds are lending back their unused cover , &quot; a dealer said . 
the other metals were very quiet . 
silver was four cents lower at $ 4.87 / $ 4.89 , platinum was 80 cents off at $ 383.10 / $ 384.10 and palladium down $ 1.00 at $ 119.00 / $ 120.00 .
