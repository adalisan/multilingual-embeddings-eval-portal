Tokyo pledged economic aid to combat poverty in Peru after the 126-day hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s home helped cement bilateral ties between the countries , Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said on Friday . 
&quot; The hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s official residence helped strengthen bilateral ties , &quot; Ikeda told Peru &apos;s Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi , according to a briefing by the Japanese foreign ministry on meetings he held on Friday in Lima . 
&quot; We will do whatever we can to help fight poverty , &quot; Ikeda was quoted as later telling Jorge Gonzales Izquierdo , who deputized for Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela during an 18-week ordeal under the gun of Tupac Amaru rebels . 
Ikeda told Gonzales Tokyo would continue to extend economic and technological assistance in its fight against poverty -- the same avowed fight the Marxist rebels claimed was at the root of their Dec . 17 hostage-taking . 
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels also said they targeted Japan due to its persistent &quot; meddling &quot; in the governing of Peru . 
Ikeda praised the Peruvian government for taking a firm stand against terrorism . 
&quot; Peru made it clear to the world that it will never give in to terrorism , &quot; Ikeda told Peruvian prime minister Pandolfi . 
in a bloody rescue operation , Peruvian troops stormed the Japanese ambassador &apos;s home on Tuesday and freed alive all but one of the 72 hostages including 24 Japanese diplomats and businessmen . 
along with one Peruvian hostage , two soldiers and all 14 MRTA rebels died in the operation . 
&quot; We regret the death of three Peruvians , &quot; Peruvian Prime Minister Pandolfi told Ikeda . 
&quot; But if we look at it from a different perspective , we can say we produced three heroes , &quot; Pandolfi told Ikeda . 
President Alberto Fujimori moved on Friday to quash reports that the attack -- technically on Japanese terrirtory -- included the executions of two MRTA rebels and the killing of at least one other who tried to surrender . 
&quot; That is completely false . 
there were no executions , &quot; Fujimori told Reuters in his first interview since the daring military strike . 
Japan began injecting massive economic aid into Peru when Fujimori , the son of Japanese immigrants , came to power in 1990 . 
Peru , home to some 80,000 people of Japanese ancestry , is the biggest recipient of Japanese economic aid in Latin America , receiving a total of 200 billion yen ( about $ 1.6 billion ) up until 1995 . 
when Japanese Prime Minister , Ryutaro Hashimoto , visted Lima last August , he pledged 62.8 billion yen ( about $ 100 million ) in fresh low interest development loans to Peru .
