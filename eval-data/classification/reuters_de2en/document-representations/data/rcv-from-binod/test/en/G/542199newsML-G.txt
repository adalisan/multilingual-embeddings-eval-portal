Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected opposition calls for early elections on Sunday despite the lingering fog of a corruption scandal . 
in a further setback for the right-wing Likud party leader , an annual public opinion poll for the first time showed a majority of Israelis back a Palestinian state . 
I intend to correct what needs to be corrected and move forward , &quot; the prime minister , elected 11 months ago , told Israel Radio . 
Israeli opposition politicians demand elections because of an influence-peddling scandal that has rocked his government . 
a political ally , Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky , said last week the affair showed Netanyahu had yet to prove he can lead the country . 
despite insufficient evidence to bring Netanyahu to trial , prosecutors said last week there were &quot; real suspicions &quot; about his role in the short-lived appointment of an Attorney-General . 
&quot; There were certainly mistakes that I made -- I don &apos;t deny it -- throughout the whole selection process , &quot; Netanyahu told Israeli army radio . 
granting his first interviews to the Israeli media in the week since prosecutors decided not to charge him , Netanyahu said a new government committee would prevent further mistakes . 
prosecutors say his Shas party ally Aryeh Deri should be charged in the scandal while the director-general of Netanyahu &apos;s office Avigdor Lieberman faces further investigation . 
&quot; The bottom line is I didn &apos;t break the law , &quot; Netanyahu said . 
the annual poll by a leading think-tank found 51 percent of Israelis support the establishment of a Palestinian state while 49 percent oppose it . 
Netanyahu was narrowly elected prime minister last May on a platform steadfastly opposed to a Palestinian state -- an avowed goal of President Yasser Arafat . 
&quot; We have been conducting this poll for the last 10 years and this is the first time the figure has passed the 50 percent mark , &quot; said Professor Asher Arian of Tel Aviv University &apos;s Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies . 
&quot; I think the peace process has set in ... In general , there is an acceptance of Arabs , a willingness to see them as wanting peace , &quot; he told Reuters on Sunday . 
support for a Palestinian state had been growing steadily in recent years , reaching 46 percent in the 1996 poll , he said . 
the poll of 1,216 people was conducted in late February and early March before a crisis in Israel-PLO relations touched off by the start of work on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem on March 18 . 
it had a 2.8 percent margin of error . 
asked if the findings were still valid despite the turmoil , Arian said : &quot; Previous surveys teach us that public opinion changes very temporarily in response to dramatic events . 
meantime , about 200 Palestinians demonstrated near a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip on Sunday , charging Israel was expanding the outpost , witnesses said . 
&quot; If Israel continues its settlement activities here in Gaza and elsewhere , Palestinians will use every option they have to confront the settlements policy , &quot; legislator Ziad Abu Amr said at the protest . 
PLO security officials said Israel was widening the settlement of Kfar Yam . 
Arale Tzur , head of the Gaza regional council of Jewish settlements , told Reuters the Israeli army was only enlarging its position at the site . 
in Palestinian-ruled Jericho , Arafat described as &quot; a barbaric , shameful act &quot; the stabbing to death of two Israeli women whose bodies were found in the West Bank on Friday . 
Arafat said Israeli and Palestinian officers met to discuss the issue . 
Israeli police said they were investigating whether the killers were Palestinian guerrillas .
