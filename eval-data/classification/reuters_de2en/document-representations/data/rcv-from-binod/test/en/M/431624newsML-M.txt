new Zealand debt markets held onto their gains at Monday &apos;s close after a session of very quiet trade . 
dealers said sentiment was lifted at the open by U.S. treasuries &apos; favourable reaction to February jobs data . 
non-farm payrolls leaped a stronger-than-expected 339,000 in February against a revised 247,000 rise in January , while the jobless rate slipped to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent . 
the data suggested labour markets remained tight , but some U.S. players were comforted by a modest US $ 0.03 rise in average hourly earnings , which sparked a short-covering rally . 
&quot; It &apos;s held its gains and probably if anything is slightly better bid here at the close , &quot; one bond dealer said . 
the mid bonds ended seven basis points lower at 7.67 percent , while the 10-year maturity was down 10 at 7.68 percent . 
the improvement in sentiment filtered through to the short end , where 90-day bank bills managed a five basis point rally to 7.62 percent , despite the falling back of the currency &apos;s Trade-Weighted Index during the session . 
the TWI closed at 68.91 , still up from its 68.83 finish at the end of last week but well down on its intraday high of 69.16 . 
one dealer said local participants would once more be watching the U.S. &apos; s performance overnight . 
&quot; People have become really defensive and unsure which way this economy is turning . 
due to that indecision we have just taken a lead from offshore markets , rather than trading in our own right . 
&quot; But I think as we get towards the Reserve Bank &apos;s economic projections on Thursday we &apos;ll tend to go into our own shell a little bit , and we &apos;ll focus on that , &quot; he said .
