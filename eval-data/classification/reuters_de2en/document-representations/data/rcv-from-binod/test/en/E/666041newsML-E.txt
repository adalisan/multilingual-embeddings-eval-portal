new Romanian portfolio legislation will be the catalyst for a major increase in foreign equity investment , according to Heinrich Pecina , deputy chairman of Creditanstalt Investment Bank . 
&quot; With the new law , there is nothing to stop a portfolio investor , &quot; Pecina said . 
&quot; There will be more capital interested in Romania than is able to execute . 
Romania &apos;s centrist government , which won November &apos;s elections and ended seven years of ex-communist rule , announced last week a 1.5-percent tax on each portfolio transaction . 
this amended previously proposed rules setting a four-percent fee on capital gains repatriation . 
there are already more than a dozen Romania-oriented funds , and total portfolio assets ready to be invested will soon exceed $ 1 billion , Pecina said . 
Creditanstalt already reports receiving buy orders as large as $ 1 million , a size that would have been unthinkable a short time ago . 
it is also currently investigating global depositary receipt issues for Romanian companies , most likely targeted at U.S. investors . 
Pecina said he expects to see the first Romanian GDR within six to nine months . 
with the market capitalisation of the growing but still small Bucharest Stock Exchange at only about $ 370 million , according to Creditanstalt , he said he could easily see a liquidity-driven rise in equities . 
&quot; Capital flows will come in , prices will shoot up and there will be high volatility , &quot; Pecina said . 
a strong influx of hot &apos; money could pose dangers for foreign investors . 
Pecina noted that the Warsaw and Budapest stock exchanges shot up following investment liberalisation , only to retreat when more sober valuations took hold . 
but unlike many emerging markets , Romania has a strong capital markets infrastructure in place to deal with any influx , according to Creditanstalt . 
&quot; Romania has the markets , it has central share registry , the legal framework and settlements , &quot; Pecina said . 
&quot; You can actually execute , but you have to locate the shares . 
but in many cases , shares have been highly diffused by privatisation programmes and can be hard for foreign investors to locate . 
despite the potential for volatility , Creditanstalt sees positive fundamentals for many Romanian companies , particularly in the brewing and chemical sectors . 
&quot; The markets are moving in the right direction very rapidly . 
many of the listed companies had time to get prepared . 
they have room for capital expenditure that will be supported by real , underlying growth , &quot; Pecina said . 
he said Creditantalt is currently in talks with about a dozen Romanian companies in need of capital increases of between $ 30-50 million . 
&quot; Some of these companies want to increase capacity because they are at 120 percent . 
many are export-driven , &quot; Pecina said .
