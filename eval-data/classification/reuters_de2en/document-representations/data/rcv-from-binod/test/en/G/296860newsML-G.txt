the purist Islamic Taleban issued guidelines on Thursday for Afghans during Ramadan , the lunar month of fasting for Moslems , confining most women to their homes and banning public eating and entertainment . 
Ramadan is expected to begin in Afghanistan on Friday or Saturday . 
during the period Moslems are not allowed to eat , drink or smoke in daylight hours . 
the guidelines were prepared by the the department for promoting good and suppressing vice . 
the department has produced a seven-point document for the guidance of their fellow Afghans , according to Mullah Enayatullah Baligh , the department &apos;s deputy head . 
&quot; All hotels and eating places in Kabul and throughout Afghanistan should be closed during the day for the month of Ramazan ( Ramadan ) , &quot; said the document . 
&quot; Our esteemed sisters are asked not to venture out of their houses without a legal excuse . 
in case they have to leave their houses they should be veiled from the head to below the ankle , &quot; the document continued . 
Baligh explained that there were a number of legal reasons for which a woman could leave the house . 
&quot; They can leave their houses to buy food , or visit patients in the hospital , or go to a funeral for example , but they should not just wander around in the markets and parks . 
&quot; If a man sees a woman during Ramazan , he will be provoked , &quot; said Baligh in explanation of the restrictions on women . 
musical entertainment or parties in hotels or private houses is also forbidden during Ramadan , the document said . 
Baligh explained that the aim of the clause was to encourage people to go to the mosque at night for &apos; Taraveh &apos; , the Ramadan prayers , and the study of the Islamic holy book , the Koran , which also takes place at night during Ramadan . 
&quot; All countrymen should attend the recitation of the Holy Koran and Taraveh prayers ... &quot; , the guidelines said . 
Baligh said that the 9.00 p.m. curfew the Taleban imposed on Kabul when they took the city in late September last year would be relaxed to allow people to go to the mosque . 
&quot; The curfew is not strictly enforced now : it is only there to curtail cases of robbery and looting , but there will be full freedom until 10.30 or 11 o &apos;clock to allow people to go to Taraveh . 
Baligh stressed the Taleban would not be conducting house to house searches to ensure people attended the mosque , and that the sick and those with other valid reasons would be excused . 
&quot; These are only guidelines . 
we won &apos;t be forcing people out of their houses and into the mosque , &quot; he said . 
the guidelines also urged those who have enough food to help their more needy neighbours . 
it is a tradition , particularly during Ramadan , for the rich to help the poor , but it is one that gains particular poignancy in Afghanistan . 
after 17 years of war , many people are unable to afford sufficient food . 
the International Committee of the Red Cross estimate that 57 per cent of the population of Afghanistan are malnourished . 
the United Nations World Food Programme estimates that half of Kabul &apos;s population recieve food aid of some sort . 
&quot; Foreigners , travellers and the sick ( all groups who are exempted from fasting during Ramazan ) cannot eat or drink in front of those who are keeping the fast , &quot; say the guidelines . 
&quot; It would be rude for you to eat in front of someone who is keeping the fast , &quot; Baligh told a non-Moslem Reuters correspondent . 
&quot; You can eat and smoke in your room , but if you do it in public , we will arrest you , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Those who break the fast , or do not keep it at all will be punished in the basis of Shariat ( Islamic Law ) , &quot; the guidelines concluded .
