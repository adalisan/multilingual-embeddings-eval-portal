Malaysian rubber prices ended mixed on Monday with the market adjusting itself to a further weakening of the ringgit , dealers said . 
&quot; It has to be the currency ... there &apos;s nothing else apparent , &quot; said a trader . 
dealers did not report any business for the day , adding that volumes were thin at best . 
in the rubber market , the RSS1 for September buyer closed at 251.50 cents ( 90 cents U.S. ) , up one cent from Friday . 
the SMR20 for September buyer was quoted half-cent down at 249.50 cents a kg . 
traders said at midday that buyers could be looking at the Jakarta rubber market because the rupiah had fallen more drastically than the ringgit since last week , making prices of Indonesian rubber more attractive . 
the INRO five-day indicator was at 192.41 Malaysian / Singapore cents a kg on Aug 15 from 192.18 on Aug 14 . 
the daily price was at 192.47 from 192.73 previously .
