Dutch oilseed firms crushed 3.48 million tonnes of seeds in the first nine months of the year , against almost 3.59 million tonnes in the same period in 1995 , the Dutch oils and fats board ( MVO ) said on Tuesday . 
the soya crush dropped 3.4 percent to 2.90 million tonnes , having fallen in each of the three quarters of 1996 to 980,900 tonnes , 965,900 and 949,300 tonnes . 
unfavourable prices for rapeseed continued to affect the crush in the Netherlands . 
MVO said the rapeseed crush dropped to 92,300 tonnes in the first nine months against 1995 &apos;s 139,600 . 
this has led to imports of rape oil from Germany , it added . 
but sunflowerseeds have fallen in price , making their crush process more profitable and pushing up the 1996 nine-month total 5.6 percent to 414,000 tonnes . 
linseed processing increased by more than 50 percent to 69,900 tonnes in the period .
