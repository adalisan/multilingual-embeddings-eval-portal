Mexico blasted a U.S. Congress vote on Thursday that censured its anti-drug efforts , calling the vote unacceptable , harmful to U.S.-Mexican relations and helpful only to drug traffickers . 
&quot; The resolution of the House of Representatives sends a wrong signal to Mexico and the world . 
the resolution damages international cooperation in the fight against drugs and benefits our common enemy : drug trafficking , &quot; the Foreign Ministry said in a statement . 
the Ministry threatened unspecified reprisals against Washington if the Congressional vote proved damaging to Mexican &quot; sovereignty , dignity and the well-being of Mexicans . 
it also branded as &quot; unacceptable &quot; any attempt to impose conditions on Mexico , after the House voted to &quot; decertify &quot; Mexico &apos;s anti-narcotics efforts in 90 days unless President Bill Clinton demonstrated that its performance had improved . 
Clinton , who approved Mexico &apos;s drug cooperation record last month , had sought to stop Congress censuring Mexico , and the Mexican government applauded him for that . 
&quot; The Mexican government shows its appreciation for the respect that President Clinton has repeatedly demonstrated towards our country and for his interest in improving cooperation between both governments , &quot; the Foreign Ministry said .
