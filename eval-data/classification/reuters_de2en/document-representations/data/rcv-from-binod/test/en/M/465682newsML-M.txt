Zimbabwe &apos;s key share index tumbled 51.80 points to 10,320.89 on Tuesday in a market where losers outnumbered gainers by 18 to six , but which brokers expect to trade generally balanced during the week . 
the 59-counter industrial index was driven down largely by falls in bluechips conglomerate Zimbabwe Newspapers , sugar producer Hippo Valley and hotel and supermarkets chain Meikles , which lost 300 cents to 5,000 , 50 cents each to 1,400 and to 2,600 respectively . 
&quot; There was a bit of profit-taking here and there , but for the week it &apos;s still looking fairly balanced , &quot; one broker said . 
the secondary seven-share mining index climbed 3.74 points to 993.30 after a 50-cent rise in gold miners Rio tinto to 2,650 .
