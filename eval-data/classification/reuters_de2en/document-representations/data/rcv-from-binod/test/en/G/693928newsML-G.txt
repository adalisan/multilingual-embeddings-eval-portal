a key East Timor rebel leader who died of gunshot wounds after being captured in a gunbattle was buried without incident in the capital , Dili , the Indonesian military said on Friday . 
&quot; David Alex was buried at a public cemetary in Dili on Thursday afternoon and the burial was attended by his relatives . 
there was no incident overnight and it seems that the local people largely ignored his death , &quot; an army lieutenant on duty told Reuters by telephone from Dili . 
Alex was believed to be second in command of about 200 guerrillas from the military wing of the pro-independence Fretilin party , which has opposed Indonesia &apos;s rule in East Timor since Jakarta &apos;s 1975 invasion and annexation of the former Portuguese colony the following year . 
military officials said Alex died of gunshot wounds after a gunbattle in Baucau , about 100 km ( 62 miles ) east of Dili , on Wednesday , in which five of his men were also captured . 
they said Alex died on Wednesday night from blood loss after being flown to Dili for treatment . 
&quot; Alex was shot in his left hand and right thigh . 
he was given intensive treatment , but he died because he lost too much blood , &quot; the lieutenant said . 
he said Alex had masterminded a number of attacks against the military and civilians since May . 
he said the rebel was also behind last Saturday &apos;s ambush of a convoy of Indonesian soldiers in Laleia , about 66 km ( 40 miles ) east of Dili , in which one soldier was killed . 
sources close to the East Timorese resistance movement said Alex and four other men had apparently been captured on Wednesday morning in a confrontation in Kaibada , near Baucau . 
resistance sources said Alex was interrogated before being flown to Dili . 
Australian supporters of the East Timor resistance movement have urged Australia &apos;s envoy to Indonesia to begin an immediate investigation into Alex &apos;s death . 
the territory has been hit by the worst upsurge of violence in years after separatists sought to disrupt Indonesia &apos;s May 29 general elections with a series of attacks in East Timor . 
at least 35 people have died in the clashes , including 16 policemen and a soldier in one ambush .
