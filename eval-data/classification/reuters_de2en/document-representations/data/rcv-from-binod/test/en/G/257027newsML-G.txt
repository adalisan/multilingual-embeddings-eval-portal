Iran said on Saturday it plans to organise a football tournament on the Gulf island of Abu Musa , which is at the center of a dispute with neighbouring United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) since 1992 , Iran &apos;s state-run news agency IRNA reported . 
IRNA , monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) , quoted the island &apos;s governor Hasan Riza &apos;i as saying that the choice of Abu Musa for the second year running was for its &quot; favourable climate &quot; . 
the agency did not give more details , but sources familiar with Iran &apos;s soccer competitions said only local teams from neighbouring towns will participate . 
Gulf Arab leaders earlier this week called on Iran to end its &quot; occupation &quot; of the three Gulf islands of Abu Musa , Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb claimed by the UAE . 
Iran says its sovreignty over the islands is not negotiable .
