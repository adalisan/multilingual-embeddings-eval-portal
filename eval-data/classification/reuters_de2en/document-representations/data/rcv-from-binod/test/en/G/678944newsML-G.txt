the son of imprisoned Egyptian cleric Omar Abdel-Rahman said on Sunday the U.S. Bureau of Prisons had withdrawn the sheikh &apos;s telephone privileges , cutting off his main link with his family in Egypt . 
Abdullah Omar Abdel-Rahman , 22 , told Reuters in an interview that the sheikh used to call about once a week from the federal prison in Springfield , Missouri . 
the sheikh , convicted of conspiring to blow up the United Nations headquarters and other New York landmarks , has been in the jail for nearly a year and a half . 
last month his lawyers filed a civil rights lawsuit , arguing that the blind Egyptian preacher &apos;s health had deteriorated because of his time in solitary confinement . 
they also said prison officials had taken away the special watch and compass the sheikh uses for knowing when and in which direction to pray . 
his son , who is training to be a Moslem preacher at the same institute where his father once taught , said : &quot; The last time I spoke to him was about a month ago . 
right now America is very stubborn and they recently cancelled his telephone privileges and refuse to let him have visitors . 
&quot; He lives in a tiny cell and they refuse to give him medicine ... 
the United States is supposed to be the land of democracy and the defender of human rights , then why does it abuse Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman ? 
&quot; he added . 
Abdullah denied that his father was the emir ( commander ) of the militant Gama &apos;a Al-Islamiya , the largest organisation fighting to overthrow the Egyptian government , saying he was just a mufti , or authority on religious law . 
in a recent statement on the sheikh &apos;s conditions in prison , another group , the Jihad Movement-Vanguards of conquest , hailed him as emir , a title he had not previously enjoyed . 
&quot; My father said he was not anyone &apos;s emir but that he was everyone &apos;s mufti , &quot; said Abdullah . 
&quot; The Gama &apos;a Al-Islamiya thinks that Omar was the best with fatwas ( rulings on religious law ) . 
he fears no one but God and that helped him . 
all of the Islamic groups listened to his fatwas , not just the Gama &apos;a , &quot; he added . 
the son said he would take seriously Islamist threats to attack U.S. interests if any harm comes to the sheikh . 
&quot; The Gama &apos;a sent the ( threatening ) statement because they love Omar and are afraid for him . 
they said they would sacrifice their lives to save Omar Abdel-Rahman . 
anyone who is a true Moslem should work to free Sheikh Omar , &quot; he added .
