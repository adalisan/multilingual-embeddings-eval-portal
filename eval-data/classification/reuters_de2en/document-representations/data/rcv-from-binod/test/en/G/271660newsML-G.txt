the hostages held at the Japanese embassy residence in Peru , who include high-ranking diplomats , businessmen and government officials , are living on provisions worth just $ 1.50 a day , a local newspaper said on Saturday . 
local firms and relatives of the roughly 340 hostages have donated food , water , clothing and medicines , while the Red Cross has assumed the cost of ferrying the supplies to the compound , Red Cross officials said . 
the Red Cross , however , said it had not made an estimate of the logistical cost of its humanitarian work at the siege . 
the captives , who were taken hostage late on Tuesday by Marxist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary guerrillas ( MRTA ) while attending a lavish cocktail and sushi reception , spent nearly four days in the same crumpled suits until clothing was allowed in to the compound mid-Saturday , the Red Cross said . 
relatives had to obey strict rules laid down by the rebels and donated only white , cotton clothes that could not conceal other objects , police at the site said . 
a private firm provided 14 portable field toilets for the hostages &apos; use and prepared to receive them at regular intervals to pump out the excrement before sending them back in , Wilfredo Yarmas Merel , of the Disal company , said . 
the hostages on Saturday continued to plead with the government to reconnect water , electricity and telephone services to the residence by thrusting hand-written placards up to a barred window of the residence . 
the MRTA divided up the cramped space and meagre rations in equal proportions and have held ideological group debates with their captives .
