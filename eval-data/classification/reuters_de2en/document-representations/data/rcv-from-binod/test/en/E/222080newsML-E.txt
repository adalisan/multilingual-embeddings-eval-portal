Sri Lanka &apos;s economy is ending the year on an upbeat note after recovering from a crippling drought , but a high budget deficit and inflation remain worries , an International Monetary Fund official said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Agricultural production is getting back to normal after the drought and should have a favourable impact on food prices and inflation , which is about 20 percent now , &quot; Thomas K. Morrison , the IMF &apos;s resident representative in Sri Lanka , told Reuters . 
underlying the inflation equation are the high deficits of 1994-96 , which the IMF says averaged about 10 percent of GDP ( gross domestic product ) . 
the IMF sees the primary reasons for the high deficits as over-runs in defence and social welfare spending , and reliance on privatisation receipts that fell short of projections . 
defence spending overshot estimates by almost 10 billion rupees ( US $ 176 million ) a year in 1995 and 1996 after the government intensified its push against Tamil rebels fighting for a separate state in the north and east . 
privatisation netted three billion rupees in 1995 , against estimates of four billion . 
public Enterprise Reform officials say the actual figure in 1996 should be about 11 billion rupees , against forecasts of 22 billion rupees . 
the ambitious reforms , which include privatising infrastructure , airlines and plantations , have been slowed by resistance from labour and the domestic private sector . 
&quot; The government recognises the need for reducing the deficit , and the way they hope to do it in 1997 , which is by cutting current expenditure , is good , &quot; Morrison said . 
the 1997 budget proposals presented in parliament on November 6 said the government expected to hold defence spending to 44 billion rupees , down from an estimated 50 billion in 1996 , and cut recurrent expenditures by 20 percent . 
spending on social welfare , including subsidies on wheat flour and fertiliser and a stipend for the poor , has been pared to about 10 billion rupees in 1997 from 16 billion this year . 
the main reduction in 1997 comes from cutting the wheat flour subsidy to one billion rupees from about six billion in 1996 , analysts say . 
Morrison said there was a misconception that the IMF was against subsidies . 
&quot; This is not true , because every country in the world has subsidies . 
the point is , subsidies should be made efficient so that they won &apos;t strain the budget . 
due to escalating grain prices and lack of targetting , which saw even Colombo &apos;s five-star hotels buying subsidised flour , the wheat flour subsidy was pinching the budget , he said . 
&quot; The IMF is also not for subsidising a particular commodity , which causes a distortion . 
for instance , you upset local rice farmers by subsidising imported wheat flour . 
overall , the IMF is pleased with the 1997 budget because of the government &apos;s commitment to cut the deficit significantly , he said . 
&quot; The amount of deficit reduction , which is about 2.5 percentage points of GDP to 7.5 percent in 1997 , is ambitious but a good plan , &quot; he said . 
reaching the target depends on good implementation , which will require monitoring and the political will to make tough decisions , Morrison said . 
the IMF and the Asian Development Bank are helping the treasury improve accounting in order to spot expenditure over-runs and react quickly to them , he said .
