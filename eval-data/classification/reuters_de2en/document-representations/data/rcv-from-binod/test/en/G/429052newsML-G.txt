aid officials flew deep into rebel-held east Zaire on Sunday , hunting for hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees trekking into the dense jungles of the interior . 
a senior U.N. aid official and representatives of four U.N. agencies and Medecins sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) left by plane from the eastern city of Goma , rebel headquarters . 
they planned to fly to an abandoned refugee camp at Tingi Tingi and other nearby airstrips , the first time the rebels have allowed aid agencies access to areas near the frontlines to the west . 
&quot; A flight yesterday which did not land ... did not find many refugees . 
we do not expect to find that many today , &quot; said Paul Stromberg , spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . 
&quot; The mission is to work out how bases can be established that would attract refugees and where there could be a permanent expatriate presence of aid workers , &quot; he added in Goma city . 
most of 170,000 Burundian and Rwandan refugees who nine days ago abandoned a makeshift camp at Tingi Tingi headed west to Ubundu on the Zaire river and towards the regional capital of Kisangani . 
but Kisangani , capital of the northwest and with its airport a major military base , is the leading target for the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire . 
the U.N. World Food Programme ( WFP ) said it and Caritas started on Saturday distributing food brought to Ubundu by rail from Kisangani to between 10,000 and 20,000 refugees and Zairean displaced . 
aid workers said they expected more people fleeing the rebel advance to arrive in Ubundu in the next few days . 
many children and elderly are malnourished or sick after months on the road . 
Stromberg said any return of the refugees home to Rwanda and Burundi depended on a ceasefire , which on Saturday was ruled out by rebel leader Laurent Kabila before President Mobutu Sese Seko agrees to talks . 
Zaire &apos;s government on Wednesday accepted a five-point U.N. peace plan , of which the first item is an immediate ceasefire , under pressure from the rebel advances in the east and south . 
but the rebels say they will only negotiate with ailing 66-year-old Mobutu and only about his standing down from power . 
the president , who is believed to have amassed a personal fortune of billions of dollars in his 31 years of rule over Africa &apos;s third largest country , is now staying in the south of France following surgery for prostrate cancer last August . 
UNHCR says some 350,000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees have plunged deep into the dense jungle of eastern Zaire since fleeing their camps in border areas of the east to escape the rebellion since October spearheaded by ethnic Tutsi Zaireans . 
the refugees include former Rwandan troops and extremist militiamen who led Rwanda &apos;s genocide and are fighting alongside Zairean forces in a desperate bid to turn back the rebels . 
the refugees , former troops and militiamen fled Rwanda in 1994 in fear of reprisals for the 1994 genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates and say they will be killed by the rebels . 
Kabila said on Saturday rebel forces were encountering stiff resistance from the former Rwandan troops but were within 50 km ( 30 miles ) of the city and advancing from several directions .
