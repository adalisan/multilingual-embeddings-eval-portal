more than 500 foreign and local companies displayed goods and services on Thursday at the start of Ivory Coast &apos;s trade fair which authorities say is to show the world the country &apos;s &quot; new face &quot; . 
&quot; This trade fair is aimed at displaying the new face of Ivory Coast companies to domestic and international competition , &quot; Chamber of Commerce president Seydou Diarra said . 
EXPO-CI 96 is Ivory Coast &apos;s first trade exhibition in 11 years and the first since a 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 , a move partly intended to make French-speaking African states sharing the French-backed currency more competitive . 
ivory Coast has since embarked on wide-ranging donor-backed economic reforms highlighting liberalisation and foreign investment as a means of achieving sustainable growth . 
the former French colony is also opening up to investors outside the traditional French sphere of influence , who are showing interest in the mining and energy sector . 
products on display ranged from textiles and processed foods to motor vehicles . 
services were across the sectors of energy , mining , wood , communication and banking . 
Mohamed Diabate , sales manager of Nestle -Ivory Coast said : &quot; We are here both to promote our products and to support the government &apos;s efforts to foster industry . 
the economy is projected to grow by seven percent in 1996 . 
Prime Minister Daniel Duncan , architect of the reforms , says the target is double-digit growth by 2000 to put Ivory Coast in the same camp as the &quot; Tiger &quot; economies of Asia . 
some stands belonged to former state-owned enterprises privatised as part of the reforms . 
more than 20 of 60 slated firms have been privatised . 
some participants urged governments of the sub-region to take steps to remove or reduce trade barriers and taxes . 
&quot; Too much taxes encourages fraud , &quot; said Tonato Atiry from Sobetex , a textile company from Benin . 
about 10,000 visitors a day are expected at the fair which closes on November 17 .
