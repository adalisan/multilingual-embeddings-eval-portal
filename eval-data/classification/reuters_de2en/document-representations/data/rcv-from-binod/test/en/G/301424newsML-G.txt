Bolivia resurrected their chances of reaching the 1998 World Cup finals when they beat 10-man Ecuador 2-0 on Sunday to end a poor run in the South American qualifying tournament . 
Bolivia effectively wrapped up the game in the first 12 minutes when they scored both of their goals through former Middlesbrough striker Jaime Moreno and their top player Marco Etcheverry . 
they had been held to draws in their last three home games , despite the advantage of playing at 3,600 metres above sea level in La Paz . 
altitude was seen as crucial when Bolivia qualified for the last World Cup after winning all their home games , with Brazil among the victims . 
the result took Bolivia above Ecuador on goal difference and level on points with Uruguay and Argentina , who were playing later on Sunday . 
Moreno shot Bolivia ahead with a left foot drive in the seventh minute following a corner and five minutes later help set up the second for Etcheverry with a neat exchange of passes which carved up the Ecuador defence . 
Ecuador midfielder hector Carabali was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 65th minute .
