Romania &apos;s average monthly inflation quickened to 3.0 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 from 1.7 percent a year earlier , National Statistics Board ( CNS ) data showed on Monday . 
data showed monthly inflation in the food sector , which takes the bulk of consumer spending , was 2.7 percent over January-October , up from 1.5 percent last year . 
non-food sector inflation was 3.1 percent , up from 1.7 percent , and service sector inflation was 3.5 percent , up from 2.7 . 
in October monthly inflation was 3.4 percent and year-on- year inflation 45.1 percent , close to 45.3 percent in September . 
the 1996 official inflation estimate was revised up to 30 percent from an IMF-directed target of 20 percent , but local economists say it will be higher , near 45 percent , because of energy and fuel price rises in July and rising budget spending . 
under pressure from the World Bank to bring energy prices closer to international levels , Romania increased electricity and thermal power prices by 58 percent and the price of fuel by some 30 percent in early July . 
the rises pushed July &apos;s inflation rate to 7.5 percent , the largest monthly increase in two years . 
but Romania has made progress in slashing inflation from the hyperinflation of the immediate post-communist years . 
inflation fell to 27.8 percent last year from 61.7 in 1994 and almost 300 percent in 1993 . 
it is forecast at 20 percent in 1997 .
