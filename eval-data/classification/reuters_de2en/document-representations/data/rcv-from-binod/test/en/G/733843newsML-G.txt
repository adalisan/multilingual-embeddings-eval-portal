the release of radical Islamist leader Abassi Madani sparked questions and uncertainty in Algeria on Wednesday , with some warning that his once powerful Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) could not be trusted . 
&quot; The Islamists of the FIS are fanatics who consider any measure of mercy a sign of weakness , &quot; said the influential El Watan newspaper , pointing out that Madani had always refused to denounce the violence which has rocked Algeria for nearly six years . 
it said the FIS chief &apos;s release on Tuesday from a 12 year jail term imposed in 1992 was received &quot; as a cold shower by Algerian democratic forces &quot; . 
Liberte newspaper said that only hours after he was freed , Madani was closeted with former senior FIS men , including Abdelkader Hachani who himself had only been freed last week . 
&quot; According to the witness of one of those he was speaking to ... Abassi , who was in very good health , reportedly gave his visitors a &apos; very virulent speech against the authorities &apos; , &quot; the newspaper said . 
the FIS leadership in exile on Tuesday welcomed Madani &apos;s release as &quot; a definite and effective contribution to solving the crisis and returning to peace and stbaility &quot; . 
several Algerian commentators saw freeing Madani as a sign of confidence by the authorities as they headed towards local elections which some newspapers said would be held on October 23 . 
more than half the townhalls were captured by the FIS in the country &apos;s first multi-party elections in 1990 , but their councils were abolished and replaced by government appointees as violence swept Algeria . 
the Arabic-language newspaper al-Hayat said on Wednesday that Madani told a senior FIS member in Brussels by telephone : &quot; My release was not part of any deal ... I went out ( of jail ) without any conditions and I did not sign any pledge . 
the London-based paper quoted FIS member Ahmed el-Zawi as saying he phoned Madani shortly after his release on Tuesday . 
Zawi said Algerian authorities did not put any restrictions on Madani &apos;s &quot; political freedom &quot; . 
their only request was that he give a verbal pledge not to leave Algeria without permission . 
Madani refused . 
Algerian political parties , reported by Liberte newspaper , mostly saw the release as a step towards restoring stability . 
the former sole ruling National Liberation Front ( FLN ) , now a junior member of the coalition government formed after last June 5 general election , said it supported any measure favouring a return to calm and the end of violence . 
around 60,000 people have been killed since violence erupted after the authorities in January 1992 cancelled a general election in which the FIS had taken a huge lead . 
the bloodshed has continued and about 400 people have died since last June 5 when Algeria held fresh general elections from which the outlawed FIS was excluded . 
the Islamist-leaning Movement of a Peaceful Society , also a member of government with seven posts , said freeing Madani was a step towards easing Algeria &apos;s situation . 
&quot; We hope this measure will serve the security and stability of the citizens , &quot; a spokesman said . 
the Nahda party welcomed Madani &apos;s release and called for the lifting of the state of emergency , still in force after being imposed in 1992 . 
in the secularist newspaper Le Matin , its director , Mohamed Benchicou , wrote : &quot; The liberation of Abassi Madani being accompanied by no official declaration ... will inevitably be viewed as a breach to be widened . 
&quot; The armed wing of the FIS will multiply acts of terrorism to obtain still more , just as the freeing of Hachani was followed by dozens of killings .
