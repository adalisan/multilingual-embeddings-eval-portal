* Market players gave the currency back some strength during the afternoon after the Bank of Canada failed to cut . 
market players are still watching the central bank closely however after disappointing Canadian employment data on Friday , said dealers . 
a Reuters survey of economists had forecast the unemployment rate to drop to 9.3 percent and employment to grow by 37,000 in September . 
but full-time employment fell by 86,000 , wiping out the 72,000 gain in August and cutting the year &apos;s total gains in half . 
&quot; We believe there &apos;s an opportunity for another ease here , &quot; said Wateridge . 
on the crosses , Canada &apos;s dollar fell to 1.1313 marks from Thursday &apos;s close of 1.1316 marks but rose to 82.44 yen from 83.35 yen .
