Peru &apos;s Central Reserve Bank said Friday its net international reserves fell $ 190 million to $ 8.909 billion on March 12 from $ 9.099 billion the previous week . 
&quot; The drop was mainly due to the withdrawal of public sector deposits for the close of the Brady Plan , &quot; the bank said in its weekly report . 
Peru closed its Brady plan debt restructuring accord with commercial creditors last week . 
the government financed the deal with a loan package from multilateral creditors and state funds . 
the central bank also said its foreign exchange position , or total liquidity minus short and long-term debt obligations , was $ 1.753 billion on March 12 . 
Peru &apos;s reserves ended 1996 at $ 8.540 billion . 
the government estimates the country &apos;s international reserves will rise above $ 10 billion by mid-1998 .
