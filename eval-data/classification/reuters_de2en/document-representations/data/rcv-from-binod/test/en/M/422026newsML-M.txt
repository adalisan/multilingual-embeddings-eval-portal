leading Russian shares slipped on Wednesday amid strong fluctuations , traders said . 
the Russian Trading System index of 23 shares fell to 311.10 from 320.33 on Tuesday on total market volume of $ 30.22 million . 
traders gave mixed forecasts about the market in the next few days . 
but they all agreed that a possible government reshuffle on Thursday with the appointment of presidential Chief-of-Staff Anatoly Chubais as First Deputy Prime Minister would push prices up as the West would find Chubais to their liking . 
&quot; Chubais is good for me as a speculator , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; Tomorrow the West can start buying on the news , although it is pointless to move the market strongly now . 
Kremlin sources privately confirmed media reports saying that , barring a last minute rethink , the government will be reshuffled and Chubais will become first deputy to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . 
renaissance Capital trader Vladimir Chkhikvadze forecast a price rise on Thursday as the market slipped on Wednesday on Russian sales . 
&quot; taken that price levels are quite attractive for buying now , we cannot rule out some upward correction , &quot; he said . 
Trinfiko &apos;s senior trader Grigory Pinsky said he saw aggressive Western sales and rouble bid prices and forecast continuing fall in the market in the next few days . 
&quot; Hard currency sellers obviously have more strength than rouble buyers , &quot; he said .
