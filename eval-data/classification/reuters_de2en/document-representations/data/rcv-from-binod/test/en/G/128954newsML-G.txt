a British gun lobby group said on Sunday it planned to field a candidate in the Scottish parliamentary seat that includes Dunblane , where 16 children and their teacher were massacred by a gunman last March . 
the announcement by the Shooters &apos; Rights Association came just days after Britain &apos;s Conservative government announced plans for a massive crackdown on the ownership of handguns in an attempt to avert another similar tragedy . 
Pro-gun groups said the government &apos;s proposals , which would outlaw all but the smallest calibre pistols , went too far . 
the Shooters &apos; Rights Association said it planned to put up a candidate against Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth , whose highly-marginal constituency of Stirling includes Dunblane . 
his majority is just 703 and a general election must be held by next May . 
Scottish nationalist member of parliament Roseanna Cunningham attacked the move as &quot; beyond belief &quot; . 
&quot; This can only add to the distress of people in Dunblane and those directly affected by the tragedy , and I think it is despicable that the gun lobby could be so hurtful as to even consider standing , &quot; she said . 
the Shooters &apos; Rights Association , which claims to have 6,000 members in Britain , said it would challenge Forsyth in protest at the government &apos;s proposed handgun curbs . 
the association &apos;s secretary , Richard Law , said the candidate could be his wife Elizabeth , but this had yet to be decided . 
&quot; The government have gone too far . 
they are scapegoating decent people for police ineptitude , and they should address the real problem instead , &quot; he said . 
law said the problem lay not in guns but in their licensing , and added that the Dunblane masscare occurred because of failures in this respect by Scottish police .
