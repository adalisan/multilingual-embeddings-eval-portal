December Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s ( S &amp; P ) 500 futures are poised to easily hurdle the 700.00 level and climb toward 706.00 , possibly before Friday &apos;s September U.S. employment report , technicians said . 
nearby S &amp; P 500 futures early on Wednesday rose to a new all-time high for a lead-month contract , leaping past the old peak of 697.50 set on September 24 . 
the contract , buoyed by a continued strong performance in U.S. Treasury bond futures , touched 700.00 after midday on Wednesday . 
despite the contract &apos;s slightly overbought condition -- the relative strength index was above 70 heading into Wednesday &apos;s session -- analysts said other factors could prevail near-term , especially if S &amp; P 500s and T-bond futures close strong . 
&quot; A close in this region , above this series of highs we &apos;ve gotten to ... above 697.50 would be great , &quot; said Steve Boyajian , director of technical analysis , mms International . 
if that occurs , Boyajian expected S &amp; Ps could rise to a measuring objective at 711.25 , derived from the rally shown on the daily bar chart from the July 16 low at 616.05 to the August 22 peak at 678.50 to the September 3 low at 648.80 . 
&quot; I think we could could hit this target ( 711.25 ) by the end of the week , &quot; Boyajian added . 
&quot; I still basically feel from here that we &apos;ll be moving on up to about 706.00 , probably within the next couple days , &quot; said Terence Gabriel , technical analyst , I.D.E.A. 
Inc . &quot; And then further on from there , I think it &apos;s also reasonable to look for a move on up to 725.00 as medium-term target . 
Gabriel cited several reasons for his bias , noting that the trends in most major equity indices &quot; are strongly positive , so that I &apos;m looking basically for the Dow to move on up to 6,000 in fairly near term and then up to 6,200 . 
currently , each point in S &amp; P 500 futures roughly equals 8.5 points in the Dow 30 Industrials , so a rise in the Dow to 6,000 would equate a parallel rise in S &amp; Ps to about 706.00 . 
the Dow &apos;s weekly Bollinger band width is also rising off nearly two-year lows and cleared Gabriel &apos;s signal line in early September . 
he said that suggested a market &quot; on the verge of a trending resolution &quot; after a six-month trading range . 
but not all analysts expect a straight shot higher . 
&quot; I still think we &apos;re vulnerable to a little swing back to work off the overbought condition , &quot; said Greg NIE , senior vice president , technical research , EVEREN Securities . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t be surprised to see a little backing and filling going into the ( jobs ) number on Friday , &quot; NIE added . 
he said New York Stock Exchange volume during the recent swing higher was not high enough to keep momentum going . 
&quot; I think at this stage of the game it &apos;s going to require a continuation of the really robust volume to counteract the overbought condition , &quot; he said . 
but NIE also noted that December S &amp; P 500s recently have respected trendline support at the 685.00 level on pullbacks and that any correction likely would halt in the low-690 to upper-680 area .
