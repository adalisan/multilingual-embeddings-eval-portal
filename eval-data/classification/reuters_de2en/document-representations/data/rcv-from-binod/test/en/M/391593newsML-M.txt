Spanish government bonds closed higher for the first time this week on Thursday , supported by a recovering peseta and by a stronger Italian debt market . 
preliminary data on February Italian CPI were boosting the Btps , and dealers said they should also support bonos tomorrow . 
&quot; In the last few months we had a very high correlation between Italian and Spanish inflation ... so this is good news for us as well , &quot; a dealer in Madrid said . 
the 10-year spread over Bunds narrowed as a result to 119 basis points from 125 bps . 
Italian inflation is expected to stay at 2.3 percent year-on-year in February versus a forecast of 2.5 percent . 
although modest , a steepening in the yield curve was considered a good sign of a recovered calm in the market . 
the spread between the two- and the 10-year bonds rose to 117 basis points from 115 basis points at yesterday &apos;s close . 
&quot; After yesterday we had less tension in the money market thanks to a stronger peseta , &quot; a dealer said .
