a high-level international think tank on Latin America warned on Sunday of a backlash against reform unless countries in the region showed strong and sustainable growth . 
&quot; If they can &apos;t show consistent growth over time , the populations may start rejecting some of these reforms , &quot; said William Rhodes , vice-chairman of the Institute of International Finance ( IIF ) reseach body . 
speaking to reporters at a briefing before Monday &apos;s opening of the Inter-American Development Bank &apos;s 38th annual meeting , Rhodes said increased social spending was vital to underpin reform . 
&quot; One of the challenges ... is the need to convince the population of these countries that the economic reform process should be supported , including ( deciding ) how to handle the unemployment that &apos;s created by restructuring these economies , &quot; he said , pointing to stubbornly high jobless levels , particularly in Argentina . 
&quot; That &apos;s where you &apos;ve got to put continued emphasis on education and health , &quot; said Rhodes , vice-chairman of Citibank and former head of the major banking advisory committees during Latin America &apos;s 1980s debt crisis . 
Michael Atkin , director of the IIF &apos;s Latin America department , said the region needed average growth of well over 3.0 percent before any inroads could be made in its endemic poverty levels . 
&quot; You need something like just over three percent overall growth for the region as a whole in order to stay where you are in terms of per capita income and social inequality , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Our estimate for 1996 is 3.6 percent -- you &apos;re just beginning to take the first nibble at some of these problems at that kind of level , and we see growth in 1997 at around 4.5 percent -- that &apos;s beginning to be in the area where real progress can be made . 
Latin America has embarked over the past decade on a far-reaching reform programme designed to savage inflation , slash its deficits and open up its economies to foreign participation . 
but the drive to restructure and privatise , implemented to varying degrees across the region , has brought with it high levels of unemployment and reductions in social security . 
investors are starting to fear that what is good news for the markets may produce a backlash on the ground , with implications for political stability looking ahead . 
asked which nations posed the greatest risk to investors , IIF Director Charles Dallara said Brazil had a window of opportunity to push through vital reforms . 
&quot; I think Brazil does merit some close watching , &quot; he said , pointing to its urgent need for fiscal reform . 
&quot; They &apos;re in a phase where they can face these difficult reforms . 
for Brazil to manage its external imbalances , its exchange rate is not an uncomplicated task . 
Mexico faced the challenge of being able to evolve politically while maintaining sound economic policies , while oil-rich Venezuela still needed to diversify its economy . 
Rhodes stressed that the implementation of Brazil &apos;s pension fund reform was critical , that consumption needed to resume in Mexico and Argentina , and Peru needed consistent progress towards economic growth , while Colombia &apos;s economy was basically strong though political problems remained .
