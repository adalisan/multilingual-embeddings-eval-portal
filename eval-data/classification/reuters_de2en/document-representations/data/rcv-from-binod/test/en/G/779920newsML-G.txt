Hizbollah fighters on Tuesday carried the coffins of comrades killed in clashes with Israeli forces in a funeral procession attended by several thousand in the south Lebanon town of Nabatiyeh . 
the roar of Israeli planes could be heard overhead as the crowd yelled &quot; Death to Israel ! 
death of America ! 
victory to Islam ! 
five Hizbollah guerrillas were killed on Monday by roadside bombs planted by Israeli commandos after clashes in south Lebanon . 
four were to be buried in their villages near Nabatiyeh . 
a separate funeral was to be held later in the day in Beirut for the fifth . 
four Israeli planes were rocketing Hizbollah targets in the hills of Libbaya-Yohmour in the southeastern Bekaa Valley , north of Israel &apos;s south Lebanon occupation zone , Lebanese security sources said . 
there was no immediate word on casualties in the air assault , the 48th into Lebanon since the beginning of the year . 
earlier , Hizbollah guerrillas fired mortar bombs into the South Lebanon Army outpost of Ahmadiyyeh in the eastern sector of the zone facing the hills , lightly wounding a pro-Israeli militiaman . 
elderly women wailed as a Hizbollah member reported the guerrilla operation over a loud speaker . 
pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas fight Israeli troops and their local militia allies in a bid to oust them from the 15-km ( nine-mile ) wide occupation zone .
