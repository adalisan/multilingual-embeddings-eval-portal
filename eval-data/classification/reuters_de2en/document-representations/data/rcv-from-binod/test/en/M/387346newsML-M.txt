the Baltic Freight Index ( BFI ) rose one point on Wednesday to 1,468 points . 
brokers said that it looked like shaping up to the usual spring season as the grain harvest in various countries appeared to be on schedule and crop forecasts looked good . 
however , some brokers pointed towards the prospect of the Latin American crop being late , as possibly limiting any bullish feeling . 
but generally brokers felt that demand for Atlantic and Pacific Panamaxes and for handies as well , was on the increase . 
one factor that continued to give the market concern , was the ongoing amount of new ships emerging on the market , versus the relative lack of scrapping . 
brokers reported Yukong fixed 54,000 heavy grain US Gulf to Taiwan Mar 1 / 10 was fixed at $ 25.25 , while Halla paid $ 14.50 for the same destination from Nopac . 
on timecharter business , Silver Star 69,402 dwt was taken by Yukong delivery Japan March 5 / 10 for three / five months at $ 12,000 daily .
