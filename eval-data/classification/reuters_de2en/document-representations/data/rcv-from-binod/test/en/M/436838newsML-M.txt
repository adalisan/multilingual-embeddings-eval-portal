1750 GMT - Portuguese shares closed lower , mirroring foreign markets as Wall Street was hit by profit-taking at the opening after its second record close in a row . 
stocks that are most exposed to foreign investors such as Portugal Telecom , Portucel Industrial , Banco Comercial Portugues and Sonae Investimentos closed lower . 
dealers said that the trend tomorrow will depend on foreign bourses and the dollar . 
* PSI20 down 0.35 percent to 6,227.88 
* Dealers said the drop of PT at the close was due to profit taking and the slide of foreign bourses . 
&quot; It could have been profit taking ( in PT shares ) after the strong rise of the stock recently , because I don &apos;t think the explanation lies merely in the fall of other stock exchanges , especially when you consider that PT &apos;s 1996 results were at the top end of expectations , &quot; said one dealer . 
* Dealers noted strong interest in retailer Jeronimo Martins , which rose 30 escudos to 9,180 in volume of 99,301 shares .
