Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday Washington had helped Israel reduce the danger of militant attacks against the Jewish state . 
&quot; I can say that the United States helped us and -- at my request and initiation -- aided us in a meaningful way in order to lessen the danger of terror , &quot; Netanyahu said . 
&quot; The danger of mass terrorist attacks has not passed , &quot; he added . 
he did not elaborate on the kind of help provided by the United States in curbing militant attacks . 
Netanyahu &apos;s comments were excerpted from an interview to appear later on Tuesday on Israel Channel Two television and broadcast on Israel &apos;s army radio . 
on Monday , Israeli media said Netanyahu had sent messages to Syria through the United States and to Iran through Germany demanding they prevent the militant Islamic Jihad group from attacking Israel . 
Netanyahu &apos;s spokesman said he could not comment on the reports . 
Israeli security sources said on Sunday there was information a guerrilla squad was in Israel to avenge the October 26 , 1995 , assassination in Malta of Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shqaqi . 
his killers were not captured and Palestinians blamed Israel . 
the Jewish state went on high alert deploying security forces and setting up roadblocks in crowded areas . 
the measures were eased on Monday but the alert remained . 
Netanyahu , asked if tensions had lessened on Tuesday because there had been arrests or if he could say with certainty that an attack had been foiled , replied : &quot; I don &apos;t think that in this area ( the fight against militants ) anything is certain . 
Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said on Tuesday that the security alert was still in force . 
&quot; The warning was serious and we think that today it is still serious ... This is the principal reason we have still not opened the closure on the ( Arab ) territories , &quot; Mordechai said on army radio . 
Israel on October 23 sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip , barring Palestinians from going to work in the Jewish state , for fear of Islamic Jihad attacks . 
Islamic Jihad and Hamas leaders in areas under Palestinian Authority rule have been in jail since suicide bombings in February and March , responsibility for which was claimed by Hamas , the other leading Islamic resistance group in Palestinian areas . 
those attacks killed 59 people .
