Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah , on the first visit by a senior Saudi official to Lebanon in nearly two decades , stressed his country &apos;s support in seeking the removal of Israeli forces from south Lebanon . 
&quot; We salute the steadfastness of our people and stress our support to their hanging on to their legitimate rights in south Lebanon , &quot; the prince said in a statement distributed as he held a first round of talks with President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri . 
Israel has occupied a 15-km ( nine miles ) -wide strip of land in south Lebanon since 1978 . 
U.N. security council resolution 425 calls for Israel &apos;s unconditional withdrawal from the zone . 
the prince , who did not name Israel in his speech , said peace in the region must be based on firm convictions . 
&quot; We warn that any leniency in seeking peace or any insolence or meddling with peace would cause harm to all parties involved , &quot; he said . 
Lebanon coordinates heavily its peace moves with Damascus . 
Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace talks have been stalled over an Israel refusal to withdraw from occupied Syrian Golan Heights and south Lebanon . 
the prince , accompanied by a large delegation , arrived earlier at the presidential palace east of Beirut after travelling overland from Syria . 
he was met at the border by Hariri and other senior Lebanese officials . 
the visit is the first by a senior Saudi official since Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal came in 1978 in a bid to mediate during Lebanon &apos;s 1975-90 civil war . 
Lebanese officials believe it signals the lifting of an undeclared ban on the travel of top Saudi princes to Lebanon imposed during the civil war , particularly since the mid-1980s when Moslem militiamen sacked the Saudi consulate in Beirut . 
&quot; We are here to congratulate Lebanon for restoring its natural place among its Arab brethren . 
we congratulate it for its political consciousness after the bitter experience it went through and from which it emerged strong , &quot; the prince added . 
diplomats expect Prince Abdullah to hold talks on the Middle East peace process , a controversial economic summit in Qatar which Israel is expected to attend and the reconstruction of Beirut , which was heavily damaged in the civil war .
