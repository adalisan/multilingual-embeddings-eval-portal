the fall in white sugar futures during most of Wednesday was halted in the late afternoon by a rally in New York raws futures . 
at 1700 GMT December was trading at $ 303.90 , down $ 3 a tonne from Tuesday , while other positions were between $ 1.80 and $ 0.10 a tonne lower . 
turnover totalled 4,546 lots . 
earlier a bout of hedge selling ahead of the weekly EU tender , where subsidies for a sizeable tonnage were expected , had narrowed the December / March spread to $ 0.50 a tonne before renewed support developed . 
when news of the EU &apos;s 104,350 tonnes release circulated it had been discounted and traders were watching New York . 
in physicals Tunisia bought one cargo of whites at a scheduled tender but there was no news from Syria where authorities were due to be replying to offers of one cargo of raws and one whites for late Nov / late Dec arrival .
