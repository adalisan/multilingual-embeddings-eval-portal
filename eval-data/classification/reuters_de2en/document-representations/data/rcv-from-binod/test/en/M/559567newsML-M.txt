* European selling takes dollar to lows , where U.S. funds are seen buying . 
* Failure to take US $ 0.7860 in last week &apos;s rally leaves unit open for a downside test 
* RBA Board meets today , no change in rates expected , but market waiting on Governor Macfarlane &apos;s testimony on Thursday . 
the Australian dollar retained a slightly easier bias as concerns over the interest rate outlok remained in the market , although the move had not yet seen the dollar challenge major support . 
with a rally having stalled below US $ 0.7860 last week , traders said the unit could continue to edge lower , although initial support at around US $ 0.7885 / 90 was expected to prove solid on the day . 
the dollar was sold down to its lows in European trading , thinned by a holiday in England , where U.S. funds were seen buying , offering the dollar some support . 
however , the unit was seen remaining range-bound as the market sorted out the interest rate outlook , for which there are a number of key events this week . 
firstly , the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) meets today , although a rate change is not expected . 
in fact , economists see the next likely move as being a rise in early 1998 . 
however , they concede that there is a genuine risk of a cut occuring in the next three months , meaning the market will be watching their screens at 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday -- the first opportunity for the RBA to announce any change . 
further clues to the rate outlook are expected when RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane appears before a parliamentary committee in the Australian equivalent of the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony . 
the RBA has not spoken on the economy since mid-February , and while that outlook was quite bullish , data since then , especially on the labour market , has showed some weakness and revived talk of a rate cut . 
while Macfarlane is before the committee , April labour force data is due . 
the data is expected to show a rise of around 35,000 , but still leaving employment down over the last three months , and the unemployment rate is seen steady at 8.7 percent . 
a weak employment report would keep talk of a rate cut alive , and therefore keep the Australian dollar nervous . 
Australian official interest rates at 6.00 percent are only 50 basis points above U.S. rates . 
with another hike of 25 basis points expected in the U.S. , a local cut would take rates to below those in the U.S , something the market sees as a negative for the dollar . 
the nerves over the rate outlook were also capping the dollar on the cross rates . 
against the yen , the dollar opened at 98.88 / 98 yen from a Monday close of 99.04 / 14 .
