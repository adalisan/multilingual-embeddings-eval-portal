CBOT July soybeans fell further at midsession Friday on pressure from traders exiting positions in July before first notice day Monday , traders said . 
&quot; Everybody &apos;s just rolling out of July , &quot; said one floor trader . 
&quot; Nobody knows what will happen on Monday . 
July was also under pressure from expectations for heavier than expected deliveries against July . 
there is talk that a commercial firm is barging as much as one million bushels of soybeans to Chicago to deliver against futures , traders said . 
as of Thursday , there was only 10,000 bushels of soybeans are registered for delivery . 
soybean basis levels in interior markets have softened this week , so delivery is a more attractive option for some . 
price activity should stay choppy through the session before as traders position before first notice day and the USDA soybean acreage and grain stocks report on Monday , traders said . 
Smith Barney sold 1.5 million bushels November , Iowa grain and ING each sold one million November and Continental grain spread one million November / July , traders said . 
at 1142 CDT , July soybeans were eight cents lower at $ 7 / 92-1 / 2 , and other months were steady to 3-1 / 4 lower .
