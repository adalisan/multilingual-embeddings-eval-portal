around 150 neo-Nazis from Scandinavia , Germany and The Netherlands succeeded in holding a rally in Denmark on Saturday to mark the 10th anniversary of the death of Hitler &apos;s deputy Rudolf Hess . 
shouting &quot; Sieg Heil &quot; and waving swastika flags , they switched their rally at the last moment to this sleepy town west of Copenhagen to avoided a battle with anti-Nazi protesters who fought with police at the original site in nearby Roskilde . 
many of the neo-Nazis wore ski masks and carried wooden shields with portraits of Rudolf Hess . 
they chanted ; &quot; Rudolf Hess -- Fighter For Peace . 
Liberal freedom of speech laws have made Denmark something of a neo-Nazi haven , to the irritation of neighbouring Germany , where Nazi tracts and symbols are banned , and to the discomfort of Danes who remember wartime Nazi occupation . 
Hess hanged himself with an electric cord in Berlin &apos;s Spandau prison on August 17 , 1987 , and the date has become a rallying point for the radical right in Germany and other European countries in recent years . 
some 44 protesters from both sides were arrested during the course of the day , mainly for carrying knives or clubs , police said . 
one anti-Nazi activist was arrested for violence against a police officer . 
two television cameramen , one working for Danish state television and one working for Reuters Television , had their cameras damaged by neo-Nazis . 
the Danish television cameraman was hit over the head with his camera but was not seriously injured . 
Danish neo-Nazi leader Jonny Hansen said the rally had been a success . 
&quot; We changed plans to have a peaceful demo . 
we have had that , so it was a success . 
the neo-Nazis from Denmark , Sweden , Norway , Germany , Finland and The Netherlands marched four km ( 2.5 miles ) to the medieval cobbled square of Koege , led by a lone drummer . 
the Danes carried Danish flags and swastikas . 
they were followed by contingents of Swedish fascists brandishing their version of the national flag , a yellow swastika on a blue background . 
most of the marchers had shaven heads and their leaders wore paramilitary uniforms . 
the Danes wore white shirts , red ties and red swastika armbands . 
the Swedes chose the original Nazi uniform of brown shirts and black caps . 
as Hansen addressed the rally , supporters replied with Sieg Heil chants . 
an English-born member of the far-right Dutch Centre Party 86 , Stewart Mordant , addressed the crowd with an attack on black people . 
&quot; The niggers will try to destroy you . 
your best salvation is to join our struggle . 
beware , we never forget , they &apos;ll never beat the white warriors . 
&quot; he said . 
Townsfolk gathered to watch and shout &quot; Nazi swine . 
&quot; The meeting only lasted about 15 minutes . 
a short distance away in Roskilde , police and a group of about 1,000 anti-Nazi demonstrators clashed when the neo-Nazi marchers failed to arrive there as scheduled . 
protesters threw stones at police , who replied with tear gas . 
there was a second clash later in the day when far-left activists gathered near the neo-Nazi headquarters at Greve , just south of Copenhagen , to confront the returning marchers . 
the protesters threw stones and bottles at police cordoning off the area and the police again responded with tear gas .
