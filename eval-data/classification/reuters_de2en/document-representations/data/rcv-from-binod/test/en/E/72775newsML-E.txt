a set of closely watched indicators released on Tuesday showed Japan &apos;s economy recovering in July , albeit slowly , despite lingering concerns over a weak consumer appetite for goods and services . 
the government &apos;s Economic Planning Agency ( EPA ) announced that the diffusion index of leading economic indicators remained above the &quot; boom or bust &quot; 50 percent line in July for a fourth consecutive month . 
the index of leading indicators stood at 77.8 on a scale of 100 for the month . 
a figure above 50 is taken as suggesting the economy will expand in the coming months . 
the agency said in a statement that the data confirmed that the economy was continuing to recover . 
the coincident index measuring economic conditions current in July , stood at 80.0 after June &apos;s 54.5 , while the the lagging index , which traces economic trends in the previous few months , was at 28.6 , down from 37.5 the previous month . 
the coincident index was above 50 for a second month in a row , while that of lagging indicators was below 50 for a fourth month . 
&quot; Since both ( leading and coincident ) indices were above 50 percent . 
we can translate this as meaning that the economy is still recovering , &quot; Kunji Okue , an economist at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo , told Reuters Financial Television . 
the Bank of Japan echoed the view , saying in its monthly economic report released on Tuesday that companies were increasing investment in fresh plant and equipment while personal consumption showed a moderate recovery trend . 
&quot; Current economic situations have not offered us factors which would make the Bank of Japan consider a change in its assessment of the gradual pace of the recovery , &quot; a senior Bank of Japan official told reporters on Tuesday . 
the bank said in the report that housing starts remained at a high level as individuals took advantage of low interest rates and also built houses before a planned rise in Japan &apos;s consumption tax to five percent from three percent in April . 
&quot; Overall , private capital spending is strong and housing investments are doing okay . 
the missing component is private consumption , &quot; said Yasushi Okuda , a BZW Securities economist . 
Okuda said that the O-157 food poisoning epidemic which swept Japan in July and August was likely to have affected consumption , adding that department and chainstore sales coming out later this week would be interesting to watch out for . 
last week , the government announced that Japan &apos;s household spending fell a real 4.4 percent year-on-year in July , the biggest monthly drop since February 1981 . 
the decline came as households cut back on purchases of fresh foods and on eating out because of the epidemic , which has killed 11 people and made more than 9,500 ill this year . 
despite this , the government made it clear it would not come up with additional fiscal spending this year for the sake of the economy . 
four years of heavy government spending aimed at stimulating the economy has made Japan &apos;s budgetary deficit one of the worst among major industrialised nations . 
&quot; judging from indicators showing economic trends up to now , I believe we still need to be cautious about drafting a large-scale supplementary budget as a way to stimulate the economy , &quot; Finance Minister Wataru Kubo told reporters before the data was released .
