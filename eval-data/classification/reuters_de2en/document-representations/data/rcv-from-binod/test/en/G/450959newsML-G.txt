Lebanese , Palestinian Moslem and leftist groups protested on Tuesday against the arrest of five Red Army guerrillas and urged the government to immediately release one of them . 
the groups , which organised a sit-in in a Beirut suburb , included the pro-Iranian Hizbollah , the Progressive Socialist Party which has two cabinet ministers , the Communist Party and the Islamic Gamaa ( Islamic grouping ) . 
also represented were the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) , the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine - General Command ( PFLP-GC ) and Fatah Movement - Revolutionary Council . 
all are opposed to Arab-Israeli peace plans . 
&quot; Kozo Okamoto and his comrades are friends of the Arabs and the Palestinians . 
they are honest militants who contributed to the just struggle of Palestinian and Arab people , &quot; a statement by the 15 Moslem and leftist groups said . 
Okamoto and four other guerrillas , arrested in Lebanon on February 15 , were charged 11 days ago with passport forgery and other offences carrying up to 10 years in jail . 
Okamoto was involved in the May 1972 shootout at Tel Aviv &apos;s Lod airport in which 24 people died and 100 were injured . 
he was captured by Israeli forces and sentenced to life imprisonment but was released in a PFLP-GC and Israeli prisoner swap in May , 1985 . 
the other members of the Japanese group are Masao Adachi , Kazua Tohira , Haruo Wako and Mariko Yamamoto . 
&quot; We demand the government and high officials to release him ( Okamoto ) immediately and to drop any political , security and judicial charges against him and to give him all necessary natural and legal conditions for accomodation in the country or even grant him asylum , &quot; the statement added . 
the sit-in was held at a Hizbollah ( Party of God ) press centre in the southern suburbs of Beirut . 
Lebanese and Palestinian Moslem guerrillas fight Israeli troops occupying a 15-km ( nine miles ) -wide south Lebanon buffer zone .
