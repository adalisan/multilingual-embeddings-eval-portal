Yugoslavia is unlikely to achieve its recently announced $ 2.5 billion export target for 1996 , economists said on Wednesday . 
&quot; It is clear from the January-September trend of exports , imports , trade gap and industrial output that total 1996 export value will not overshoot $ 1.7 billion , &quot; Zivojin Jevtic of the Foreign Trade Institute told Reuters . 
&quot; It would be a miracle to reach this forecast . 
it means exports would almost double in the remaining three months of 1996 , &quot; he said , adding that 1996 imports could total $ 3 billion . 
head of the Yugoslav Statistical Office Milovan Zivkovic estimated earlier that 1996 exports could easily reach $ 2.5 billion . 
according to official statistics , January-September exports stood at $ 1.259 billion and imports at $ 2.655 billion . 
economists disagreed with this estimate , saying both exports and imports growth rates were slowing down . 
Milojko Arsic of the independent CesMecon Centre for Economic Studies said it was highly unlikely that the official target would be achieved even if monthly exports were to rise to $ 200 million during the last quarter . 
&quot; Exports , imports and trade gap targets are not realistic . 
even if Yugoslavia completes its part in a barter deal with China , exports would hardly reach $ 1.8 billion , &quot; he said . 
speaking of the huge trade gap of more than one billion dollars , Arsic said trade deficit was a constant feature of Serbian economy . 
&quot; The deficit is not a consequence of an economic policy but a result of the structure of Serbia &apos;s economy , &quot; he said , adding that even in times of better economic conditions and good trade relations with the European Union and some Arab countries , Serbia ran huge trade deficits . 
Arsic cautioned statistics was incomplete because companies hid true value of their export activity . 
&quot; There is probably a surplus in services , mainly coming from our construction industry in Russia . 
those firms normally do not report their full income , &quot; he added . 
according to CesMecon &apos;s latest studies , Yugoslavia &apos;s 1996 foreign trade would account for about 20 percent of the country &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) . 
government aims to see exports generating 50 percent of GDP might be realised in seven or eight years , economists said . 
but they agreed any sizeable exports growth depended on sweeping , radical reforms and privatisation . 
any delay in privatisation would have ill-effects , putting brakes on long-term economic performance . 
Arsic said it was realistic for Yugoslavia to maintain relatively high growth rates over next two or three years . 
&quot; But to speak of true growth is somewhat misleading . 
the country &apos;s economy is only recovering from a low initial level . 
he cautioned that current growth only meant an increase in utilisation of capacities and labour . 
&quot; There is nothing to boast of . 
we are only trying to get back where we were in 1989 , 1990 . 
&quot; We could expect 5-6 percent growth rates over next two to three years even without reform , major cuts in fiscal burden and change in economic policy . 
but only a reform would attract foreign capital needed for real expansion of economy .
