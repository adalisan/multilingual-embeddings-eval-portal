a rightist Turkish leader with a key position in parliament said he would back Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan &apos;s plans to resign and form a caretaker government to take the country to early elections . 
&quot; We will say &apos; yes &apos; to this alternative so as to put the ballot box in front of the nation . 
we will support it because we want stability in Turkey , &quot; Anatolian news agency quoted far-right leader Mushin Yazicioglu as saying late on Monday . 
Erbakan , modern Turkey &apos;s first Islamist leader , is expected to swap jobs with his coalition partner , Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller , this week in a deal to call snap polls . 
but the government is short of the majority it needs to get the power transfer and any election legislation through parliament . 
the coalition has 274 deputies in the 550-seat assembly . 
Yazicioglu &apos;s Grand Unity Party has eight MPs . 
President Suleyman Demirel , an avowed secularist , must also approve the power handover but he has not given any indications if he will allow the plan to go ahead .
