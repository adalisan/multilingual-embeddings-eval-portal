Papua New Guinea Governor General Sir Wiwa Korowi appealed on Wednesday for soldiers to return to barracks and for people not to take to the streets and &quot; destroy the nation &quot; as PNG &apos;s political crisis intensified . 
the appeal for calm came as local media reported that Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan would conduct a cabinet meeting by telephone later on Wednesday . 
there was speculation cabinet would put more pressure on Chan and two other ministers to step down over the hiring of mercenaries to help fight rebels on Bougainville island . 
&quot; Let us not take to the streets to destroy the nation , &quot; Korowi said in a national radio address . 
Chan has not been seen in public since Tuesday evening after he survived a parliamentary motion calling him to stand aside pending an inquiry into the hiring of the mercenaries . 
about 80 heavily armed soldiers and thousands of anti-government protestors beseiged the parliament building overnight preventing politicans from leaving . 
however , Chan as well as Deputy Prime Minister Chris Haiveta and Defence Minister Mathias Ijape were whisked away by police immediately after the vote . 
there were rumours that Chan had fled the country but this could not be confirmed . 
on Wednesday morning , about 150 protesters and about two dozen soldiers were sitting outside the parliament house entrances but there was no sign of trouble . 
shops , banks and other businesses which were closed on Tuesday amid the political upheaval were reopening on Wednesday and public transport was returning to normal . 
Korowi , who earlier this week called on Chan to step down , said he understood that many people felt frustrated and wanted to take to the streets to burn cars , damage property and fight but the cost was too high . 
&quot; No matter what amount of evil we think they have committed , your confrontation directly with the parliament and its members will not help and I appeal to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force as your commander in chief to move back to barracks this morning , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What you have done overnight by holding the members of parliament under siege is dangerous , now get back to your barracks , &quot; he said . 
Korowi also appealed for sacked army commander , Jerry Singirok , to hand over control of the defence force to the new commander , Colonel Jack Tuat . 
he called on Singirok to &quot; hand over graciously command of the defence forces &quot; . 
Korowi is the highest political figure in the country . 
although his role as the representative of Britain &apos;s Queen Elizabeth , the country &apos;s titular head of state , is largely ceremonial he carries considerable moral authority . 
Sir Michael Somare , a leading opposition figure and this impoverished South Pacific nation &apos;s first leader , earlier told a delegation of protest leaders that a fresh motion to urge Chan to stand down would be moved in parliament on Wednesday . 
Somare said the protests could reverse Tuesday &apos;s vote of 58-39 in favour of Chan . 
&quot; I would like to give you this assurance , that we are going to retry the motion again , &quot; Somare told protest leaders outside parliament , under the watchful gaze of heavily armed soldiers . 
Somare told Reuters the protests may sway members to switch support from Chan . 
the motion is not binding , but Chan &apos;s opponents hope a win would shame him into quitting . 
Chan himself took the floor only once in the rowdy five-hour debate , saying he had hired the mercenaries to prevent more Papua New Guinea soldiers dying on Bougainville . 
rebel army leader Major Walter Enuma arrived at parliament late on Tuesday to calm angry troops and to reassure politicians that they were safe . 
&quot; We accept the decision of the floor of the parliament and we will allow the normal democratic process to go on , whether it was in favour of what we were fighting for or not , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Enuma , who wore a sidearm in his meeting with the politicians , said the parliamentarians should stay for their own safety . 
&quot; For their own safety , they should stay in , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There will be no confrontation . 
the crisis began 10 days ago when army chief Singirok demanded the mercenary contract be terminated and that Chan , Haiveta and Ijape resign . 
Singirok was promptly sacked but appears to remain in control of the army .
