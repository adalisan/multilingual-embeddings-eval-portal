Bangladesh , India , Nepal and Bhutan have finalised preparations for a new trade bloc aimed at closer economic cooperation , the Bangladesh government said . 
the four-nation body , called Growth Quadrangle , has already set its objectives , the announcement said late on Sunday . 
senior diplomats of the four countries , at a meeting in Kathmandu on April 2 , agreed on a seven-point plan and principles to govern economic cooperation among the member states . 
the bloc had been originally planned as a sub-group of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) but developed as a separate grouping in the face of strong opposition from Pakistan . 
the SAARC , launched in 1985 , groups Bangladesh , Bhutan , India , Maldives , Nepal , Pakistan and Sri Lanka . 
but it has since remained largely ineffective because of rivalry between India and Pakistan , Dhaka officials said . 
the officials said the Growth Quadrangle was aimed at creating an &quot; enabling environment for rapid economic development through identification and implementation of specific projects in the core economic sector &quot; . 
transport , energy , trade and investment facilitation , tourism and the best use of national resources are among the areas identified for cooperation , the announcement said . 
&quot; It ( the grouping ) will constitute an additionality to and not be a substitute for bilateral , regional and multilateral cooperation , &quot; it said . 
the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) has opposed the quandrangle , saying that the move was an Indian design to extend its hegemony in the region .
