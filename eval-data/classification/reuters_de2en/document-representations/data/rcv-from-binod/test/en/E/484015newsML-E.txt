fear that rising liquidity in the Nigerian monetary system is about to stoke inflation is giving the authorities jitters . 
the first sign of trouble surfaced in a report just released by the federal office of statistics showing a 1.1 percent increase in year-on-year inflation to 26.7 percent in January this year from 25.6 percent in December . 
the government has set a target for annual consumer price inflation of 15 percent in 1997 , compared with 28 percent in 1996 . 
tight control on public spending by the military government has reduced it from a recent peak above 80 percent . 
&quot; The federal office of statistics report is worrying , &quot; said a senior central bank official on Thursday . 
&quot; The high liquidity in the system is the main reason why it has been decided that the transfer of the accounts of parastatals to commercial banks will have to wait for a while . 
Parastatals are government companies and under a new dispensation unveiled in the 1997 fiscal budget in January , they were supposed to move their bank accounts to commercial banks to free the central bank from retail banking . 
when it was announced the measure was widely hailed as part of the government &apos;s policy of gradual deregulation to strengthen the private sector . 
now it is being seen as having an unhealthy effect on the monetary system . 
&quot; The government is probably right to delay it because already there is too much money in circulation and this is not very good for the economy , &quot; said banker Ogie Idago . 
the central bank has not supplied any figures of just how much money there is in circulation but economists say a recent injection of 30 billion naira ( $ 350 million ) from the Petroleum Trust Fund , set up to disburse money accruing from a four-fold increase in pump prices in 1994 , had sharply increased liquidity . 
the current problem stems from a deliberate policy to reflate the economy to achieve a growth target of 5.5 percent in gross domestic product in 1997 compared with only 3.25 percent last year . 
given reduced inflow of foreign investments because of Nigeria &apos;s political crisis and delay in embracing privatisation of state enterprises , the oil-rich nation opted in the 1997 budget for higher public spending to stimulate economic growth . 
a budget surplus of 37 billion naira from 1996 , saved largely from squeezing the system dry last year , is being ploughed back into the system just as government is also repaying billions of naira of state domestic debts . 
many fear this will erode the economic gains of the last two years which stabilised the naira exchange rate for a long time until last month &apos;s 5.88 percent devaluation . 
that devaluation to 85 naira to the U.S. dollar from 80 was itself blamed by the central bank on too much money in circulation which led to huge demand for foreign exchange at the weekly auction . 
since the devaluation , demand at the foreign exchange auction has fallen by more than 30 percent while demand has risen at the weekly auction of treasury bills , used up to mop up money in circulation . 
Central bank officials said the sale of treasury bills will be stepped up in the next few weeks . 
&quot; The aim is to drain the market of idle funds as much as possible to keep to the inflation target , &quot; said one . 
the target is to bring inflation down to around 15 percent by year-end . 
however , not everyone agrees that an increase in inflation will necessarily derail the economic programme . 
&quot; A certain amount of inflation would often accompany any economy reflation programme , &quot; argued the independent Guardian newspaper in its editorial comment on Thursday . 
&quot; The most important consideration , therefore , is not the fear of a possible re-awakening of inflation ; rather it is to make sure that growth is strong enough to effectively vitiate the more deleterious effects of rising prices , &quot; it added . 
Nigeria , however , remains mired in political crisis that has affected everything including the economy since 1993 when the army annulled a presidential poll aimed at restoring democracy . 
general Sani Abacha &apos;s government is implementing a programme to hand over to a democratically-elected president , which kicked off with local council polls last month . 
but fears persist that he intends to turn himself into a civilian president next year .
