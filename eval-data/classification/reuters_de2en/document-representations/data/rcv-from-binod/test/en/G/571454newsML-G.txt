an off-duty policeman was shot dead in a bar near Belfast &apos;s city centre in an attack which bore the hallmarks of a guerrilla killing , Northern Ireland police said on Saturday . 
the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) said two armed men entered the Parliament Bar late on Friday and singled out the man , firing a number of shots . 
&quot; We can confirm that the deceased was an off-duty police officer , &quot; a Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) spokesman said . 
a senior police officer at the scene said earlier the attack looked like the work of guerrillas but declined to speculate which group was responsible . 
the last known attack in Northern Ireland by the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) was on April 10 , when IRA guerrillas shot and wounded a policewoman . 
the IRA is fighting to end British rule of Northern Ireland and reunite the province with the Irish Republic . 
police say there have also been a number of attacks on Catholics in recent months by suspected &quot; Loyalist &quot; guerrillas , who want Northern Ireland to stay British .
