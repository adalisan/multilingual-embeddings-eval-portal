* speculators trying to find out if rumours of big buy order beneath $ 0.7605 are true , if not will see $ 0.7585 pressed 
* April housing finance data today should show healthy rise 
analysts still saw a chance of a break higher as long as US $ 0.7585 support held intact and looked for a short squeeze of anything up to a cent if US $ 0.7630 could be overcome . 
traders were more cautious given the weight of interest cost an A $ holder had to carry these days -- perversely the cost of A $ forwards may be encouraging exporters to take cover now in the spot market -- but added stops were building atop US $ 0.7665 and US $ 0.7685 which would keep a rally rolling if triggered . 
on the crosses the currency was under pressure from a revived yen , slipping to 85.17 / 27 yen from 85.95 / 05 late here Tuesday . 
the move mirrored a fall in US $ / yen as the market took a defensive stance in case Japanese trade data out this morning showed the April surplus was even higher than feared . 
median forecasts are for a current account surplus of 1.1 trillion yen against 1.03 trillion in March and anything more would stir concerns about renewed trade friction between Japan and the U.S. 
domestic data on housing finance should prove better reading for A $ bulls with private banking pointing to a healthy rise . 
median forecasts favour mortgages rising 12 percent in April after a 1.3 percent dip in March . 
economists will be looking for a pickup in commitments for construction which would bode well for a continued recovery in the housing market . 
also out is the Westpac consumer sentiment index for June which analysts reckon is due a bounce after May &apos;s 2.8 percent fall . 
the survey would also have been taken in the warm glow of the May 23 rate cut which saw mortgage levels to 20-year lows . 
one bearish factor was a 2.18 point drop in the commodity Research Bureau index , although base metals were actually up on the day .
