strikes at giant General Motors Corp. sapped industrial production in October , the Federal Reserve said on Friday , causing the first broad-based decline in national output in seven months . 
analysts said the slowdown in manufacturing , along with a Commerce Department report showing rising stocks of unsold goods in September , pointed to a sluggish start for the fourth quarter that pointed to a continuing slowdown in the economy . 
the Fed said output at the nation &apos;s factories , mines and utilities dropped a surprisingly steep 0.5 percent last month after rising a revised 0.3 percent in September -- the first monthly decline since a 0.5 percent drop last March . 
&quot; sharp drops in the production of motor vehicles and in the output of related parts and materials accounted for the decrease in the overall index , &quot; the central bank said . 
GM workers struck first in Canada and then later in the United States , closing some plants becasue of parts shortages . 
the strike has since been settled . 
separately , the Commerce Department said business inventories rose 0.1 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted $ 1 trillion after growing a revised 0.3 percent in August . 
the rise in inventories was notable because it was concentrated at the retail and manufacturing levels and followed a report on Wednesday that retail stores boosted sales in October by a meagre 0.2 percent . 
it renewed questions about whether the vital holiday sales season will be as robust as hoped for since consumers seem wary about spending despite solid job prospects , growing incomes and a rising stock market . 
&quot; It &apos;s becoming crucial whether we have a satisfactory sales season through the holidays because , if we don &apos;t , we may see production cuts being sustained and eventually employment being curbed , &quot; said Robert Dederick , an economic consultant to Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . 
during October , the Fed said the rate of auto assemblies fell to 5.5 million a year from 6.5 million in September , though light-truck assemblies held steady at a 5.4 million . 
businesses ran at just 82.7 percent of maximum capacity in October , down from a revised 83.4 percent in September . 
it was the lowest rate since 82.6 percent in March . 
the drop in output was the first since last March , when it fell 0.9 percent . 
David Orr , an economist with First Union Corp. in Charlotte , N.C. , noted that nine of the 20 manufacturing industry groups cut production last month in a widespread response to soft retail sales . 
&quot; It looks like a fairly normal mini-cycle inventory adjustment that should not be too worrisome in any cosmic sense , but one that will keep the Fed on the sidelines , &quot; Orr said . 
fed policy-makers on Wednesday held interest rates steady and were expected to do the same at their final meeting of the year on Dec . 17 . 
output at mines and utilities was also weak last month . 
output from mines fell 1 percent after a 0.1 percent decline in September , while utilities , which were forecast to boost output , were flat after rising 0.3 percent in September . 
Gordon Richards , an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers , said inventories of unsold goods had swollen by about $ 30 billion over the summer and production will be scaled back until they are pulled down . 
&quot; In essence , industry is waiting for consumer demand to revive , &quot; he said . 
there were reasons for optimism about a bounceback in spending . 
the University of Michigan &apos;s preliminary index of consumer sentiment for November jumped to 98.9 from 96.5 in October , financial market sources said Friday . 
the full findings are issued only to paying customers . 
in addition , the Fed noted that , excluding motor vehicles , business equipment production rose a sturdy 0.7 percent last month , led by another sharp increase in computer output . 
previously , the Fed said industrial production rose only 0.2 percent in September but revised that upwards . 
it had said capacity use was at 83.3 percent in September and also raised that fractionally .
