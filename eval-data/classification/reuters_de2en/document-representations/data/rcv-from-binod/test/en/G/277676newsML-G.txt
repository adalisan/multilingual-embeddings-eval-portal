Russian President Boris Yeltsin expects Chinese President Jiang Zemin to visit Moscow in April for a summit that will set the seal on a new level of relations between the two giant states , the Kremlin said on Friday . 
the visit was agreed during a 50-minute meeting between Yeltsin and Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng , the Russian president &apos;s first with a foreign official since returning to work this week after a heart bypass operation on November 5 . 
&quot; I am very pleased with the course of events , &quot; a thinner but apparently healthier Yeltsin told officials in brief remarks broadcast on Russian television . 
Li later met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . 
the two government leaders agreed to meet each other twice a year to monitor progress on building up trade and diplomatic relations and signed a number of deals ranging from the supply of Russian warplanes and building a nuclear power station in China to an accord between the two countries &apos; central banks . 
&quot; We laid a good foundation for the next century and the next millennium , &quot; Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying . 
Moscow and Beijing , once giant rivals for leadership of the communist world , have been building steadily warmer and closer ties since Soviet communism began to unravel a decade ago . 
for Russia , democracy has been accompanied by poverty and Moscow sees China as a huge market for its struggling industry . 
&quot; We have the desire and the possibility to work , two great states have huge potential for cooperation in every field , &quot; Ria news agency quoted Chernomyrdin saying . 
&quot; Our task is to make use of these possibilities , which we want to do and will do . 
Li was quoted as saying that his twice-yearly meetings with Chernomyrdin would &quot; promote trade , economic and technical cooperation between our two countries &quot; . 
the government meetings put Sino-Russian relations on the same level as Moscow has with the United States and France . 
Kremlin press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing Yeltsin and Jiang , together with presidents of the former Soviet republics of Tajikistan , Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan would sign an accord in April reducing forces on their borders . 
&quot; Boris Nikolayevich stated that relations between Russia and China have reached a new level , &quot; the spokesman said . 
China and the former Soviet Union clashed along their border in the 1960s when the two nuclear powers were at odds . 
disputes over border demarcation were for the most part resolved in 1991 and Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin , who visited China last April , had promised to finalise the issue next year . 
Russia &apos;s desire to develop close links with China has followed NATO &apos;s plans to expand eastwards by admitting Moscow &apos;s Cold War allies in Eastern Europe as members of the alliance . 
Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin and Li had agreed that the future political map of the globe should be &quot; a multi-pole world which is not divided into leaders and those who are being led &quot; . 
Yeltsin has said more than once that he seeks a strategic partnership between Russia and China . 
but he has ruled out a revival of the close political and military alliance that had existed between Moscow and Beijing in 1950s . 
Interfax quoted Li as saying he hoped to see bilateral annual trade at $ 8 to $ 10 billion next year and to push it to $ 20 billion by the end of the decade . 
trade was $ 6.38 billion in the first nine months of this year . 
he also said China would support Russia &apos;s bid to join the Asia-Pacific region &apos;s APEC economic cooperation body . 
Russian Defence Industry Minister Zinovy Pak told Interfax the two delegations signed a deal on Friday on the supply of Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets to China . 
he gave no details .
