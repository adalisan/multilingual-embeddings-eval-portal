U.S. Gulf conventional gasoline differentials shed more strength in Friday afternoon trade as buyers who drove the market up higher this morning temporarily ran out of steam . 
new York Harbor and Midcontinent gasoline differentials continued at higher levels in sympathy with Houston strength , while distillates showed mixed results in U.S. markets . 
USG prompt &quot; M1 &quot; grade unleaded , whose diffs had swelled by as much as 1.25 cents a gallon Friday morning ahead of a scheduling deadline for shipping product on the Houston-to-New York colonial Pipleline , had retraced a full penny by early afternoon trade , players said . 
&quot; gasoline is coming off . 
everyone just ran out of steam since they &apos;ve been trying hard all day to bring the market up . 
they will come back in though at the last minute , &quot; said one Gulf trader . 
in afternoon trade , an &quot; M1 &quot; parcel sold for 1.00 cent and 0.75 cent over August NYMEX , compared with the 2.0-cent-over deals done earlier in the day . 
an any-month &quot; M1 &quot; parcel was heard sold for 1.25 cents under the August print . 
besides colonial Pipeline scheduling , the reasons behind Friday &apos;s differential rally were not entirely clear . 
but many players said two major trading houses were either forced to cover commitments or were attempting to drive prices higher to help a paper market position . 
&quot; I don &apos;t know whether they were short and chose not to cover or they were purposely shorting and driving the market higher because of what they had on the swap side , &quot; said a Gulf gasoline trader . 
other Gulf players said the fact traders were outnumbering refiners as buyers Friday morning buttressed talk that someone was trying to bullishly influence the market for a swap position . 
another backdrop to gasoline &apos;s strength was the outage due to a fire at a Mobil Corp hydrocracker at its Chalmette , Louisiana refinery , but traders cautioned that the crippling of the unit was not enough to singlehandedly move the market . 
prompt reformulated A2 gasoline remained firm , with barrels talked at 1.00 cent over the August NYMEX , up about 0.25 cent on the day . 
regular conventional M2 gasoline floated near Thursday &apos;s levels , as buyers for prompt barrels received no relief from sellers . 
&quot; I think the nearby barrels remain a little tight , &quot; one player said . 
prompt M1 changed hands as low at 1.85 cents under the August NYMEX earlier in the day , though offers firmed to about -1.65 cents under by mid-afternoon .
