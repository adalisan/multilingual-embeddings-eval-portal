U.S. Deputy Defence Secretary John White said on Monday he was satisfied with the progress of investigations into a June bombing that killed 19 American airmen near Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia . 
&quot; We have quite close cooperation with the Saudi government in respect to the Dhahran blast investigations and we think it is going very well , &quot; he told reporters before leaving Doha after a brief visit . 
the servicemen were killed when a fuel truck blew up at a complex housing U.S. military personnel in the city of Khobar , near Dhahran . 
Saudi Arabia has yet to reveal the results of its investigation into the blast . 
in November 1995 , seven people including five Americans were killed in a bombing at a U.S.-run military training centre in Riyadh . 
four Saudis were beheaded for carrying out the attack . 
Washington has repeatedly said Saudi authorities had not yet provided evidence the United States wants in its investigation of the Khobar bombing . 
in January FBI Director Louis Freeh criticised the kingdom for frustrating U.S. efforts to determine responsbility for the attack . 
White , who visited Saudi Arabia on Sunday , said he discussed the progress of investigations with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah . 
&quot; They ( the Saudis ) are continuing with the investigations and we are cooperating with them and I think should not comment on it . 
but obviously from their point of view and our point of view the people who perpetrated this act of terrorism should be brought to justice soon , &quot; White said . 
about 5,700 U.S. troops are stationed in the kingdom as part of coalition forces policing a no-fly zone over southern Iraq . 
White , who left Qatar for Bahrain as part of a tour of the region , said U.S. policy towards the Gulf would remain unchanged , despite a change of the guard at the Pentagon . 
during his visit , White met with Qatar &apos;s Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani and inspected operations of the U.S. Airpower expeditionary Force &apos;s 30 planes , deployed in Qatar until May 20 to fly sorties in support of Operation Southern watch over Iraq .
