CSCE cocoa prices tumbled to new life-of-contract lows on Tuesday as speculators sold heavily amid a gloomy technical picture and the perception of ample near-term supply , traders said . 
Most-active May fell $ 21 a tonne on the day , to $ 1,282 , just off a fresh low of $ 1,281 . 
the day &apos;s high was $ 1,299 . 
spot March contract ended $ 23 lower , at $ 1,244 , a near 11-month low on the weekly chart , while the outer months finished down $ 16 to $ 23 . 
the market headed lower at the outset , as a weak performance in the London cocoa market weighed on sentiment . 
dealers said downward momentum accelerated after May delivery breached key chart support at $ 1,291 . 
technically , traders pegged near-term May support at $ 1,275 , while resistance was seen near $ 1,299- $ 1,303 . 
&quot; everyday it just works lower , &quot; one trader said . 
on the fundamental side , traders said a pick-up in Ivorian arrivals during January , which could signal a larger-than-expected 1996 / 97 harvest , and a perception of plentiful supplies in the short-term will to continue to pressure the market . 
&quot; The bottom line is , there is plenty of cocoa to be found if you want to buy cocoa , &quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walt Spilka . 
active spread trading ahead of the spot contract &apos;s first notice day Friday accounted for much of the day &apos;s volume , which came in at an estimated 11,547 lots , up from Monday &apos;s official tally of 8,630 lots .
