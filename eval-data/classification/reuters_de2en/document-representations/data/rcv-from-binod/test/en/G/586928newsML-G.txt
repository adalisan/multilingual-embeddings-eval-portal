the European Parliament on Thursday urged European Union governments to adopt a more consistent policy towards Iran , which it accused of &quot; persistent acts of state terrorism &quot; . 
the EU withdrew its ambassadors from Tehran in April -- when a German court ruled that Iran &apos;s rulers had ordered political assassinations in Europe -- only to decide less than three weeks later to allow the envoys to return . 
&quot; The European Parliament demands that the Council ( of EU Ministers ) establish a common and united policy ... regarding the diplomatic representation of the member states in Iran , &quot; Euro-deputies said in a non-binding resolution . 
the EU &apos;s directly elected assembly also urged the 15-member Union to step up pressure on the Tehran authorities to stop sponsoring terrorism and human rights violations , and to increase EU ties with pro-democracy groups in the country . 
at the same time , the assembly made clear its &quot; profound sympathy &quot; for the victims of this week &apos;s earthquake disaster in Iran and demanded immediate EU aid for those affected . 
the parliament reiterated its condemnation of the death sentence which Iran &apos;s religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued eight years ago against author Salman Rushdie for alleged blasphemy in his novel &quot; The satanic verses . 
Rushdie on May 6 condemned as &quot; contemptible &quot; the EU &apos;s decision to allow its ambassadors to return to Tehran despite a German court finding that Iran &apos;s political leaders had ordered the killings of a group of Iranian Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 . 
I was very surprised that after the ... trial actually convicted the Iranian leadership of terrorism in a German court that ... after token gestures nothing was done , &quot; Rushdie told CNN television in an interview . 
&quot; It is pretty contemptible that Europe was unable to respond to the proof that terrorism had taken place on European soil . 
if people are trying to construct an idea of Europe which we all want to belong to , they can &apos;t do so if they don &apos;t take into account these human rights aspects .
