the Canadian Football League began searching for a new leader on Wednesday after CFL commissioner Larry Smith resigned following a chaotic , money-losing season . 
Smith , 45 , said he will not seek a second term as commissioner when his five-year contract expires on April 1 , 1997 . 
&quot; I am proud to have had the opportunity to work with the CFL , but feel it &apos;s time that someone with new ideas and energy be given the opportunity of taking this league into the next millennium , &quot; Smith said in a statement released by the league . 
his departure comes as many fans wonder if the embattled league will survive at all . 
despite an exciting Grey Cup championship game won by the Toronto Argonauts last month , the CFL is dripping red ink . 
all but one of its nine clubs lost money this year , due to small crowds and cash bailouts to keep teams in Ottawa , Montreal and Vancouver afloat during the 1996 season . 
the 120-year-old Ottawa rough riders franchise folded last month at the end of the regular season . 
the future is also cloudy for the Montreal Alouettes -- who won the Grey Cup last year as the Baltimore Stallions , but lured few fans this season . 
the Vancouver-based British Columbia Lions are also in receivership . 
Smith , a former running back with the Alouettes , was hired with much fanfare in 1992 after serving as an executive with a Canadian food company . 
observers said at the time that the struggling league desperately needed a solid businessman at the helm . 
but five years later , the league &apos;s survival is still in doubt . 
his most ambitious plan was an ill-fated expansion into the United States which lasted only three seasons . 
Canadian-style football failed to catch on in cities like Sacramento , San Antonio , Memphis , Las Vegas and Birmingham . 
it drew decent crowds and became the first American team to win the Grey Cup championship in 1995 . 
but the Stallions were forced to move to Montreal when the National Football League returned to Baltimore this year . 
although Smith &apos;s expansion dream was sharply criticised by CFL purists , his supporters argued the league would have collapsed without the millions of dollars in expansion fees from U.S. teams . 
Smith said he will devote the rest of his mandate to implement a cost-cutting plan to save the league . 
under the plan , all clubs have until January to secure enough season-ticket sales to operate next year .
