Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali lamented on Tuesday what he said was a shrinking interest in international news , saying the average citizen &apos;s knowledge of serious world affairs had diminished . 
&quot; There are far fewer &apos; foreign correspondents &apos; or overseas news bureaux . 
editors and publishers say they cannot afford them . 
they say the public just isn &apos;t very interested in what &apos;s happening elsewhere in the world . 
addressing a lunch given by U.N. correspondents , he said that , while there was still a lot of international news , all too often it featured &quot; only the most dramatic -- or the most horrible -- events , &quot; which could still arouse great interest and inflame emotions . 
&quot; But with the decline in sustained interest in international news , these big events lack context . 
without continuous coverage of an issue or a geographic area , big news that suddenly bursts into the media is extremely hard to judge or to comprehend . 
&quot; As a result , public opinion can become public pressure for action that is not well founded , &quot; he said , without citing specific examples . 
&quot; And then , just as suddenly as it came , the story is gone , &quot; said Boutros-Ghali , whose re-election for a second five-year term is opposed by the United States . 
the &quot; marvellous global television networks &quot; could serve to counteract this trend , he said . 
&quot; But often they are the means not of carrying solid news of international affairs in a comprehensive way , but of transmitting material about the developed world to the developing world rather than the other way around . 
the United Nations was affected since , although located in what was perhaps the media capital of the world , &quot; we face a daily struggle to ensure that our message is heard and reported fairly and accurately , &quot; Boutros-Ghali said . 
&quot; As journalists , you face a daily struggle to ensure that serious copy is used and that coverage is not dominated by trivia and merely entertaining material , &quot; he told his audience . 
&quot; Unfortunately , this is a struggle we both appear to be losing , &quot; he said , and it could only have a negative impact on diplomacy and international relations .
