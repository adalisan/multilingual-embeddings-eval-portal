national Cancer Institute advisers on Thursday formally recommended that women in their 40s get mammograms every year or two if they are at average risk for breast cancer . 
the National Cancer Advisory Board made the unequivocal recommendation after years of increasingly acrimonious debate about the the value of mammograms for women under age 50 . 
Dr Richard Klausner , director of the National Cancer Institute , has said he would follow the board &apos;s advice . 
there has been no controversy about whether mammograms have life-saving benefits for women over age 50 and the advisory board repeated its recommendation that women over that age should have mammograms every one to two years . 
the advisory board said women who are at higher risk for breast cancer should seek medical advice about whether they should have mammograms before they turn 40 and about how often they should have the tests in their 40s . 
until 1993 , the NCI did recommend regular breast X-rays for women in their 40s , but dropped the recommendation that year because the available data did not show that the testing was saving lives . 
other medical groups , including the privately funded American Cancer Society , continued to advise women under 50 to have the screening and NCI took a second look at the issue this year .
