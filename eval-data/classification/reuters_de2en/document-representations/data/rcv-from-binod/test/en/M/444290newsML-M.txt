Asian bullion dealers had mixed views on gold &apos;s near-term direction , as the metal ended the week on a quiet note , eyeing the New York COMEX options expiry later on Friday . 
some dealers said market sentiment was bearish after the Swiss government &apos;s plan to sell some gold reserves over a 10 year period to fund a Holocaust &apos;s victims fund . 
but others in the British colony were more optimistic , partly due to the upcoming options expiry . 
&quot; There may be some action after the options expiry , &quot; said one bullion dealer . 
&quot; It &apos;s probably looking a little more positive than anything , there &apos;s a chance it may break higher next week , &quot; said the precious metals head at an international bank . 
&quot; The medium term is quite bullish , &quot; another dealer said , noting that U.S. funds wanted to keep short positions and cover if the dollar dipped . 
spot gold &apos;s short term was seen at between $ 351- $ 354 an ounce , at least until the options expiry , dealers in Singapore and Hong Kong said . 
&quot; It &apos;ll be a range market . 
there &apos;s fairly strong support at $ 350.50 ( an ounce ) , &quot; a bank trader in Singapore said . 
but some dealers said even if gold skipped up next week , there was good selling interest at $ 356 per ounce . 
as gold climbed through February and the beginning of March from $ 336 to $ 360 per ounce , operators covered their shorts and turned long , but were discouraged when the market refused to hold in the $ 360s , another senior Hong Kong bullion trader said . 
&quot; It &apos;s always justified to be short , &quot; he said . 
physical gold demand in Asia has slowed with the end of the Chinese Lunar New Year and Hari Raya peak season , but premiums are likely stay firm in a range-bound market , precious metal dealers in Singapore said . 
&quot; Despite the weaker price , demand is just not as strong as it was a month ago , &quot; a senior dealer for a Singapore-based bank said . 
&quot; The buying is coming from the same general region like the Chinese areas , but I think a lot of it is for re-export . 
&quot; The regional buyers are waiting for the prices to come off some more , &quot; another Singapore dealer said . 
one jeweller expected the demand to continue slowing with most fund managers preferring to put money in stocks and bonds than in precious metals . 
Singapore premiums firmed marginally to between 140-150 U.S. cents over spot London prices from last week &apos;s 120-140 cents as supplies of kilobars in the city-state remained tight . 
recent physical demand in Hong Kong was said to be slow , as the market had hovered above $ 350 an ounce and below $ 355 for a while now , and end-users were unwilling to buy at these levels . 
Hong Kong premiums , which touched 170 U.S. cents last month , had softened to around 120-130 U.S. cents and are likely to drop to around the 100 U.S. cents level in the near term . 
&quot; When the price goes up , producers try to sell more than before , so the premiums will drop slightly , &quot; one dealer said .
