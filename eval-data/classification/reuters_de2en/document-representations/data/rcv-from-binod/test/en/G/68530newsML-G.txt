Fred Funk fired a sparkling eight-under-par 63 on Saturday to catch overnight leader Pete Jordan and claim a share of the lead after three rounds of the B.C. 
open golf tournament . 
conditions for scoring were so good at the En-Joie Golf Club that Jordan &apos;s fine five-under 66 was only good enough to share top spot on the leaderboard despite starting the day with a three-stroke advantage over Funk , Tiger Woods and first-round leader Brian Claar . 
Funk and Jordan stood at 16-under 197 to take a three-stroke lead over Woods , who carded his second successive 66 , and Patrick Burke ( 65 ) into the final round . 
the little-known Jordan , who had never led after a round on the PGA Tour before Friday , birdied five of his first eight holes . 
but Funk also got off to a quick start , reaching five under par through six holes with the help of a chip-in eagle on the par-five fifth . 
Jordan picked up two more birdies , tapping in on the 12th hole and chipping in on 17 , but he closed with a bogey on 18 . 
he had also missed the green and bogeyed the ninth . 
Funk put together another hot streak after the turn with three consecutive birdies beginning with the 10th hole . 
he gave back a stroke on 15 before nailing a three-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole . 
&quot; It all seemed to go so fast , especially in the beginning when it seemed like either Fred or I made a birdie on every hole , &quot; said Jordan , who was paired with Funk . 
Jordan , who was forced to return to qualifying school in both 1993 and 1994 , currently stands 163rd on the money list and needs to finish third or better to assure his playing privileges for 1997 . 
Woods , who could sew up his tour spot for 1997 in just his fourth tournament since turning professional last month , is similarly focused on winning . 
&quot; I wasn &apos;t as sharp or precise as I wanted to be , but I got into the clubhouse with a good round and didn &apos;t shoot myself out of the tournament , &quot; said the three-time amateur champion . 
Woods , who led during the final round last week but fell to a fifth-place finish , suffered two bogeys on the front nine to go along with three birdies . 
he then picked up birdies on the 10th , 13th , 14th and 15th holes coming in , holing a bunker shot on 15 from 35 feet .
