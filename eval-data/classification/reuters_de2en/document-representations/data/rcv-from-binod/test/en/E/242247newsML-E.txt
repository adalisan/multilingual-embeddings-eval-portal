generally a small rise is expected , although it will be smaller than the 0.8 percent of the September quarter , and also smaller than the 0.8 percent increase of the December 1995 quarter , meaning that in year-to terms GDP growth would slow to around 3.5 percent . 
business inventories are expected to make a detraction from growth in the fourth quarter , while economists said that after some recent weakness public expenditure could be expected to make a contribution to growth . 
while the forecasts are only preliminary , they do show that most economists are looking for the record run of 21 quarters of positive growth to be extended , and they said that while economic activity is slowing , the economy is not likely to grind to a halt .

foreign debt - Net foreign debt is expected to have risen slightly over the quarter , although economists will not know the final split between equity and debt funding until the release of the quarterly balance of payments on Tuesday . 
the current account is expected to have added to the outstanding debt , while the currency effects are seen as miminal . 
a rise in line with expectations should not trouble the market , economists said . 
housing finance - These numbers date from before the last rate cut , and are expected to show a fairly large fall based on Australian Bankers Association figures . 
housing is showing some signs of recovery as the end of 1996 approaches , and economists said the anecdotal evidence suggests that new lending may have picked up quite strongly after the November 6 rate cut . 
the impact of the rate cuts will not be seen for some time yet , and so no good news is expected just yet . 
job advertisement series still weak , and employment a lagging indicator of growth , trend growth of around 10,000 positions per month could be expected . 
this may not be enough to stop the unemployment rate reaching 9.0 percent in coming months , but it should not move much higher than that . 
this is the mid month of the quarter , so it will be month that is used for the fourth quarter GDP calculations .
