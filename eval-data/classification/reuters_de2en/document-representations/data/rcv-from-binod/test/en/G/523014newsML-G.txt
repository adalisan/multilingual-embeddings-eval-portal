Pakistan recovered from the shock of losing Salim Elahi in the first ball of the innings to reach 78 for one wicket at tea on the second day of the first test against Sri Lanka on Sunday . 
Elahi offered no stroke to a Chaminda Vaas delivery which came back and trapped him leg before . 
however skipper Rameez Raja and Ijaz Ahmed settled down to take Pakistan forward . 
Rameez stroked the ball well and was undefeated on 43 , having hit three fours . 
Ijaz was on 26 . 
the pair looked comfortable on a pitch which had become benign after offering some assistance to slow bowlers on the first day . 
Sri Lanka &apos;s innings ended 20 minutes after lunch at 330 all out when off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq claimed a test career best of five wickets for 89 . 
his previous best was four wickets for 75 against Zimbabwe at Sheikhupura in 1995 / 1996 . 
Century-maker Hashan Tillekeratne added only two runs to his lunchtime total before attempting to cut Saqlain and offering Asif Mujtaba a simple catch at slip . 
Tillekeratne batted 349 minutes for his 103 runs , hitting 10 fours . 
Chaminda Vaas was dismissed without adding to his lunchtime score of 17 when he edged a catch to wicket-keeper Moin Khan off Mohammad Zahid , to see Sri Lanka at 322 for nine wickets . 
Saqlain finished off the innings by trapping Nuwan Zoysa in front of the wicket for nought , leaving Muralitharan unbeaten on eight . 
scores : Sri Lanka 330 all out . 
Pakistan 78 for one at tea ( Rameez Raja not out 43 , Ijaz Ahmed not out 26 ) .
