Brazil coach Mario Zagallo admitted on Wednesday he had been forced to name a makeshift squad for a brief European tour at the end of this month . 
Zagallo said he had stood by a policy of not picking more than one player from each team to avoid upsetting Brazilian clubs . 
the only exception made was Palmeiras who contributed full-back Cafu and midfielder Flavio Conceicao . 
&quot; We try not to upset the clubs but as a result the national team ends up suffering instead and is still always expected to win , &quot; he said . 
Brazil play friendlies away to Russia on August 28 and Netherlands three days later . 
unlike many countries , where the domestic programme is suspended on the weekend before a major international , Brazilian football carries on regardless . 
the tour is seen as the first step towards forming the team which the world champions will send to the 1998 World Cup in France . 
as holders , Brazil do not have to play in the qualifying competition . 
Zagallo included 32-year-old striker Bebeto and Barcelona &apos;s Ronaldo in the squad , despite a much-publicised row between them following the Olympic team &apos;s semifinal defeat by Nigeria at the Atlanta Games . 
Brazil had used most of their friendlies in the past year as warm-up matches for the Olympics , restricting Zagallo to players under 23 . 
bad results on the tour could put Zagallo &apos;s job in jeopardy following the failure to win the gold medal in Atlanta . 
the only uncapped player in the squad is central defender Goncalves who plays for Brazilian champions Botafogo . 
squad : 
Goalkeepers - Carlos Germano ( Vasco da Gama ) , Dida ( Cruzeiro ) 
defenders - Ze Maria ( Parma ) , Ze Roberto ( Portuguesa ) , Andre Luis ( Sao Paulo ) , Cafu ( Palmeiras ) , Goncalves ( Botafogo ) , Narciso ( Santos ) , Ronaldo Guiaro ( Atletico Mineiro ) , Andre Cruz ( Napoli )
