a leading U.N. official on Thursday contested Pope John Paul &apos;s view that hunger is not linked to over-population , saying the world &apos;s future food needs would be inextricably linked to demographic changes . 
&quot; Action on population policy in the next decade will determine our demographic future , and with it future food needs , &quot; Nafis Sadik , executive director of the U.N. Population Fund , told a U.N.-sponsored World Food Summit . 
Sadik , who had heated clashes with the Pope and the Vatican over a stormy U.N. population conference in Cairo in 1994 , spoke a day after the Pontiff , who inaugurated the summit , flatly rejected population control as the answer to food shortages . 
Sadik said world population was now 5.9 billion and rising by 86 million a year . 
she told the summit that the population in the middle of the next century could be as low as eight billion or as high as 12 billion -- a difference equal to the world population in 1975 . 
the Pope had told the summit that demography alone could not explain inadequate distribution of food resources and rejected as &quot; sophistry &quot; a view that &quot; when there are many , one is condemned to be poor &quot; . 
&quot; It would be illusory to believe that an arbitrary stabilisation of the world population , or even its reduction , could solve the problem of hunger directly , &quot; he said . 
Sadik , a Pakistani who had a stormy meeting with the Pope before the 1994 population conference which she organised , told the food summit that empowering women to make their own choices would help slow and eventually stabilise population growth . 
&quot; In most countries with high rates of population growth , women would like to have fewer children than their parents &apos; generation . 
if women could choose , families would be smaller and population gowth slower , &quot; she said . 
she said women in poor countries had to be equipped with the information and means to time preganancy . 
&quot; Ensuring the ability of women and men to exercise their reproductive rights will have a decisive impact on population growth and on prospects for food security in the 21st century , &quot; she said . 
the issue of &quot; reproductive rights &quot; was the minefield at the Cairo conference because the Vatican felt the phrase was a backdoor way of supporting abortion as a means of controlling population growth . 
Sadik , who did not refer to the Pope &apos;s address in her speech , said governments had to make reproducive rights and reproductive health &quot; priorities in national and international development programmes &quot; . 
at the Cairo conference the Vatican accused some developing countries and international development agencies of making aid conditional on their acceptance of birth control programmes to stem their population growth . 
the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church have defended the right of couples to have as many children as they want .
