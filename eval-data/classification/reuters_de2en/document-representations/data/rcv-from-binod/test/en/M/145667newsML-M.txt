ivory Coast &apos;s farm-gate coffee price in the 1996 / 97 marketing season will be susceptible to change in the light of fluctuating world prices , a cabinet statement said . 
the statement , published in the government daily Fraternite Matin on Saturday after Friday &apos;s cabinet meeting , said the government had instructed the minister of agriculture and animal resources to close the 1995 / 96 season &quot; in the coming weeks . 
at the same time , Lambert Kouassi Konan was instructed to open the 1996 / 97 marketing season and fix a guideline farm-gate price per kg , it added , noting that talks with operators in the sector had already been held . 
the cabinet did not go as far as to say the farm-gate price would be directly linked to world prices . 
&quot; It is understood that this guide price will be susceptible to modifications linked to prices on the international market , &quot; it said . 
the government , which opened the cocoa marketing season on Thursday with an unchanged farm-gate price , usually announces the start of the coffee season and the farm-gate price at the same time . 
last year &apos;s coffee season began on October 7 . 
industry sources have linked the delay to low world coffee prices . 
world Bank officials predict that Ivory Coast will have to subsidise the coffee sector from the cocoa sector in the 1996 / 97 season .
