on the eve of a trip to Europe to help with the birth of an expanded NATO , President Bill Clinton on Thursday huddled with national security advisers and mobilised military veterans to support the expansion . 
Clinton , who leaves late on Friday for Spain , received a full-scale trip briefing from his advisers at a morning meeting , White House spokesman Mike McCurry said . 
it was a prelude to an afternoon ceremony in the White House East Room where leaders of 34 U.S. veterans groups were to endorse enlarging the Western alliance by adding new members in former Communist central and eastern Europe . 
a senior White House official discounted a New York Times report on Thursday that France had bowed to Clinton &apos;s wish to limit the first round of expansion to Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , paving the way for a harmonious NATO summit in Madrid on July 8-9 . 
France , Germany and Italy have been waging a noisy diplomatic campaign to invite Romania and Slovenia to join NATO in the first round as well . 
asked about the report , the official cautioned that the difference of opinion had not yet been fully resolved . 
&quot; We have a lot more work to do . 
... We expect this issue will be very much alive and under discussion in Madrid , &quot; he said . 
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will fly first to Majorca to be guests of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia at a Moorish castle . 
they will go to Madrid on Monday for the two-day summit , which opens the next day . 
Clinton planned to visit Poland on Thursday and Romania on Friday before going to Denmark for a state visit . 
while NATO expansion has stirred little public debate in the United States so far , many members of the foreign policy establishment are against it , including such disparate individuals as former Defence Secretary Robert McNamara and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger . 
they argue that expansion will tend to destabilise Europe by antagonizing Russia and creating envy among former Soviet bloc states that are excluded from the 48-year-old alliance , which was conceived as a bulwark against Moscow . 
the Pentagon has estimated expansion will cost U.S. taxpayers $ 150 million to $ 200 million a year over the next 10 years . 
a poll conducted by the Pew Research Foundation indicated the U.S. public is almost evenly split on whether NATO should take in new members . 
forty-three percent favoured expansion , while 41 percent wanted the alliance to stay as is . 
the survey of 1,206 adults , conducted on April 3-6 , found that 14 percent had no opinion on expansion and two percent wanted NATO eliminated . 
the poll found substantial support for a larger NATO among the six percent of Americans who follow the issue closely . 
sixty-one percent of them favoured expansion .
