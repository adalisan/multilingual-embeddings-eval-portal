the Securities and Exchange Commission plans to propose a series of rules in early 1997 that would set specific disclosure and reporting standards for the asset-backed securities market , an SEC official said Friday . 
&quot; We are envisioning the adoption of a series of rules within Regulation SK that will be disclosure rules specifically for the asset-backed market , &quot; Michael Mitchell , special counsel to the SEC &apos;s Division of Corporation Finance , said . 
Mitchell , who announced the plan at a Public Securities Association workshop here , said SEC plans to propose the rules early next year . 
Mitchell said &quot; we are considering a full range of alternatives . 
SEC does not want to write regulations that are &quot; so constraining &quot; that they undermine the commission &apos;s overall goal for the asset-backed market , he said . 
that goal , Mitchell said , is to &quot; promote flexibility and allow issuers to evaluate appropriate disclosure for a particular asset pool . 
Mitchell said SEC also may adopt new forms under the federal securities laws specifically targeted for use by asset-backed issuers . 
he said SEC does not plan to completely eliminate the shelf-registration process for asset-backed securities . 
Mitchell stressed that no plan is etched in stone . 
&quot; These are ideas . 
they are not the course we are specifically taking , &quot; Mitchell said . 
he said SEC encourages a full &quot; dialogue and debate &quot; on the upcoming rules .
