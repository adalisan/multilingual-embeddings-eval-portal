planes of the anti-Taleban alliance bombed the capital Kabul twice on Saturday , aiming for the main airport northeast of the city but causing little damage and no casualties , witnesses said . 
the alliance bombers mounted two air raids on Saturday morning , witnesses said . 
one bomb fell in an open area the during the first raid at 5.50 a.m. ( 0120 GMT ) . 
in the second air raid , three hours later , two bombs were dropped . 
eyewitnesses said one of the bombs fell on or near one of the airport &apos;s runways , although this was denied by a Taleban commander at the airport . 
it was not possible to independently confirm the reports . 
journalists are not allowed into the airport . 
the bombers of the anti-Taleban alliance have launched frequent raids on Kabul in recent weeks , most of them around the airport . 
three children were killed and seven other people were wounded when two houses were partially destroyed in a bombing raid ten days ago . 
on November 6 , a young girl was injured and two houses in the city centre were destroyed in another air-raid . 
Afghan watchers in Kabul said the air-raids have a dual purpose : to prevent the Taleban from using the airport as a base for their warplanes and to deny the Taleban &apos;s claim that they have brought security to the capital . 
Kabul has been on the front line of Afghanistan &apos;s civil war for more than four years , and foreign observers say many of the residents would support the faction that can prevent the bloodshed and dislocation that has affected their lives . 
the fundamentalist Islamic Taleban seized Kabul in late September and now control alomst 75 percent of the country . 
they are fighting the forces of an alliance of the ousted government and northern Uzbek leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum &apos;s Jumbish-i-Milli faction about 20 to 25 kilometers ( 15 to 19 miles ) north of Kabul , and also in the northwest of the country . 
the fighting to the north of Kabul has stagnated . 
despite frequent attacks by alliance forces they have been unable to take a strategic line of hills that would open the road to Kabul . 
exchanges of artillery and rocket fire continued on Saturday , but Taleban commanders said on Saturday morning that there had been no significant change in the front line . 
United Nations-sponsored peace talks are being held in the Pakistani capital Islamabad between representatives of General Dostum and the Taleban . 
U.N. special envoy Norbert Holl told a news conference on Thursday in Islamabad that the meeting between the Taleban &apos;s acting Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Ghous and General Paynda , speaking for the opposition axis , had been &quot; good &quot; , but had not produced any immediate result . 
&quot; It was not an easy meeting , &quot; Holl said , adding he expected to bring the two sides together again after a meeting on Afghanistan at the United Nations in New York on November 18 .
