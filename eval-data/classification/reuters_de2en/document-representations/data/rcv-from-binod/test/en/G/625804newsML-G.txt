world soccer governing body FIFA has decided against an international ban on France goalkeeper Bernard Lama after he tested positive for cannabis . 
FIFA said on Friday that it was a decision of the French national federation to ban Lama for five months in May for playing for his club Paris St Germain . 
legally it is a matter for the national federation and it must decide whether he is banned or not , &quot; FIFA official Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder said after a meeting where the case was discussed . 
it also appears that if Lama , who tested positive in February , were to leave France and move abroad , FIFA would be unlikely to intervene . 
it would also remain a matter for the national federation . 
Lama was handed a five-month ban , three months of which were suspended . 
he is believed to have had offers from clubs in Spain and England .
