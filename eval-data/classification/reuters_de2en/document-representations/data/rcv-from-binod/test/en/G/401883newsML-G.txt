the Democratic National Committee expects to return more campaign funds that are considered improper once an internal audit of donors is completed , Democratic party sources said on Tuesday . 
the audit , ordered after news accounts listed improper or illegal donations to the party , may be completed later this week when the party expects to announce more refunds , sources said . 
the party has already returned over $ 1.4 million in contributions deemed improper , according to a tally put out by the committee . 
separately , the Washington Post said that at least one of the contributions under review came from a foreign developer who holds an advisory post with China &apos;s communist government . 
the $ 15,000 contribution came from ng lap Seng , a Macao property developer and was made in the name of his company &apos;s Little Rock , Arkansas , subsidiary , San King Yip Inc . , the Post said . 
the Post said it was the first of a growing number of DNC contributions to be called into question to be linked to anyone with an official tie to the Chinese government . 
ng serves on the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou . 
under federal law , donors must give their own funds and must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents . 
corporate gifts to political parties may not come from foreign sources but U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies can give contributions . 
ng &apos;s contribution was made in October 1994 , 10 days after the firm was incorporated . 
in interviews last month , the Post said ng acknowledged that the money did not come from U.S.-generated funds as required under federal law , and that other contributions by his partner , Charles Yah Lin Trie , a close friend of President Bill Clinton , might have originally come from ng &apos;s business interests in China , Hong Kong and the Portuguese enclave of Macao . 
several prominent Democrats , including Wisconsin Sen. Russell Feingold , over the weekend called for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the fund raising practices of both parties during the 1996 election . 
Feingold is a co-sponsor of legislation that Clinton backs to reform the campaign finance system . 
the White House on Monday reiterated that it would not comment on whether an independent counsel should be named , referring queries to the Justice Department , which is responsible for such appointments . 
Trie is under investigation by the Justice Department as part of its probe of the DNC fund raising practices . 
the DNC has already returned about $ 1.5 million of the money it collected during the presidential campaign , and hopes to complete its internal audit by Friday . 
among the other contributions under review , the Post reported , were those from Jessica Elnitiarta , an Indonesian-American businesswoman from Los Angeles , who gave $ 250,000 last year . 
questions have also been raised about Keshi Zhan , an Arlington County records clerk who has worked part-time for Trie and ng as a hostess . 
Zhan earns about $ 22,400 in her job , but gave $ 12,500 to attend a fund-raiser last year at the Hay Adams Hotel .
