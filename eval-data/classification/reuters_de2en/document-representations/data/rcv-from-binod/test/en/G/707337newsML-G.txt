religion , branded the &quot; opium of the people &quot; by Karl Marx and despised by Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin , has made a strong comeback in Russia since the collapse of atheistic communism six years ago . 
but although all religions are equal under the country &apos;s post-Soviet constitution some , in the eyes of many Russian churchmen and politicians , are more equal than others . 
their backing of a bill that would clamp down on &quot; non-traditional &quot; religious groups and foreign missionaries has sparked fears among human rights activists that Russia is returning to Soviet-style repression and discrimination . 
the bill has the blessing of Russia &apos;s most senior clergyman , Patriarch Alexiy , and has already cleared its last hurdle in the State Duma lower house of parliament , which is dominated by communists and ultra-nationalists . 
it must now be approved by the upper house , the Federation Council , and by President Boris Yeltsin before it becomes law . 
&quot; There should be order in the religious sphere and this new law will help bring order , &quot; Patriarch Alexiy , head of the powerful Orthodox Church , told reporters recently . 
the bill distinguishes between &quot; religious organisations &quot; , which encompass traditional Russian faiths like Orthodoxy , Islam , Buddhism and Judaism , and &quot; religious groups &quot; that would have to wait 15 years before applying for full legal rights . 
in the meantime the &quot; groups &quot; would not have the right to publish religious materials or to worship in public places . 
under the bill , only confessions that were officially registered at least 15 years ago can qualify as &quot; religious organisations &quot; , but critics point out that in 1982 Russia was still tightly controlled by the atheistic Communist Party . 
the bill &quot; On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations &quot; also states that foreign missionaries can only operate if invited by a Russian religious organisation . 
&quot; This is a giant step backwards for religious freedom and for civil rights in a law-governed state , &quot; said Lawrence Uzzell , Moscow representative of the British-based Keston Institute , which monitors religious rights in central and eastern Europe . 
&quot; The bill is also unconstitutional because it denies equal status to different religious organisations , &quot; he told Reuters . 
supporters of the bill say it will help control the big post-communist explosion in religious sects that have fed on Russians &apos; poverty , spiritual hunger or simple curiosity . 
Japan &apos;s notorious Aum Shinri Kyo , for example , had many followers in Russia . 
&quot; New sects are harmful because they don &apos;t consolidate society but divide it . 
they are often forbidden in their home countries , &quot; Archbishop Sergei , chancellor of the Moscow Patriarchy , told Reuters . 
Patriarch Alexiy went even further . 
&quot; Today &apos;s proselytism , by foreign sects and missionaries ... in Russia is something of an eastward expansion and you may perhaps draw parallels with NATO &apos;s expansion to the East , &quot; he said , referring to another issue that has upset Russian conservatives . 
but the Roman Catholic Church -- Eastern Orthodoxy &apos;s age-old sparring partner -- and many mainstream Protestant churches also face potential obstacles under the Duma &apos;s bill . 
&quot; The more extreme cults have passed their peak in Russia . 
young people are less drawn to them than in the early 1990s . 
this bill actually enables the state and ( Orthodox ) church to crack down on the Protestant and Catholic churches and on rivals within their own structure , &quot; said Uzzell . 
the Orthodox Church has long resented incursions by foreign-based churches on to what it sees as its own turf . 
&quot; Russia is an Orthodox country . 
it is not just a word or an interpretation , it is a deep historical truth , &quot; said Archbishop Sergei , adding that Roman Catholic expansion into Russia was linked in the nation &apos;s collective subconscious to the country &apos;s Time of Troubles in the 17th century and to foreign domination . 
&quot; The Catholics are establishing missions in Siberia , and at at time when we are talking about unity between the churches this can only divide , &quot; he said . 
underlining the deep-seated suspicion between Russia &apos;s Orthodox Church and the Vatican , Patriarch Alexiy and Pope John Paul put off a meeting in Austria last month that would have been the first since the Great schism of 1054 . 
&quot; Clearly the Orthodox Church is closely tied up with Russian national identity and it has been feeling rather threatened by the influx of often wealthy missionaries from the United States , &quot; said Diederik Lohman of Humans Rights Watch / Helsinki . 
&quot; But the proposed legislation is not the solution , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It is vaguely worded and so lends itself to arbitrary interpretation . 
echoing this fear , the Keston Institute &apos;s Uzzell said a zealous bureaucrat in provincial Russia could use the law to shut down a local parish church . 
&quot; It may be used to freeze Catholic or Protestant parishes at current levels , &quot; he said . 
the liberal daily Sevodnya has decried what it calls a cosy alliance of state , church and parliament . 
&quot; The fight against heresy has united the government and the Duma , &quot; it said recently , noting the reformist cabinet and more conservative deputies rarely agreed on much else . 
human rights activists said they had been generally dismayed by the lack of liberal opposition to the bill in parliament , where only eight deputies voted against its final reading . 
&quot; This partly reflects the more nationalistic mood among Russian politicians , &quot; said Lohman . 
in recent years politicians of every hue -- including Yeltsin , Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov and ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky -- have played up their links with the Orthodox Church as proof of their patriotic credentials . 
&quot; Now we must see whether Yeltsin will sign the bill , &quot; said Uzzell . 
&quot; It could still go either way . 
despite his liberal record he still faces two major sources of domestic pressure -- the Orthodox Church and the Russian Communist Party .
