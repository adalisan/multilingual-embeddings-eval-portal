Saudi authorities have arrested 11 people in connection with a June blast that killed 19 Americans at a military housing complex in eastern Saudi Arabia , a Beirut daily newspaper close to Saudi circles said on Thursday . 
&quot; Saudi authorities have dismantled a sabotage network and arrested the saboteurs who planned or carried out the blast at the American forces housing complex in Dammam , &quot; al-Bayrak daily said in a brief frontpage report . 
&quot; They are being interrogated minutely and in utmost secrecy , &quot; al-Bayrak added . 
the paper said there was a link between the 11 suspects and &quot; elements &quot; behind a November 13 , 1995 explosion that killed seven people , including five Americans , at the U.S.-run Saudi National Guard headquarters in Riyadh . 
three groups , the Tigers of the Gulf , the Islamic Movement for Change , and the combatant partisans of God Organisation , have claimed responsibility for the Riyadh blast . 
four Saudis who confessed to carrying it out have been executed . 
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz was closely following up the interrogation of the 11 suspects , said al-Bayrak , whose owner / publisher Milhem Karam , head of the Lebanese editors Syndicate , is close to Saudi officials . 
&quot; He awaits the investigation to end to announce the names of the instigators , their plans , the executors , parties that financed them from abroad and the country that hosted their meetings , &quot; it added . 
the fuel truck bomb , which ripped through a housing complex for the King Abdul-Aziz airbase where some 3,000 Americans were based , also wounded about 400 people of different nationalities . 
Al-Bayrak said the 11 suspects had &quot; infiltrated a licenced entity in Saudi Arabia and capitalised on the trust that this entity has , moved from within it , therefore they were not suspected at the start . 
but it said the authority and influence of this entity have fallen after it became subject to very strict supervision .
