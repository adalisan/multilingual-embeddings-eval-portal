Palestinian President Yasser Arafat arrived in Cairo on Sunday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and said he was hopeful the stalled Middle East peace process could be advanced . 
&quot; We face many difficulties in our talks with the Israeli side which is trying to avoid accurate and honest implementation of what has been agreed upon , &quot; Arafat told reporters at Cairo airport . 
&quot; But we hope to succeed in achieving results to satisfy the Palestinian people and to preserve the peace process and push it forward , &quot; he added . 
Arafat &apos;s visit coincided with an emergency meeting of the 22-member Arab League in the Egyptian capital over Israel &apos;s settlement policies . 
( corrects number of members in Arab League to 22 from 12 ) 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has infuriated Arabs by refusing to trade occupied Arab lands for peace -- the basic principle of a 1991 Madrid peace accord -- and by lifting a ban imposed by the former government on building Jewish settlements on these lands . 
the Palestinian representative at the meeting warned Israel its policies would reignite violence in the region .
