Hong Kong &apos;s Hang Seng Index fell in morning trade on Tuesday as concerns about the health of China &apos;s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping returned to plague the market . 
the index fell 130.89 points to an early low of 13,013.73 before paring its losses later to trade down 60.17 points , or 0.46 percent , at 13,084.45 . 
turnover was HK $ 1.28 billion after the first half hour of trade . 
February index futures fell 105 points to 13,100 . 
sources said on Monday that Deng &apos;s deteriorating health had forced Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and other leaders to cut short provincial trips to return to Beijing . 
&quot; I think in the short term the market will continue to be plagued by speculation of the deterioration of Deng &apos;s health and that will keep investors on the sidelines , &quot; said Ben Kwong , director of research at Dharmala Securities . 
&quot; The market might make use of this as an excuse for further consolidation , &quot; he said . 
concerns about Deng &apos;s health contributed to a 547-point slide in the Hang Seng Index last week . 
analysts said support should be found around 13,000 points . 
Kent Rossiter , institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities , said investors were not rushing to sell . 
&quot; The market is likely to trade sideways over the next couple of days , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There is still some worry about Deng Xiaoping , whether his death is imminent or not . 
I don &apos;t think it is going to have a lasting impact on China &apos;s policy or on the stock market , &quot; Rossiter added . 
the company said it would book an exceptional profit of HK $ 1.24 billion from the disposal of its stake in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd to Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd . 
it also said its unaudited consolidated profit for the four-month period to October 31 , 1996 , amounted to about HK $ 2.98 billion .
