Egypt said on Wednesday the reelection of U.S. President Bill Clinton meant Washington would keep working for progress in Middle East peace talks . 
information Minister Safwat el-Sherif , interviewed on the Arabic service of the BBC , said the outcome of the election indicated that the United States would continue to play its active and dominant role as mediator between Arabs and Israel . 
on the contrary , the election of President Bill Clinton shows the continuity of U.S. policies and U.S. priorities , especially towards international relations and the Middle East , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The United States has been a basic partner in the peace process since the start . 
under Clinton too the U.S. administration has been a basic element . 
&quot; So the presence of President Clinton and his administration and his election no doubt gives confidence that this partner will continue the peace process and will do everything possible to narrow the gap between points of views , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The peace process has already gone a long way . 
what we need now is to save the peace process and remove the obstacles that stand in its way , &quot; he added .
