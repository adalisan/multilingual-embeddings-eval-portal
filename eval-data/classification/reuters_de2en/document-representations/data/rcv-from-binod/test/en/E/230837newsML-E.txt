Lithuania &apos;s new right-wing dominated parliament on Tuesday voted for plans to audit all state debt and state guarantees for loans , politicians said . 
Elvira Kunaviciene , head of parliament &apos;s finance and economics committee , said the audit would show just how much the state owed and how loans had been used . 
&quot; Every citizen of Lithuania , every member of parliament should know how much the state owes , &quot; Kuneviciene told Reuters . 
Lithuania &apos;s new government , led by the right-wing Homeland Union , has often accused its ex-Communist predecessors of corruption . 
it has also said it wants to get a clear picture of the economy as it takes office . 
&quot; It is necessary for the state &apos;s prestige to know what its debt is and that we are ready to pay it , &quot; Kunaviciene added . 
the central bank said on Monday foreign loans in Lithuania came to 657.1 million litas in the first half and that the total external debt by the end of the third quarter was $ 987 million . 
Kuneviciene said the audit would also more clearly show the situation with Lithuania &apos;s state-owned firms . 
she said a competition would be launched to find a firm to carry out the audit . 
she said she would prefer the audit was done by an international company . 
Kunaviciene said once an auditor had been chosen , the project could be completed in a few weeks .
