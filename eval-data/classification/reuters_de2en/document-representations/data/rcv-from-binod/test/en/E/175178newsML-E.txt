Brazil can finance its burgeoning trade deficit through investment , and will not need to rein in economic growth in pursuit of current accounts improvement , the country &apos;s central banker said Friday . 
Gustavo Loyola , president of the Brazil &apos;s central bank , said there were no plans to alter monetary policy or change the pace of currency depreciation . 
&quot; This trade deficit can be financed easily through direct investment or long-term capital , &quot; Loyola told reporters after a conference here . 
Loyola vowed to stay the &quot; stay the course &quot; of lowering domestic interest rates and gradually allowing the real to depreciate with its band system . 
&quot; We don &apos;t see any need to reduce the pace of the current growth , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any need for a change in exchange rate policy . 
Brazil posted a $ 655 million trade gap in September and Brazilian economists believed the deficit could widen another $ 1.0 billion in October to reach $ 4.0 billion by year end . 
Loyola pegged this year &apos;s current account deficit at about three percent of GDP , and forecast the same level for 1997 , and added that the trade performance was actually &quot; very good . 
&quot; Exports are growing at a very good pace , 5-6 percent per year , &quot; he said . 
he reaffirmed the country &apos;s commitment to foreign bond issuance to pay down some of its heavy domestic debt burden , but offered no timetable of when this would take place . 
Brazil was continuing to study Brady bond buyback plans , but no decision has been made , Loyola said .
