Kurdish rebels warned France on Wednesday that withholding support from U.S. missile strikes against Iraqi targets was tantamount to backing Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and would jeopardise its interests there . 
&quot; If French policy persists in its double-talk , the future democratic regime in Iraq will not be able to guarantee the protection of French interests , &quot; the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) said in a statement issued in Paris . 
&quot; Some statements and acts entail such serious consequences that they are not easily forgotten , &quot; the statement said . 
Washington fired cruise missiles at Iraq after Baghdad &apos;s forces and guerrillas of the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) captured the city of Arbil from their PUK rivals . 
Paris , which fought in the coalition which ejected Iraqi forces from Kuwait and was a driving force behind the imposition of a no-fly zone over the Kurdish area of northern Iraq , has expressed concern at the situation and called for dialogue . 
it said it had not agreed in advance to President Bill Clinton &apos;s decision to extend the no-fly zone imposed after the 1991 Gulf War from the 32nd to the 33th parallel , and its planes stayed well clear of the new exclusion zone on Wednesday . 
U.S. Defence Secretary Willam Perry said he expected France would continue to participate in the allied coalition . 
the PUK said France had saved millions of lives by pushing through the United Nations the right to intervention to &quot; protect civilians against dictators having until then the right to life and death over their own population within borders considered inviolable . 
&quot; Does the French government have the right today to renounce the ideals which have made France great ? 
&quot; it asked . 
the PUK said France was asking the Iraqi leader to watch over the security of the civilian population , &quot; as if one asked the wolf to watch over the health of the lamb &quot; . 
the KDP has said it had allied itself with the Iraqi army to combat aggression by Iran and &quot; treachery &quot; by the PUK .
