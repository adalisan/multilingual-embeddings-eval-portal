London and Bonn joined forces on Thursday to banish the stereotypes of goose-stepping Germans and stiff-upper-lipped Britons , launching a book which compares their relations to an efficient traffic system . 
the book , &quot; crossroads and roundabouts &quot; by respected German journalist and commentator Thomas Kielinger , provides a humorous but thorough examination of the roles Germans and Britons have played in each other &apos;s history . 
Prime Minister John Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl set the project in motion at a bilateral summit in 1994 , when they noted with concern that a poll showed Britons and Germans had a remarkably low opinion of each other . 
&quot; Anyone who reads this book will learn something and everyone who reads it will be entertained , &quot; British ambassador Sir Nigel Broomfield , whose embassy helped to oversee the project , said at the book &apos;s launch in Bonn . 
in a spirit of true cooperation , the book was written by a German but the layout was designed by a British firm and it has been published simultaneously in both German and English . 
&quot; It &apos;s an absolute joint venture , &quot; declared a spokeswoman at the German government &apos;s press office , which has published the book together with the British Foreign Office . 
the tenor of the book is that although the countries have been to war twice this century and are often at loggerheads on the future of the European Union , they are not so different . 
bur Broomfield admitted Germans and Britons had not always been on the same wavelength . 
&quot; When Germans were busy creating the idealist school of philosophy , people in Britain were perfecting the rules of cricket and croquet , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s upbeat without submitting to wishful thinking , &quot; said Kielinger , who believes you don &apos;t have to go any further than a main road to see differences between Germans and Britons remain . 
&quot; The country with no written constitution prefers roundabouts at its traffic junctions , &quot; he notes in the book . 
&quot; The country of mandatory and prohibitory regulations swears by the crossroads as the most reliable form of traffic control . 
the book &apos;s launch comes after a year in which the traffic flow between Germany and Britain has not always been smooth . 
British tabloids evoked World War Two imagery as England prepared to play Germany during the European soccer championships in June and Bonn spearheaded the EU &apos;s move to ban British beef over fears about BSE , the &quot; mad cow disease &quot; . 
happily for the two governments , the book concludes that the former battlefield enemies may still have their differences but these are now complementary . 
&quot; Is it not a fact that modern traffic systems need both crossroads and roundabouts , rigorous and flexible principles ? 
&quot; Kielinger writes . 
&quot; At the point of synthesis , these two opposities meet in inseparable fellowship . 
the paperback is available free of charge from the German embassy in London and the British embassy in Bonn . 
a hardback edition will go on sale soon in Germany and officials also hope to market an English edition in Britain . 
Kielinger , who served as a foreign correspondent in London , goes out of his way to show how both Germans and Britons differ from the stereotypes often applied to them . 
but he admits there is truth in some of the cliches . 
&quot; Apart from sporting events , where passionate commitment is permitted , the British tend to treat the world of emotions like Euro-sceptics treat Brussels -- as far as possible , they avoid it like the plague , &quot; he observes .
