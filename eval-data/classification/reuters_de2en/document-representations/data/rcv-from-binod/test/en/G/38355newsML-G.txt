Sudanese rebels said they killed 15 members of the pro-government National Islamic Front ( NIF ) in an attack close to the Eritrean border on Friday morning . 
the Sudan Alliance Forces , military wing of the National Democratic Alliance , said its men attacked a position in the Awad al-Marba area , 15 km ( nine miles ) east of Kassala town . 
&quot; The operation left 15 dead and five wounded in the ranks of the Islamic Front and the position was held for a limited time . 
our forces returned safely to their positions , &quot; the group said in a faxed statement . 
Kassala is about 20 km ( 12 miles ) west of the border with Eritrea , where the rebel forces have bases and training camps approved by the Eritrean authorities . 
there was no independent confirmation of the attack and Sudanese officials in Khartoum were not available to comment . 
the National Islamic Front was nominally disbanded in 1989 but Sudanese continue to use the term for followers of Islamist leader Hassan al-Turabi , the speaker of the Sudanese parliament and the ideological force behind the government . 
the statement called on Sudanese soldiers , policemen and militia members to mutiny against their leaders and join the rebels in a campaign to overthrow the government . 
it described recent protests in Khartoum , mainly at bread shortages , as a popular uprising and a step towards armed popular rebellion . 
at least two people have died in the unrest .
