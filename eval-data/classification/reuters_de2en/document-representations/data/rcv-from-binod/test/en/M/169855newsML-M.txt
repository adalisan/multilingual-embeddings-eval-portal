a bearish longer-term outlook for cash cattle offset this week &apos;s strength in cash cattle and boxed beef prices , sources said . 
the market also met technical resistance , they added . 
&quot; The outlook is getting in the cattle &apos;s ( futures ) way despite the good shape of the cash market , &quot; said Chuck Levitt , senior livestock analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. 
&quot; Right now they are trading futures and they say by December , the cash market is going to be down considerably from here , the cow slaughter is going to pick up and we will have more cattle coming off the feedlots , &quot; he added . 
traders said early strength reflected the recent sharp rise in choice beef values and $ 1 per cwt gain in fed cattle prices .

in live cattle options , volatility was steady to firm . 
there was out of the money call spreading early , buying February 66 and selling December 67 and 68 , pit sources added . 
feeder cattle failed to hold initial strength as locals turned sellers when fund buying subsided . 
higher corn futures and a lack of active support in live cattle also weighed on prices , traders said . 
a lot of longs wanted to take profits , &quot; one trader said . 
the latest CME feeder cattle index was up $ 0.01 at $ 63.22 per cwt . 
Refco bought November feeders and E.D. &amp; F. Man bought January early .
