play at the French Open was interrupted by rain for the first time in the tournament on Monday , allowing Chilean seventh seed Marcelo Rios some much-needed breathing space . 
Rios was trailing Morocco &apos;s Hicham Arazi by two sets to one when the weather halted play with the pair level at 2-2 in the fourth set of their fourth round match . 
the other remaining men &apos;s singles encounter between Australians Pat Rafter and Mark Woodforde was also in a fourth set , with Rafter leading 6-2 5-7 6-1 3-1 when the rain began .
