most Polish shares fell in stable turnover but gains of some stocks pushed the main index up and analysts expected the bourse to extend gains as certain stocks still seemed a good bargain and might create new demand . 
the main market &apos;s WIG index rose 0.3 percent , to 16,528.9 , and turnover was virtually flat at 180.7 million zlotys ( $ 60.2 million ) on both markets with 35 issues falling , 33 rising and 19 flat . 
some analysts said the market trading at 16 times historic earnings seemed fairly valued but earnings growth prospects made prices of several stocks look more attractive . 
&quot; As far as emerging markets are concerned P / E of 16 is not bad , but investors pay even greater attention to earnings forecasts , which are good , &quot; said Czeslaw Pospieszynski , an analyst at Bank Gdanski brokerage . 
analysts said the bourse seemed unruffled by the Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko resignation , but said investors would be watching carefully moves of his successor Marek Belka . 
industrial boilermaker Rafako surged 9.7 percent on a newspaper report that it had finished works on a contract possibly worth about $ 30 million , traders said . 
Bank Ochrony Srodowiska ( Bos ) extended Tuesday &apos;s loss , falling 5.4 percent in profit-taking after its Monday &apos;s debut 65.5 percent higher than its issue price of 29 zlotys ( $ 9.7 ) . 
shares rose in continuous trade in a 12 million-zloty ( $ 4 million ) turnover with the WIG 20 index up 0.9 percent to 1,699.9 points .
