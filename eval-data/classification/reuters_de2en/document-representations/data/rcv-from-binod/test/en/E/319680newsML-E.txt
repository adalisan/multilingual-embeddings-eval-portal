Italy &apos;s economy in 1997 will grow at a slower pace than expected with no signs of an upturn until the second half of the year , while a cut in Italian interest rates is expected by the end of March , economists said . 
a Reuter quarterly poll of 18 analysts showed average forecasts for real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth of 1.2 percent against an estimate three months ago of 1.5 percent . 
while the survey showed that the long-awaited reduction in Italy &apos;s key interest rates will come at the latest by end-March , and could be followed by another , but the global scenario is set to change making any further easing tougher . 
the Bank of Italy &apos;s major indicator for cutting interest rates has been Italian consumer price inflation . 
this is seen improving further in 1997 with the average annual rate falling to 2.6 percent from 3.9 percent in 1996 in line with the Bank of Italy &apos;s goal of a rate below 3.0 percent . 
the government &apos;s official GDP growth target for 1997 is 2.0 percent following an expected 0.8 percent rise in 1996 . 
but last week , Italian Labour Minister Tiziano Treu said GDP this year was seen growing between 1.2 and 1.5 percent . 
&quot; I expect this year to be a year of recovery even if it won &apos;t be sparkling , &quot; he said without elaborating . 
Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio has been even more pessimistic , saying : &quot; Economic growth in 1997 will not be far from the unsatisfactory figure seen in 1996 . 
analysts polled said that still depressed levels of private and public consumer demand would brake economic growth , while investment was seen increasing , although only modestly . 
Italy &apos;s foreign trade balance was seen making a positive contribution with exports continuing to increase more than imports rise , while stocks after a strong drawdown last year would be built up again gradually . 
&quot; The cycle will be influenced by the European economic trend and in particular by the speed of the German locomotive , &quot; said Alfredo Granata , analyst at Banca di Roma . 
all the economists surveyed said a boost to the economy from domestic demand would remain limited , leading to less growth in Italy &apos;s GDP than the European average . 
on inflation , the government &apos;s official target is for an average rate of 2.5 percent for 1997 . 
but it is difficult to foresee a fall below 2.6 percent , the survey showed . 
in fact , analysts expect on average to see a 2.8 percent CPI rate for 1998 , higher than current levels and the 2.6 percent expectation for 1997 . 
inflation in December 1996 was steady on November at 2.6 percent year-on-year . 
an eventual dip below 2.6 / 2.5 percent this year &quot; will also depend on inflation rates abroad , &quot; said Paolo Casadio of Credito Italiano . 
&quot; There is a barrier not only for Italy at 2.5 percent , but also for the whole of Europe at around 2.0 percent . 
on interest rates , the poll showed forecasts were for a 75 basis point cut in the Bank of Italy &apos;s 7.50 percent discount rate in the first quarter of 1997 , followed by a further fall to 6.25 percent sometime by the end of 1997 . 
&quot; The timing and size of the first cut are dependent on metalworkers and employers reaching an accord on renewing a pay contract for 1996-98 , &quot; said Pompeo Pontone , bond market analyst at Credito Italiano . 
analysts said Bank of Italy &apos;s Fazio made this clear last week when he said while great progress had been made in bringing inflation down , &quot; there are risks coming from public finance and labour costs , and monetary policy has to reflect this . 
&quot; The central bank could even cut the discount rate by one percentage point if the long-running dispute in the metal and engineering sector is resolved with a non-inflationary pay rise , &quot; Pontone added .
