State Secretary Murdiono said Indonesia would not approve a plan by the United Nations Human Rights Commission to set up a bureau in Jakarta , newspapers reported on Monday . 
Murdiono was quoted by the Republika newspaper as saying the plan would breach Indonesia &apos;s sovereignty . 
&quot; It is improper to intervene in the problems which are the internal business of a country , &quot; he told reporters in Bandung , the capital of West Java . 
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala-Lasso said last September he was negotiating with Colombia and Indonesia to open monitoring offices in both countries . 
the U.N. Human Rights Commission issued a statement last April expressing &quot; deep concern &quot; over alleged human rights violations in East Timor , which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year in a move not recognised by the United Nations . 
Murdiono was quoted by the Merdeka newspaper as saying that Indonesia upheld human rights , but that the issue should be treated through the country &apos;s own perspective . 
he said Indonesia &apos;s reserved the right to decide how to handle human rights issues and that it was unwilling to be dictated to by other countries . 
he said the United Nations had not formally contacted the Indonesian government on setting up a rights bureau . 
Merdeka gave no further details .
