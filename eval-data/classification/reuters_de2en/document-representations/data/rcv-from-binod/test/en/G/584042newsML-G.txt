French National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin said in an interview on Wednesday that the criteria for a single European currency could not be interpreted literally and the Maastricht treaty would have to be adapted . 
Seguin , a member of President Jacques Chirac &apos;s Gaullist party who campaigned against the treaty in a 1992 referendum , told Paris-Match magazine the economic convergence criteria should be &quot; one reference among others &quot; for deciding who joined the planned single currency . 
&quot; Can you imagine disqualifying a country on the pretext that its deficit is 3.3 percent of gross domestic product and not 3.1 percent , as if it were a game , and as if a currency were strong at three percent and suddenly became weak at 3.3 ? 
&quot; he said . 
opinion polls show Seguin is the most popular candidate for prime minister among conservative voters if the centre-right coalition is re-elected in a May 25-June 1 parliamentary election . 
&quot; The convergence criteria are important but in terms of the trend ... The great European project can &apos;t be reduced to a simple accounting calculation . 
that would be the surest way of making it a failure , &quot; he said . 
Seguin said European Union member governments probably had their last chance in 1998 to put employment at the heart of European integration . 
&quot; Everyone knows very well that the Maastricht treaty cannot be applied to the letter , that it will have to be renegotiated , adapted , completed , spelled out ... for its own salvation and for ours , &quot; he said .
