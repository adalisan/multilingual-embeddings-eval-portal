sterling &apos;s surge above 3.06 marks for the first time since September 1989 has shattered most of the barriers expected to limit its upside and technical analysts are now looking for it to power up towards 3.09 marks . 
&quot; Having broken through monthly trendline resistance and the 1990 high , there is little to hold sterling &apos;s upside now , &quot; said Karen Jones , technical analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston . 
resistance near 3.0880 marks will only temporarily impede sterling &apos;s rally , she said . 
Jones is therefore targeting a move higher to 3.1315 , a 50 percent retracement of sterling &apos;s fall from 4.0949 marks to its record low of 2.1683 . 
sterling , which rose as high as 3.0603 marks overnight , was at 3.0573 / 78 at 0740 GMT from 3.0425 / 35 late Tuesday in Europe . 
cable was at $ 1.6784 / 95 from $ 1.6753 / 58 yesterday . 
levels which acted as resistance until yesterday , such as 3.0360 and 3.0330 marks , are now expected to provide sterling with good support in the days ahead , analysts said . 
&quot; Sterling / mark should consolidate a touch , but 3.09 seems open with risk brought up to the 3.03 zone from 2.98 , &quot; said Gerry Celaya , senior technical analyst at American Express Bank . 
analysts are also expecting cable to push higher in the coming days . 
cable has been caught in a range of $ 1.6640 to $ 1.6825 for the past week . 
its ability to hold above $ 1.67 yesterday is , however , encouraging analysts to look for it to break higher . 
&quot; Cable effectively negated downside pressure after support at $ 1.6690 / 6705 held yesterday , &quot; said Jones at CSFB . 
&quot; The pressure is building for a break on the upside . 
sterling will encounter initial resistance at $ 1.6840 / 50 but a break above here will clear the way for a move up to the six-month high of $ 1.6986 set on July 11 .
