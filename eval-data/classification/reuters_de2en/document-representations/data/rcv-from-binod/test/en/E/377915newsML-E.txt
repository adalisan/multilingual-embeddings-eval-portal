Zimbabwe scrapped import duty on capital goods on Friday and announced deep cuts in tax on industrial spares in a new tariff regime it said was aimed at boosting its sickly manufacturing and industrial sectors . 
finance Minister Herbert Murerwa told a news conference that the long-awaited tariffs , which were heartily welcomed by commerce and industry , would take effect from March 1 . 
but he said the new taxes would not apply in cases where the southern African country has preferential trading pacts , including South Africa with which it is negotiating a crucial economic agreement . 
duties on raw materials for manufacturing and on books have been slashed to five percent from 40 percent ; on spares to 15 percent from up to 56 percent and on partly processed inputs to 15 percent from up to 55 percent . 
import tax on capital goods was cut to zero from a 0-25 percent pegging and also to zero on goods for the blind from 10 percent , although the government retained a 20 percent import duty on other medical supllies . 
Murerwa said finished imported goods would attract duty of between 40 to 85 percent from 0-85 percent , with the highest tariffs applying to electronics , batteries , luggageware , textile and clothing .
