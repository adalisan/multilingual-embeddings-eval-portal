the Army on Wednesday began deploying more than 3,000 troops to the Gulf as part of the Clinton administration &apos;s latest moves to guard against further military action by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . 
a first group of 219 soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division headed from Fort Hood army base in central Texas to Kuwait on a commercial jet after saying goodbye to their families . 
defence officials said a C-5 military cargo plane would follow in the afternoon with 73 soldiers and key satellite equipment on board and two flights early on Thursday would take 700 more troops . 
Lt. Col. Randy Schoel said the staggered deployment of about 3,000 troops from two battalions at Fort Hood , the U.S. Army &apos;s largest base , would be completed over two or three days , with each flight to Kuwait taking from 17 to 22 hours . 
&quot; They are ready , they are prepared and they are excited , &quot; said Maj. Mary Ann Cummings as the first group took off . 
she said almost all their heavy equipment was in place in Kuwait . 
defence Secretary William Perry said on Tuesday the deployment was to augment enforcement of &quot; Operation Southern Watch , &quot; which is the patrolling by air of southern Iraq . 
&quot; ... We will not tolerate any threatening actions against our air crews and ... any that they take we will respond ( to ) very sharply , &quot; Perry told reporters . 
but he said Iraq had in recent days stopped threatening allied warplane , reducing the chances that further U.S. military action would be taken soon . 
the U.S. military launched cruise missile strikes against air defence facilities in southern Iraq two weeks ago after Iraq moved against Kurds in the north . 
President Bill Clinton said he ordered the new troop deployment last weekend . 
the formal mission of the Fort Hood troops was to provide training for Kuwaiti forces but officials said they could be used in any new military action against Iraq . 
about 1,200 ground troops were already in Kuwait before the latest Gulf crisis began and they have stayed in place . 
it was Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait that sparked the 1991 Gulf War . 
Clinton , who also ordered the expansion of a &quot; no-fly zone &quot; excluding Iraqi warplanes in southern Iraq , said on Tuesday his policy was designed to &quot; keep Saddam Hussein in a box and limit his ability to threaten his neighbours . 
the Fort Hood troops had an emotional farewell with family members at dawn , with soldiers hugging spouses and children before being moved to a holding area and boarding their plane .

the hardest part is not knowing when he &apos;ll be back , &quot; said his wife , Michelle . 
about 45,000 troops are stationed at Fort Hood , which lies just outside Killeen in central Texas , about 120 miles ( 190 km ) south of Dallas .
