implied volatilities for U.S. Treasury bond options remained under pressure as the underlying bond market refused to move away from the center of recent narrow ranges , dealers said . 
June T-bond futures , which have traded within one point of 110-00 all month except for a brief dip to 108-30 / 32 on May 8 , rebounded to above 110-00 after slipping earlier to a low of 109-12 / 32 in a session driven by economic data . 
&quot; It &apos;s getting pretty boring , &quot; a brokerage T-bond trader at the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) said . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t look like the market &apos;s going to do much before FOMC . 
the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) is due to meet next Tuesday . 
implied volatility for July T-bond futures options fell a quarter point from Wednesday to about 8.4 percent and September was also a touch lower at about 8.6 percent . 
traders said there was little interest to roll over positions in June options , which expire at noon on Friday and that the bid / ask spread in June had widened somewhat . 
according to the CBOT , open interest in June calls declined by only 864 contracts to 312,753 and that in puts increased by 3,111 to 283,627 on Wednesday . 
bonds were hit by a higher-than-expected core April consumer price index ( CPI ) in early trade , but bounced back on a weak reading in the Philadelphia Fed business index . 
core CPI , excluding food and energy , was up 0.3 percent in April against Wall Street forecast of a 0.2 percent gain and March &apos;s 0.1 percent rise . 
the overall CPI was up 0.1 percent , in line with the market &apos;s expectations . 
the Philadelphia Fed index fell to 1.6 in May from 5.7 in April . 
with even the most bearish people expecting only a mild credit tightening for the current economic cycle , traders said the question now was how soon the Fed would act , if it does . 
&quot; There really isn &apos;t any conviction about what the Fed is going to do , &quot; said a Eurodollar trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) , adding that that had moved the focus to short-dated options . 
if rates were not raised next Tuesday , the Eurodollar curve would likely reclaim some of the tightening built in already , especially at the very front end and the 1998 quarters , traders said . 
one house was seen buying 4,000 contracts of short-June 93.75 calls against June 1998 futures . 
short Junes are options expiring next month but are priced off June 1998 futures . 
the same firm was said to have bought 93.75 / 94.00 July put spread in a two-by-one ratio . 
July options settle against September futures but have higher gamma acceleration than September options . 
implied volatilities for September and December Eurodollar futures options were off late-morning lows but were still a touch softer at around 9.1 and 11.2 percent .
