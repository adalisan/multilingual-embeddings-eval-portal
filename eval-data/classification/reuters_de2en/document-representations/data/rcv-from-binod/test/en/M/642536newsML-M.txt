LIFFE white sugar futures ended Friday weaker as the market corrected down after the fund-inspired rally earlier in the week , traders said . 
August fell 70 cents to end at $ 326.00 and October was down $ 1.30 at $ 316.00 . 
volume reached 2,445 lots , boosted by crosses on August . 
Aug / Oct spread widened slightly to $ 10 . 
traders said the perception of seasonal tightness into Europe &apos;s summer months should keep nearby prices underpinned although sell orders at $ 330 and above would continue to cap August gains . 
London &apos;s perceived strength should make the Aug / July arbitrage versus New York a buy at current levels as the New York market is expected to weaken . 
Fund players in the raws still had to liquidate hefty long July positions before expiry on June 30 and the nearby arbitrage was already attracting sellers keen for quick daily profits , they said . 
in fundamental news , Cuba ended its 1996 / 97 sugar cane harvest on Friday with production lower than originally forecast by authorities . 
experts put the harvest at around 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes . 
officials had in December predicted a modest improvement over the 1995 / 96 harvet of 4.45 million .
