Kabul University re-opened on Sunday without women teachers or students , and suffering from an acute shortage of funds and teachers . 
the university was closed in September when the purist Islamic Taleban took over Kabul . 
for almost four years the university was on the front line between Afghanistan &apos;s warring factions : its facilities were destroyed or looted , most of its teaching staff fled abroad , and the young men who scurried between its buildings were carrying Kalashnikov rifles rather than books . 
since the front line moved away two years ago , attempts have been made to rehabilitate the institution , but it is still facing numerous problems . 
the re-opening ceremony was held in the university &apos;s auditorium . 
outside , a young bearded fighter armed with a bayonet and a light machine gun guarded the door ; inside , a hole blasted in the roof by a rocket dripped water on the audience and power for the amplification system was provided by an ageing Soviet-built generator . 
for most of the speakers , Islam seemed of greater concern than education . 
&quot; Even if a man is a doctor or an engineer , if his acts are not based on Islam and Islamic law , he is not a human being . 
&quot; Abul Shoukoor Haqqani , the deputy Minister for Religious Trust , told the gathering . 
however , for the rector of the university , the primary worry was to keep it operating . 
&quot; We need immediate help to keep the university functioning , &quot; said the rector Amir Shah Hassanyar after the ceremony . 
&quot; We need stationery , food for the student dormitories , qualified teachers and the money to pay them . 
&quot; he said . 
Hassanyar told reporters that 14 faculties would be re-opening with 300 teachers . 
&quot; Fourteen faculties will be re-opening ; in total 52 departments . 
we had 360 teachers but 60 of them were women , so we now have 300 . 
&quot; he said . 
the Taleban have banned women from working except in the medical sector . 
female students have also been banned from educational establishments . 
the Taleban Minister of Higher Education said that the ban on women teachers and students was temporary , but that they would only be allowed back into certain faculties . 
&quot; The main problem is a lack of resources . 
we need separate facilities for girls and we do not have enough women teachers , but if we get the resources women &apos;s faculties in certain subjects will be allowed to open , &quot; said Maulawi Hamdullah Noumani . 
&quot; Although they may not be allowed to study engineering for example , they will be allowed to study medicine , home economics and teaching , &quot; he said . 
according to Hassanyar , women made up 4,000 of the university &apos;s 10,000-strong student body before it was closed . 
&quot; In September we had 10,000 students , 6,000 boys and 4,000 girls . 
we expect about 5,000 students to come back , &quot; he said . 
Hassanyar also said that finding and retaining qualified teaching staff was proving difficult . 
&quot; More than 100,000 Afghan intellectuals have fled abroad in the last 20 years . 
it is difficult to find 100 people in Afghanistan with a masters degree or a PhD . 
&quot; said Hassanyar , who himself has a doctorate in Ecology from Colorado University in the U.S. 
&quot; I am trying to keep in touch with the intellectuals who have stayed . 
I see little chance of those who fled to the United States and Germany returning in the short term , and if those that remain leave , it would be a catastrophe for Afghanistan , &quot; he said . 
he said salaries for teaching staff ranged between 700,000 Afghanis ( $ 35 ) a month for himself to 200,000 Afghanis ( $ 10 ) for an ordinary teacher . 
&quot; For many teachers , their salary is equal to the price of one sack of flour . 
most of them have to take second and third jobs . 
also many of them have not been out of Afghanistan for 20 years and are totally unaware of developments that have taken place in the world , &quot; he said .
