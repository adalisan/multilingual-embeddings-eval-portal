for Britain &apos;s Labour Party , the vision has changed beyond recognition . 
before the 1983 election its programme called for &quot; an expansion of common ownership substantial enough to give the community decisive power over the commanding heights of the economy &quot; . 
labour goes into Thursday &apos;s election as a moderate party prepared to accept the privatisation of key assets , dedicated to tight spending limits and no tax rises for the next five years . 
a call to scrap Britain &apos;s nuclear weapons , which also figured prominently in the 1983 manifesto , was defeated at the party conference , despite the presence of many Labour radicals . 
from being a rabble on the brink of extinction as a serious political force , Labour has become a disciplined group looking to establishing itself as Britain &apos;s natural party of government . 
the &quot; winter of discontent &quot; which followed Labour prime minister James Callaghan &apos;s decision to delay a general election until the spring of 1979 was a harbinger of the party &apos;s troubles . 
rubbish piled up in the streets and the dead were left unburied as public sector trade unions struggled to widen a breach in the wages policy introduced by the government in a bid to curb spiralling inflation . 
when Margaret Thatcher &apos;s Conservatives swept to power on a tide of public revulsion for Labour , the radical Left began to consolidate the gains it had already been making in the party . 
Callaghan was replaced by Michael Foot , a veteran with impeccable socialist credentials whose past disrespect for party discipline , and image as a bookish , other-worldly intellectual , made him an unlikely party leader . 
the still more radical Tony Benn , vocal advocate of changes to party rules to boost the power of leftist activists , came within an ace of being elected Foot &apos;s deputy . 
some felt Foot and Benn were what Labour now deserved . 
right-wing Labour member of parliament Austin Mitchell described the attitude of left-wingers at that time as &quot; To lead was to betray . 
leadership itself was an anti-social act , an indictable offence . 
leaders would sell out -- unless they were stopped . 
Mitchell stayed with Labour , but four key figures did not . 
former finance minister Roy Jenkins returned from a spell in Brussels as president of the European Economic Community &apos;s Commission , to lead a spectacular Labour schism . 
with fellow former cabinet ministers Shirley Williams , David Owen and Bill Rodgers , and a gaggle of lesser MPs , he formed the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) , which immediately entered into a political and electoral alliance with the centrist Liberals . 
Jenkins later wrote in his memoirs that it was &quot; impossible in my view for any self-respecting social democrat to fight the 1983 general election as a Labour candidate except with his head down , his coat collar turned up and in dark spectacles &quot; . 
at the 1983 election , the SDP-Liberal Alliance came desperately close to overtaking Labour in terms of the national vote -- they won 26 percent to Labour &apos;s 28 . 
although Labour still had 209 seats in the 651-member House of Commons , in terms of votes per candidate , the result was its worst since 1900 , when the party was in its infancy . 
a speech to the 1985 party conference by Neil Kinnock , the centre-left leader who succeeded Foot , marked the beginning of a return from what many saw as insanity . 
he rounded on the Militant tendency , a far-left group which had begun to infiltrate Labour , saying it had influenced the council leadership in the northern port city of Liverpool to make unrealistic pledges , eventually resulting in it having to sack hundreds of workers . 
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happens with impossible promises , &quot; a flushed Kinnock declared in an electrifying speech . 
&quot; You start with far-fetched resolutions . 
they are then pickled into a rigid dogma , a code , and you go through the years sticking to that , outdated , misplaced , irrelevant . 
the Guardian newspaper said Kinnock &apos;s was &quot; the bravest and most important speech by a Labour leader in over a generation &quot; . 
in the 1987 election , campaigning under the slogan &quot; Investing in People &quot; , Labour won an extra 20 Commons seats and re-established itself as Britain &apos;s unchallenged second party . 
although a few crew members had gone overboard , the party had weathered the storm . 
the 1992 election manifesto , seeking an &quot; enabling state &quot; , contained not a single pledge for the return to public ownership of any of the industries privatised by the Conservatives over the years . 
labour came desperately close to winning in 1992 , the Conservatives getting an overall parliamentary majority of just 21 . 
but there was still one albatross round Labour &apos;s neck -- its image as a high-tax , high-spending party . 
a &quot; shadow budget &quot; , seen as having too low a tax threshold , announced by finance spokesman John Smith was widely blamed for the defeat . 
despite this , Smith took over as leader , pushing through constitutional reforms to curb the influence of trade unions through a one-member one-vote system in key internal elections . 
his sudden death in 1994 opened the way for Blair , who quickly challenged the left &apos;s most precious totem -- the clause of the party constitution declaring its aim to secure for workers &quot; the full fruits of their labour ... on the basis of common ownership &quot; . 
when he succeeded in getting Clause Four scrapped , Blair hailed his victory as &quot; a defining moment in our history &quot; . 
his other achievement was to lay the ghost of the high-tax image , instructing his finance spokesman Gordon Brown to be sparing in his spending commitments and to declare an aim to reduce income tax on the average family . 
in 1995 , when Labour fought the key Littleborough and Saddleworth parliamentary by-election , it mounted sustained attacks on the Liberal Democrats , heirs to the SDP-Liberal alliance , for their spending pledges . 
Liberal Democrat candidate Chris Davies was pilloried for his calls for more cash for education and welfare and also for an inquiry into the legalisation of cannabis . 
on the day after Davies scored a narrow win , his supporters drove a bus around the constituency thanking people for their support . 
as they passed Labour campaign headquarters , they sang a new version of Labour &apos;s traditional song , &quot; The Red Flag &quot; . 
&quot; The people &apos;s flag is slightly pink , it &apos;s not as red as people think , &quot; ran the refrain . 
the wheel had come full circle since the SDP &apos;s founders quit Labour for being too left-wing .
