Sierra Leone &apos;s president , Ahmad Tejan Kabbah , has accused the rebel Revolutionary United Front of delaying the peace process by failing to nominate members of a joint monitoring group and demobilisation commission . 
Kabbah told an annual military parade in the capital Freetown on Friday : &quot; The RUF has still not named representatives on the joint monitoring group and the committee for demobilisation and resettlement , thereby holding up the establishment of encampment zones and the process of encampment and disarmament . 
both sides have denounced ceasefire breaches . 
Kabbah , who came to power in March 1996 after multi-party elections ended four years of army rule , signed a peace deal with rebel leader Foday Sankoh in Ivory Coast on November 30 . 
five years of civil war have killed more than 10,000 people .
