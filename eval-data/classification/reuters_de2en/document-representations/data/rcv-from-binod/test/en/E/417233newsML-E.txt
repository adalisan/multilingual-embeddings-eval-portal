Kenya on Tuesday posted its gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth at 4.8 percent in 1996 , lower than the forecast 6.0 percent and 4.9 percent in 1995 . 
the Central Bank of Kenya , in a report issued in Nairobi , also forecast economic growth at 6.0 percent in 1997 and 7.0 percent in 1998 . 
the finance ministry has previously forecast 1997 growth at 7.0 percent and 1998 growth at 8.0 percent . 
at a news briefing , Central Bank Governor Micah Cheserem hinted that because of a drought that President Daniel arap Moi has already declared a national disaster , the GDP growth estimate for 1997 was unlikely to be met . 
&quot; People have already started talking about GDP growth of just 4-5 percent , &quot; Cheserem told reporters . 
Cheserem added that despite the lower-than-expected GDP growth , the economy was healthy and GDP growth was picking up from comparative depressing figures such as 0.2 percent in 1993 and 0.5 percent in 1992 . 
&quot; If our objective had been to run down the economy in the first half of this decade , which it was not , then we had succeeded by 1993 , &quot; the central bank said in a report . 
Cheserem said real interest rates were still very high but the central bank was determined to reduce them through a combination of monetary and fiscal policies . 
interest rates on the 91-day main category of government treasury bills is now around 21 percent . 
base lending rates in commercial banks ranges from 24 percent to up to 35 percent .
