explosives found near Sofia airport last week were not intended for an attack on the Bulgarian and Romanian presidents and had probably simply been discarded to avoid police checks , the interior ministry said on Tuesday . 
police found 700 grammes ( 1-1 / 2 lbs ) of plastic-wrapped TNT explosive in an electrical junction box at a road junction near the airport on April 30 , shortly before Romanian President Emil Constantinescu arrived for talks . 
&quot; All junctions and drainage ditches are routinely checked before a government official passes by so if anybody was seriously planning an attempt on the lives of the presidents he would not have chosen such a place to plant a bomb , &quot; Interior Ministry Secretary Nikolai Radulov told a news conference . 
he said the bomb had a mechanical detonator and could only have been set off by hand . 
&quot; The location of the explosive and its contents showed that there was no technical possibility of threatening the lives of the presidents and the only victim of a possible explosion would have been a potential assassin , &quot; he said . 
Radulov said police had found no evidence to support media speculation that the bomb could have been an attack on Constantinescu by Turkish Kurds inspired by strict Romanian measures against the Kurdistan Workers &apos; Party ( PKK ) . 
&quot; It is not realistic to think that the PKK is involved in any way in this incident as it is not operating in Bulgaria , &quot; Radulov said . 
bombs are frequently used by Bulgaria &apos;s shady business groups to settle internal quarrels . 
&quot; We have more reason to believe that the explosive was carried for other purposes and the possible perpetrator was simply scared by the presence of the police officers who were there to escort the two presidents and got rid of the bomb by hiding it in the electrical junction box , &quot; Radulov said .
