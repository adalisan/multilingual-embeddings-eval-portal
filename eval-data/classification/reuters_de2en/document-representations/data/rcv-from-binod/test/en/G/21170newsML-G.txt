fourteen political associations want to be registered as political parties , Nigerian electoral authorities on Thursday after receiving merger applications from seven of the 18 political associations . 
&quot; We have received papers from seven out of the 18 associations indicating their intentions to merge into three different political associations , &quot; Musa Adamu , Electoral Commission Director of Research , told reporters in the capital Abuja . 
&quot; We assure all involved we will be fair in taking a final decision on registration of all associations wanting to be political parties . 
all political associations should be ready to accept the outcome of our verification exercise , &quot; he added . 
the deadline of application for mergers was on Thursday . 
the electoral commission said it would announce the mergers that had been approved not later than August 31 . 
two weeks ago , the electoral commission extended by a month the timetable for registering political parties , saying this was to allow them to merge . 
until now , 18 political associations were seeking to register as political parties to contest power under military ruler General Sani Abacha &apos;s transition to a civil rule programme . 
verification of claims made by the political associations would be conducted between September 2 and 17 , the electoral commission said , adding that names of political associations approved for registration as political parties would be revealed by the end of September . 
the associations were given stringent qualifying criteria for registration , including evidence of having a million card-carrying members in Africa &apos;s most populous nation of 100 million people . 
last month they submitted truckloads of documents to the electoral commission claiming to have met the requirements . 
political parties have been banned in Nigeria since Abacha seized power in November 1993 . 
his government has promised to allow those that meet the criteria , meant to rule out ethnic-based parties , to compete in a series of elections starting from the end of this year to 1998 , when they say democracy will be fully restored . 
Nigeria has been in political crisis since 1993 , when a previous military government annulled the elections that would have ended 10 years of army rule . 
it has been under fire from Western countries for its lack of democracy and human rights abuse since then .
