commodity prices in Australian dollar terms fell during September , according to the international commodity price review , released by the National Farmers &apos; Federation ( NFF ) and Dresdner Australia International . 
NFF &apos;s director of economic policy , Todd Ritchie , said the renewed Iraqi conflict had provoked a surge in crude oil prices during the month , but the rises masked a decline in the price of metals and lower prices for most agricultural commodities . 
&quot; The conflict also halted the planned sale from Australia of one million tonnes of wheat per year , which would have been allowed under the &apos; oil for aid &apos; programme , &quot; he said . 
rural prices in special drawing rights ( SDR ) terms increased marginally by 0.1 percent during September and were now 5.6 percent higher than a year ago , Ritchie said . 
however , in Australian dollar terms , prices fell by 1.8 percent during the month , he said . 
beef prices improved slightly during September but prices fell for sorghum , barley , wheat , rice , cotton and wool , he said . 
wheat prices continued to soften following a number of developments during September , including an upward revision of the estimated global wheat crop and the news that the European Union had reintroduced wheat export subsidies , he said . 
wool prices have also weakened since the end of August , although there is a more optimistic outlook for demand in the first half of 1997 , and beef prices are expected to remain relatively weak in the short-term , Ritchie said . 
Dresdner chief economist Rob Henderson said the SDR commodity index rose 1.2 percent during September but in Australian dollar terms it fell by 0.7 percent due to a stronger A $ during the month . 
&quot; The strong appreciation over the past 12 months has resulted in the index dropping to a level 3.8 percent lower than a year ago , &quot; Henderson said . 
improving prospects for growth in Japan and Western Europe , combined with a strong and resilient U.S. economy , suggested higher prices for the mining sector into 1997 , Henderson said .
