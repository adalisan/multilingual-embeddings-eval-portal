the U.S. embassy in Tokyo said on Monday that North Korea will release American Carl Hunziker , who has been detained in the communist state for three months on espionage charges . 
&quot; Congressman Bill Richardson will return ( to Tokyo ) from North Korea on Tuesday with Mr Evan Carl Hunziker on a U.S. military aircraft ... , &quot; the embassy said in a statement . 
Richardson had earlier flown from Tokyo to the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Monday in the hope of bringing back Hunziker . 
Hunziker , 26 , was arrested on August 24 after crossing the Yalu River from China into North Korea and accused of being a U.S. spy . 
Hunziker &apos;s family has denied the charge , saying he is a missionary . 
Richardson , a Democrat from New Mexico , was to act as an unofficial U.S. envoy in negotiations with North Korean officials . 
U.S. State Department officials described Richardson &apos;s visit as &quot; an important humanitarian mission &quot; , although he would be accompanied by a U.S. State Department official acting as an &quot; escort officer &quot; .
