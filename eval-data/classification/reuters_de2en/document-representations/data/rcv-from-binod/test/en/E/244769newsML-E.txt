a major world trade conference opened on Monday to ringing calls to avoid North-South division and to create more liberalised global commerce that would benefit the poor and make life safer for everyone . 
Renato Ruggiero , director-general of the World Trade Organisation , set the tone by urging the first ministerial conference since the WTO was founded two years ago to agree on key issues despite their political sensitivity . 
the Geneva-based organisation &apos;s 128 member states disagree over an Information Technology Agreement ( ITA ) and the question of whether labour standards should be subject to WTO rules . 
Ruggiero said the draft ITA , which seeks to eliminate tariffs on an estimated $ 1 trillion worth of annual world trade in computer and telecommunications products , was critical . 
&quot; In the economy of the 21st Century , knowledge , like water , will be an essential resource , &quot; he said . 
deep disagreements persist over the ITA -- what it should include , how far it should go and how soon it should come into force . 
the United States is pushing for an ITA pact this week to cut tariffs by 2000 , and Charlene Barshefsky , the Acting U.S. Trade Representative , put Washington &apos;s agenda in stark terms . 
she told the conference that Washington , which accounts for 50 percent of world telecommunications revenue , &quot; cannot and we will not settle for a situation where we are unable to operate in the other half of the world &apos;s markets &quot; . 
the United States also faced opposition on the divisive issue of linking trade and labour standards -- from some major Western nations and from WTO hosts Singapore . 
trade ministers from Britain , Australia and Germany said the WTO should not broach issues such as child and slave labour . 
pressure groups on the sidelines said it was not true that trade liberalisation was good for all and opposed introducing labour standards in the WTO . 
developing nations see such links as a western attempt to take away their advantage of cheap labour . 
Singapore &apos;s Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pulled no punches in warning the big powers not to push the emerging economies too hard to reduce some of their distinctive advantages .. 
&quot; It is clear that low labour costs are a legitimate comparative advantage for developing countires and that labour standards should not be used as a disguised protectionist measure , &quot; he said . 
in his inaugural speech , Goh set up a broader canvas for the week-long meeting . 
he told the trade officials that liberalisation meant more trade , more investment , more peace . 
&quot; This will mean even higher living standards of living for all . 
growing economic prosperity will in turn lead to greater international security and stability . 
this is not fantasy , but a vision within reach , &quot; he declared . 
the United States and Europe raised their voices to urge determination to narrow differences between North and South , as well as North and North , that threaten the free trade goal . 
the WTO meeting , which seeks to draw up a blueprint for global trade in the next century , should send a clear message to the world , Ruggiero said . 
&quot; It should be a firm message about our determination to fight the marginalisation of people and regions , and about the power of trade to promote growth which allows governments to address problems of distribution , &quot; Ruggiero said . 
he signalled that trade in information technology products , which the WTO says outstrips world exports of agricultural products , would probably dominate the week &apos;s meetings . 
the USTR &apos;s Barshefsky said the ITA would help to put less costly technologies in the hands of businesses around the globe , making them more competitive . 
&quot; That &apos;s why we must reach agreement this week , &quot; Barshefsky told ministers . 
&quot; remaining issues are ripe for decision . 
we have an historic opportunity to eliminate tariffs on these products . 
we must seize it . 
the European Union differs with Washington over just what products should be covered by the pact , arguing that it is partly designed to favour U.S. goods and does not take EU interests fully into account . 
EU Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said the Singapore meeting would be judged a failure if it did not make progress on ITA . 
&quot; I should not have to say that we all have to make a further effort . 
but we do . 
if we do not make substantial progress on both issues this week , with new offers tabled , then our meeting will not be the big success we all want , &quot; he told ministers .
