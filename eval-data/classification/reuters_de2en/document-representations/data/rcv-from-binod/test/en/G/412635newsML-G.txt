Spain were trailing Belgium 1-0 in their Fed Cup tennis world group one match on Saturday after Arantxa Sanchez Vicario crashed to a shock 6-3 7-6 defeat by Belgian substitute Els Callens . 
it was the second loss to a Belgian in two months for the former world number one , who clumsily hit a forehand long on the second matchpoint for Callens , who took the tie-break 7-4 . 
Sanchez Vicario had been keen to avenge her defeat to another Belgian , Dominique Van roost , in the third round of this year &apos;s Australian Open . 
but Van roost pulled out on Friday because of the abdomen injury which had forced her to retire in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open , and was replaced by Callens . 
Spain have won the Cup four times in the past six years including victories over the United States in 1991 , 1994 and 1995 . 
they are also without Conchita Martinez , who formed with Sanchez Vicario the most successful doubles combination in Cup history . 
Martinez has tendinitis in her right shoulder .
