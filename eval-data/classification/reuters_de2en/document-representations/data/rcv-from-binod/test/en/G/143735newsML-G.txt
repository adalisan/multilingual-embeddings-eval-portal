a former Cuban Interior Ministry official pleaded not guilty on Friday to a single air-piracy charge involving the hijacking in July of a small Cuban commercial plane . 
an attorney for Jose Leonardo Fernandez Pupo , who has been charged with seizing control of the plane at gunpoint and forcing it to land at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba , entered the plea on his client &apos;s behalf . 
the Cuban Aero taxi departed Bayamo , Cuba on July 7 and was scheduled to fly to three Cuban cities . 
but it was diverted to the U.S. base , where Fernandez Pupo sought asylum . 
he was flown to a Washington , D.C. jail on Thursday to face the criminal charges . 
he had been in custody at the base . 
Cuba has demanded that the United States return him . 
a federal prosecutor argued that he should be kept in jail without bond because he poses a risk of flight and has no ties to the community . 
the judge agreed , ruling that Fernandez Pupo must stay in jail at least until another hearing next week .
