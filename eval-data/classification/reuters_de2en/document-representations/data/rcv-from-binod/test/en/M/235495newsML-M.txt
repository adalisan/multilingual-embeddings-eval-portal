under selling pressure from all quarters and unwanted by fabricators and speculators alike , the price of gold slumped to three-year lows on Tuesday . 
and gold &apos;s prospects were unlikely to get any cheerier by the year &apos;s end , analysts said . 
&quot; In the short term , prices will slowly erode away , and rallies will be increasingly sold into . 
we &apos;re definitely heading south , &quot; said metals analyst Ted Arnold of Merrill Lynch . 
Bullion fixed at $ 367.40 an ounce on Tuesday afternoon , the lowest fixing since November 1993 , after slipping beneath the psychological $ 370 an ounce level overnight . 
by 1725 GMT , the bullion price had declined even further to $ 366.25 per ounce . 
interest looked dangerously thin on with $ 365 then $ 360 as the next potential levels where buyers could be attracted , according to analyst Karen Jones of Credit Suisse . 
prices have been declining steadily since a blistering rally pushed them to a peak of $ 418 an ounce in February . 
but over the past two weeks gold &apos;s descent has speeded up dramatically amid overwhelmingly bearish market sentiment . 
dealers and analysts have noted that mining houses , particularly in major gold producer Australia , have been in a panic to sell their output forward and lock in prices as the gold price sinks lower . 
persistent market talk that a central bank has been selling some of its gold reserves has also helped depress the mood . 
&quot; Institutions ( like central banks ) are not in the business of looking at price charts . 
if they have business they go ahead and do it , which makes it difficult for professionals to gauge the market , &quot; a London-based bullion dealer said . 
surging stock markets and a stronger dollar have also discouraged investors from buying gold and big investment funds are betting on the gold price sinking lower , analysts said . 
despite the plunge -- gold has shed some $ 15 since mid-November -- traditional buyers have held off to see how low prices will sink . 
&quot; This latest dive looks overdone , and there could be a slight recovery . 
but fundamentally I don &apos;t see anything that &apos;s going to push gold back up to the $ 380s , &quot; said market analyst Kevin crisp of JP Morgan . 
over the next few months , physical buying was likely to emerge as jewellers restock after the winter buying season for Christmas , Chinese New Year and Ramadan , he said . 
&quot; But if we have further weakness , the real test for the market will be whether good physical demand is ignited by lower prices , &quot; crisp added . 
underlying the bearish sentiment is concern in the market about gold &apos;s future role in European central banks , particularly in the rush to comply with European Monetary Union criteria . 
if central banks decided to strip gold of its traditional role as the ultimate store of value and start mobilising their reserves , the market fears it will be flooded with fresh , abundant supplies . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of uncertainty in the market , and unfortunately for gold , it &apos;s all negative , &quot; crisp said . 
the other precious metals -- silver , platinum and palladium -- have followed gold lower . 
silver , at around $ 4.70 an ounce , is trading at 18-month lows , while the other two white metals are at three-year lows .
