losers outnumbered gainers on the Budapest Stock Exchange on Thursday weighed down by a weaker dollar , traders said , adding that strong demand in MOL kept its price relatively stable . 
&quot; These days the dollar &apos;s weakening weighs more than the Dow &apos;s fall , &quot; said Kalman Schuszter of New York broker Budapest . 
at midday on Thursday the forint stood at 181.50 to the dollar , half a forint firmer than at Wednesday &apos;s close . 
oil company MOL once again overshadowed most of the market with over one and a half million shares traded , including agency crosses . 
&quot; Foreign investors , in addition to domestic ones , continue to buy MOL , &quot; Schuszter said . 
&quot; Huge demand for the stock prevents it from ( major ) falls . 
but analysts said the share might lose ground once its domestic offer , starting on May 12 , is completed as some local clients might decide to dump the shares to lock in profits , stemming from between the 2,970 forint issue price and the higher market price . 
&quot; I think MOL might retreat , mainly on the domestic market there will be investors who sell it quickly after the purchase ( in the domestic offer ) , &quot; said Tommy Erdei , analyst of ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett . 
pharmaceuticals Richter continued its rally hitting a new record and surprising some traders who said Richter &apos;s market was a little overheated shortly before its share issue , despite strong January-March earnings . 
&quot; This price is surprising because the company will issue shares in May , &quot; one trader said earlier . 
but Erdei said Richter &apos;s price is justified and this is reflected by its popularity among investors . 
&quot; Its first quarter earningsexceeded expectations , it &apos;s a stable , quickly-growing company , &quot; he said . 
&quot; On longer-term TVK must rise as perhaps they had the best results so far ( among companies that released their Q1 earnings report , &quot; he said . 
elsewhere on the market , curtain maker Gardenia dipped below its issue price for the first time since its listing on April 14 , before recovering to close at 1,490 forints , down 240 . 
it fell to 1,450 , below the 1,465 forint issue price . 
tile manufacturer Zalakeramia suffered steep early losses , although later regained some of them , triggered by the fact that its price was adjusting to the issue price in a private placement , traders said . 
&quot; Zalakeramia was falling because of the ( lower ) issue price but investors have begun to buy so I don &apos;t think that would be a long-lasting fall , &quot; one trader said earlier . 
but Erdei said Zalakeramia was undervalued at current price .
