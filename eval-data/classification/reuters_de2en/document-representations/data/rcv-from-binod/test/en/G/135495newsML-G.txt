an Egyptian government newspaper resumed its campaign against Israeli leaders on Tuesday , saying some members in the Jewish state &apos;s government were behaving like criminal gang members . 
the newspaper al-Akhbar said in a frontpage editorial the past week of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over the West Bank town of Hebron showed Israel was trying to circumvent old peace agreements . 
&quot; In spite of the arrogance and impudence of ( Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ) Netanyahu ... , the real factor influencing his attitude is the game of one-upmanship he is playing with the extremists in his government , whose behaviour is no different from that of members of criminal gangs , &quot; it said . 
the editorial said Israeli intransigence and haggling had killed the hope that Israel and the Palestinians would agree on an Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron . 
PLO negotiators stormed out of talks with Israel on Monday night in protest at the attitude of Israeli delegates , which they described as that of &quot; occupiers toward the occupied &quot; . 
Al-Akhbar said it expected Israel would do everything possible to thwart French attempts to move Middle East peace talks forward . 
&quot; It does not see this ( French ) role as compatible with its aggressive and expansionist tendencies and its desperate attempts to obstruct the peace process , &quot; it said . 
Israeli leaders have rejected French President Jacques Chirac &apos;s proposal that Europe act as joint sponsor of the peace process , alongside the United States . 
&quot; The only explanation for this ( attempt to exclude Europe ) is fear that Europe is inclined towards justice and truly desires to achieve peace in the Middle East , ... which Israel sees as an enemy to its dreams and to its strategy based on aggression and expansion , &quot; it added .
