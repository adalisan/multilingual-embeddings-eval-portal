an inquiry is being launched after a leading director of the Brazilian national soccer confederation ( CBF ) resigned amid allegations of corruption . 
a scandal erupted after the Globo television station played a recording of a telephone conversation which it said was between Ivens Mendes , head of the CBF &apos;s refereeing commission , and the president of Atletico Paranaense . 
in the conversation , the man identified as Mendes offered to ask a referee to give Atletico a helping hand in a COPA Brasil match they were to play at home to Vasco da Gama . 
the man identified as Mendes said : &quot; I need you to send me 25,000 Real ( about $ 23,600 ) ... 
&quot; Tell your players to mark ( Vasco da Gama striker ) Edmundo closely , he gets angry easily . 
the man identified by Globo as Atletico president Mario Celso Petraglia was heard to reply that Mendes should get in touch with his ( Petralgia &apos;s ) secretary who would &quot; look after it . 
Atletico won the second round , first leg match 3-1 . 
Edmundo , who has a long record of being sent off , and Atletico defender Andrei were dismissed in the first half for fighting . 
Edmundo said of his dismissal : &quot; It was a huge injustice . 
Globo television alleged that Mendes , who resigned on Wednesday claiming he had been threatened , is seeking election to the Brazilian Congress and used money sent to him by club directors to help his election campaign . 
Globo said it been sent the tape anonymously . 
Mendes admitted he had received money but claimed it was all above board : &quot; What is wrong with me as a Brazilian citizen ... who is trying to start a political career accepting help from my friends ? 
&quot; he said . 
Petraglia denied he had spoken to Mendes about the game and match referee Oscar Roberto de Godoi said there had been no approaches &quot; even by phone . 
CBF president Ricardo Teixeira said he would launch an inquiry , but pointed out that the Globo report only referred to one game . 
Vasco director Eurico Miranda called for the competition to be halted and his club , who lost the second round tie 7-6 on aggregate , to be re-admitted . 
&quot; Vasco have to be re-admitted and Atletico Paranaense must be given an exemplary punishment to re-establish the credibility of the competition . 
Atletico were subsequently eliminated by Corinthians in the quarter-finals of the competition , which is currently at its semifinal stage .
