a few aggressive investors were buying up select March calls and puts on the S &amp; P 100 index even though they go off the boards today and expire on Saturday , traders said Friday . 
&quot; We had good-size put buyers and call buyers of the expiring options , &quot; said Jack Callahan , an independent market maker in the OEX . 
&quot; There were a number of opening positions . 
they &apos;re expecting volatility in the afternoon . 
traders said the OEX March 760 calls and 770 puts were the two main ones being bought . 
traders said the expectation of afternoon volatility was not surprising since the market has had a tendency lately to make dramatic moves in the last couple of hours of trading . 
one OEX trader said volatility was high off the opening but quickly dropped . 
the Chicago Board Options Exchange &apos;s ( CBOE ) volatility index , which is priced off select OEX puts and calls , was down 1.60 points , or about 6.75 percent , at 22.16 . 
one firm said June S &amp; P 500 fair value was at 7.10 points premium to cash , with buy programs at 8.25 points premium or wider and sell programs at 5.75 points premium or narrower . 
March SPX options went off the boards Thursday and settled Friday morning on the opening of the spot index . 
volume was heavy in the OEX near-the-money calls and puts ahead of the expiration . 
the March 755 put traded more than 15,000 contracts , the March 760 put traded 19,850 , and the March 765 put traded nearly 15,000 . 
among the calls , the March 760 traded 11,200 , the 765 traded 19,580 and the 770 traded about 20,200 . 
traders said activity in the April series was relatively slack , with options selling being the most evident strategy seen . 
Lawrence McMillan , who publishes the Daily Volume Alert , said in a report that the OEX expiration bias could be on the sell side because through Thursday , there were 55,000 more in-the-money puts open than calls . 
&quot; That augurs for sell programs on the close , &quot; he said .
