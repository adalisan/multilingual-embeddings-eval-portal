Indonesian palm olein prices were mostly stable in late trading on Monday on thin buying interest due to the Moslem Ramadan fasting month , traders said . 
they said olein was quoted at 1,445-50 rupiah / kg in Jakarta , unchanged from the opening , but offers were also heard at 1,440 rupiah . 
crude palm oil was done at an equivalent of 1,225 rupiah / kg at a 500-tonne tender in the North Sumatran city of Medan , unchanged from the previous tender price . 
&quot; crude palm oil is staying high despite some weakness in palm olein , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; It might be due to supply being tight , or the buyer was short . 
&quot; Consumer demand is weak because of Ramadan , and I expect buying interest to only improve next week as it gets closer to Lebaran ( EID al-Fitr ) , &quot; the trader said . 
another trader said export prices of crude palm oil were slacking and that players would prefer to sell locally , where prices were relatively high . 
data from Belawan Port showed that the MV Jian She 51 will leave the North Sumatran port on Tuesday for Singapore with 4,610 tonnes of crude palm oil .
