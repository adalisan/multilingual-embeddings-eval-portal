Bangladesh border guards have arrested four Indians suspected of being involved in separatist movements in northeast India , police said on Wednesday . 
police arrested the suspects -- three women and a man -- at Bhandarigaon village near the India-Bangladesh border on Tuesday and seized automatic firearms and Bangladeshi and Indian currency from them . 
border officials of India and Bangladesh agreed last week not to give shelter to &quot; terrorists &quot; , including insurgents operating across their frontiers , Dhaka &apos;s Daily Star reported on Wednesday . 
&quot; Bangladesh and India have agreed not to give shelter to other country &apos;s terrorists , like cross-border insurgents , in their respective lands , &quot; the Star said , quoting officials . 
the agreement was reached at a five-day conference in the Indian capital that ended on April 12 , the newspaper said . 
at the conference , Bangladesh proposed the eviction of tribal Shanti Bahini guerrillas who came from the Chittagong Hill Tracts and are now living in camps in India &apos;s northeastern state of Tripura , the newspaper , quoting officials , said . 
the Shanti Bahini have been fighting since 1973 for autonomy in the Hill Tracts , which border India and Burma . 
India sought Dhaka &apos;s cooperation to prevent Indian &quot; terrorists &quot; from using Bangladesh as a base to conduct insurgency in northeastern states , the newspaper said . 
India had often accused Bangladesh of harbouring insurgents fighting for separate homelands in its northeastern states .
