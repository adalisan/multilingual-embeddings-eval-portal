European stocks slid on Thursday as investors , depressed by an overnight fall on Wall Street , cast nervous glances towards U.S. inflation figures due later this week . 
the dollar was little changed from late Wednesday &apos;s levels with foreign exchange traders awaiting Friday &apos;s U.S. retail sales and producer price data that will provide pointers to interest rate prospects . 
London stocks dipped by 0.3 percent after a sharp decline on Thursday ended a four-day run of record closes . 
wall Street &apos;s 36-point drop contributed to the gloom in Europe . 
the London market , Europe &apos;s biggest , was not helped by news that British retail prices showed a slightly-higher-than expected 0.5 percent rise in September , but a fresh bout of merger talk lent some support to stocks . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the market will have as bad a performance as yesterday . 
underneath this market , there &apos;s still a bit of money around that wants to get in on the dips , &quot; said one trader . 
London &apos;s bull run and the surge in other European bourses have been fuelled by signs the U.S. economy , after rapid expansion , is slowing to a level where it can sustain inflation-free growth and low interest rates . 
any change in this scenario would be regarded as bad news by markets . 
hence investors are apprehensive about the release of U.S. wholesale inflation data for September . 
the U.S. central bank has held interest rates steady , but in Britain , Bank of England governor Eddie George has warned that British rates should be raised to dampen inflationary pressures . 
other European bourses were depressed by the decline in New York stocks , which skidded to their biggest loss in a month on the inflation worries . 
wall Street also used an unfounded rumour that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had died as an excuse to take profits . 
Frankfurt suffered the sharpest fall , dropping more than 0.7 percent on the DAX index amid depression over Wall Street and weaker government bonds . 
the computerised IBIS DAX index was also down and stocks on both listings barely moved in midday trade after the Bundesbank central bank left interest rates unchanged . 
French shares fell by 0.6 percent after opening in negative ground and traders said the market needed a pause to gain its breath after recent advances . 
analysts said the index could consolidate around 2,100 before attacking the pyschologically important 2,200 level next week . 
the dollar strengthened slightly against the mark after the Bundesbank , as expected , held interest rates . 
some traders saw worries over Yeltsin &apos;s health as helping the U.S. currency . 
&quot; The dollar market was well bid . 
this underlines the sensitivity of the market because of the current situation in Russia , &quot; said Jeremy Hawkins , senior economic adviser at BankAmerica in London . 
the dollar had a brief and temporary overnight surge in Asia after unfounded rumours of Yeltsin &apos;s death circulated in the market . 
but trading was quiet and forex dealers said they expected the current levels to remain at least until Friday &apos;s U.S. data . 
&quot; There is not much that will rock the market until the end of the week , &quot; said BankAmerica &apos;s Hawkins . 
the dollar was at 1.5313 marks and 111.43 yen compared with 1.5287 marks and 111.55 yen late in Europe on Wednesday . 
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was down 9.7 points at 3999.6 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index was down 13.49 at 2,133.22 . 
gold fixed at $ 381.60 compared with $ 381.35 on Wednesday afternoon . 
silver was three cents stronger at $ 4.97 .
