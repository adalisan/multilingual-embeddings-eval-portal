Germany said on Friday it would place the Church of Scientology under nationwide observation by federal and state anti-extremist watchdogs . 
the federal Interior Ministry and Germany &apos;s 16 regional states said a working group on the matter had recommended that sufficient suspicion existed of anti-democratic intent for them to legally place Scientology under surveillance . 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said Germany would do all in its power during a year-long observation to assess whether the group , which Germany does not recognise as a religion , could be classified as anti-constitutional . 
&quot; The whole spectrum of means available to protect the constitution will be put to the service of this examination , &quot; Kanther told a news briefing that followed a two-day meeting of the interior ministers . 
Scientology , based in Los Angeles , was founded in 1954 and based on the teachings of late American science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard . 
its members take personality tests and are then offered courses and literature to help them realise what the group believes is their full potential . 
Germany argues that Scientology is purely an economic organisation which exploits the insecurities of its members to extract big profits from the self-improvement courses . 
it is also accused of suppressing its members &apos; freedoms to which they had a right under the German constitution , and of using threats to dissuade members from leaving . 
alleged breaches of the constitution raise particular concern in a country still mindful of the way Adolf Hitler brushed aside democratic controls to institute his Nazi regime . 
a spokeswoman for Scientology , which says it has some 30,000 members in Germany , told Reuters the organisation would be looking at ways it could lodge a legal challenge against the surveillance decision . 
&quot; It &apos;s a kind of thought police -- like Orwell &apos;s vision of 1984 , &quot; she said after the decision . 
about 20 Scientologists protested outside Chancellor Helmut Kohl &apos;s chancellery , where Kohl was meeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair , with placards reading : &quot; Mr. Kohl . 
stop the hate and violence against Scientology &quot; . 
&quot; We wanted to send a message to Blair to ensure that he protects religious freedom in Europe , &quot; the spokeswoman said . 
Kanther denied that surveillance , already being carried out in the two large southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg , represented persecution of the group . 
&quot; In Germany , there need be no fear of a witchhunt involving state bodies , &quot; he said . 
even if the surveillance did unearth evidence against the group , Germany could not ban it outright , he added . 
women and Family Affairs Minister Claudia Nolte backed the scrutiny , saying in a statement that &quot; our citizens must be protected against the unscrupulous profiteering of Scientology &quot; . 
the main opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) also welcomed the decision as long overdue but the smaller Green Party criticised it , calling the planned watch authoritarian . 
&quot; In contrast , an explanatory , civilised way of dealing with the Scientology organisation dominates in the rest of Europe , &quot; a group of Greens deputies said in a statement . 
&quot; Using such heavy artillery risks producing martyrs and ... making the organisation more radical , &quot; they added . 
Germany &apos;s stance on Scientology has drawn criticism from the United States and was attacked in a high-profile letter of protests signed by a number of Hollywood film stars . 
but a recent survey showed very little public support for the group in Germany , with nearly 60 percent of Germans agreeing that the group should be placed under surveillance and only 9.5 percent were against the measure outright . 
the conservative-run state of Bavaria has already excluded companies run by Scientologists from public tenders and has quizzed candidates for public sector jobs on whether they belong to the group .
