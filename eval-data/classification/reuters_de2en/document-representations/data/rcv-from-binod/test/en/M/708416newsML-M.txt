August Brent futures traded marginally lower on Friday , after sharp falls in London &apos;s IPE . 
August Brent on SIMEX was closed at $ 18.20 , down just one cent from the London close , which saw a massive fall of 71 cents to $ 18.21 . 
brokers said late trading in Asia was limited , despite earlier expectations that the shorter trading hours at NYMEX would stimulate trading on SIMEX Brent as an alternative . 
but brokers were also optimistic that levels were more likely to move up rather than down , since it resisted the trendline support of $ 18.18 .
