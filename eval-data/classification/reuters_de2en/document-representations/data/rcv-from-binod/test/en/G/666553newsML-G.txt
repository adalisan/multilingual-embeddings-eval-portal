an official of Mexico &apos;s Green party was murdered in western Guerrero state in the latest incident of political violence ahead of national mid-term elections on July 6 , officials said on Tuesday . 
Delfino Martinez Galvez , a local leader of the Mexican Green Ecology Party , was found dead on Monday in the bathtub of the party &apos;s local offices in the municipality of Ometepec , some 200 miles ( 300 km ) south of Mexico City . 
State police said he had been shot in the face but did not know a motive for the crime . 
a police statement added , however , that Martinez &quot; was known for his love of alcoholic beverages and for being a homosexual . 
in a separate development , police arrested an official of Mexico &apos;s main left-wing opposition party , the Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) , in Guerrero state on charges of belonging to a Marxist guerrilla group . 
Fidel Garcia , a PRD agricultural affairs leader , was arrested on Sunday in the municipality of Ahuacuotzingo and charged with belonging to the Marxist Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) , the military said on Tuesday . 
a wave of arrests of PRD members followed fighting between rebels and army troops in late May in which nine people died . 
seven PRD supporters in Guerrero were arrested shortly after the battles but most were later released . 
PRD leaders allege the crackdown is aimed at tarnishing the party &apos;s image ahead of the July 6 elections when Mexicans will elect most of a new Congress .
