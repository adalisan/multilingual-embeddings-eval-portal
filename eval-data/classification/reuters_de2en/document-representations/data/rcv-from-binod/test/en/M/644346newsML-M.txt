+ IPE Brent futures look set to correct higher on Friday but must clamber decisively above $ 18.52 a barrel to ensure it doesn &apos;t slip back again , technical analysts said . 
+ Oil futures are particularly vulnerable to downward pressure from NYMEX oil products which are struggling to hold above long-term trendline support , they said . 
IPE Brent may correct higher on Friday after losing ground on Thursday and extending a three week downtrend of $ 2.28 a barrel . 
the July contract is due to open 5 to 10 cents above Thursday &apos;s close of $ 18.32 a barrel but should find robust support in the recently heavily traded range of $ 18 to $ 18.20 . 
&quot; The market is definitely vulnerable to some profit taking today but the implications of another break lower are very bearish , &quot; said Charles Gray at brokers prudential Bache in London . 
&quot; As a rule of thumb you can take the mid-point of yesterday &apos;s range as a pivot for today &apos;s trading , &quot; he added . 
if Brent can scramble above the level of $ 18.52 a barrel then it could trade up to the $ 18.75 to $ 18.80 area , he said . 
but a failure to do that could leave the contract stuck in the lower half of yesterday &apos;s range $ 18.25 to $ 18.52 and exposed to possible downward pressure from weak NYMEX oil products . 
NYMEX gasoline is hovering just above a long term trendline stretching back to late 1993 , which if broken could result in further falls of about 3 cents a gallon , said Gray . 
meanwhile , gas oil is due to open little changed from Thursday &apos;s close of $ 165.75 a tonne on June . 
analysts said the contract should enjoy good support in the range $ 160 to $ 165 despite having breifly dipped into that range on Thursday afternoon .
