Europe &apos;s deep thirst for U.S. distillates is expected to keep U.S. products prices higher this week , industry sources said . 
despite government and industry concern about historically low levels of heating oil , particularly in the populous Northeast , distillates barrels continue to exit the country . 
and while a segment of the market sees that as a hole that needs to be plugged before the weather turns frigid , Gulf Coast refiners appear to be focused on profits . 
&quot; From a refiner &apos;s perspective , exporting the barrels makes perfect sense , &quot; said Tom Knight , products trader at Fina Inc . 
&quot; They can get dramatically better values by selling some export quality gas oil to Europe than keeping it here . 
on Friday , traders said another 570,000 tonnes of U.S. heating oil was being shipped to Europe in October following 400,000 tonnes of U.S. production exported to Europe at the end of September . 
&quot; If the European markets are inviting , U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are going to go for it . 
that &apos;s the free market system , &quot; explained Jack Sullivan , executive vice president of the New England Fuel Institute . 
&quot; I know it sounds crazy , but heating oil here is probably still undervalued . 
&quot; The exports are going to cut into our own stocks , &quot; a Gulf trader said , noting U.S. distillate levels were the lowest in a generation and likely to keep upward pressure on U.S. prices as colder weather sets in . 
East Coast heating oil stocks are 46 PCT below last year . 
U.S. cash market differentials for distillates have held stable and trade sluggish at both centers despite the rally . 
&quot; As long as the market is strong and backwardated there &apos;s not going to be a lot of buying except for people buying just what they need when they need it , &quot; Knight said . 
&quot; Much of the spot market activity is still hand to mouth buying . 
gasoline prices are set to firm following distillate &apos;s lead , traders said . 
but perceptions that several U.S. refineries are either cutting back output or going into maintenance turnarounds could also fuel gains . 
Unprofittable refining margins , a seasonal demand slump and the hunger for distillates has made gasoline a secondary issue , they noted . 
reports of hefty gasoline imports into the U.S. East Coast from Europe portend lower prices , but some players said the cargoes are comprised primarily of blendstocks and conventional gasoline , not reformulated gasoline ( RFG ) . 
in the Midwest , buying interest is expected to continue supporting low sulphur diesel fuel differentials as the autumn harvest season moves into full swing . 
&quot; You should see a lot of pulls from terminals , &quot; one trader said of strong agricultural demand . 
the Williams pipeline system , a key barometer of petroleum inventories in the region , had a 29-day supply of low sulphur diesel and 20-day supply of unleaded gasoline on hand . 
gasoline differentials in the Midcontinent &apos;s Chicago and Group Three markets drew strength last week from refiner buying on turnarounds and outages at key regional refineries . 
traders said Mobil Corp had trimmed runs at its 188,000 barrel per day ( bpd ) Joliet , Ill . , refinery on an unspecified outage and Texaco was set to begin a turnaround at its 94,600 bpd El Dorado , Kansas refinery over the weekend . 
farmland Ind . 
was expected by midweek to restart an idled catalytic cracker that had trimmed crude runs by half over the past two weeks at its 75,000 bpd Coffeyville , Kansas refinery . 
and Sun Oil said that it would proceed with planned maintenacnce at its 175,000 barrel a day Marcus Hook , Pa . , refinery from Oct 4 . 
sun will idle a crude distillation unit for 18 days and and a catalytic cracker for 44 days .
