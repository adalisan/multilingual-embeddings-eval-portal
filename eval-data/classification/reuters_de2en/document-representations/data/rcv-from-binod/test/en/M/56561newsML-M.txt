Spanish bonds will remain good value for a while longer as European budget season ends and high-yielders come back in vogue , but longer term Italian debt will offer better value , analysts said on Monday . 
despite weak Spanish consumer price data on Friday , signs of a firming economy make further rate cuts unlikely , creating a less positive economic backdrop for bonds , they said . 
&quot; Over the near term the Spanish market is likely to remain fairly well bid , &quot; said Adrian Owens , European economist at Julius Baer Investments in London . 
&quot; As we come out of the budget season EMU ( European Monetary Union ) concerns will subside and we will see a move back to the convergence trend whereby the high-yielders will continue to do well , &quot; Owens said . 
the bono / Bund 10-year yield spread was at 222 basis points at 1314 GMT , close to the narrowest level for the year at 216 basis points , seen in July . 
the gap has pulled in from 371 basis points at the beginning of January . 
Owens said even at the current level he would expect 10-year bonds to thrive . 
&quot; The big issue is the drive to convergence and that will continue to support Spanish bonds over the next few weeks , &quot; he said . 
yields of bonds in peripheral countries have contracted sharply against the European core this year as governments try to slash spending and deficits in an effort to meet the strict fiscal requirements of EMU . 
Phyllis Reed , European bond strategist at BZW in London , said the yield spread had hit BZW &apos;s target level of 224 basis points and was unsure how much more the gap could narrow . 
&quot; To go further we would have to feel more comfortable about inflation and the public sector finance situation for next year , &quot; she said . 
&quot; But on balance it &apos;s a pretty neutral situation for Spain right now . 
there is no massive upward pressure on the ( bono / Bund ) spread , at least over next few days , &quot; Reed said . 
full details of the Spanish budget are not likely to be relased until September 27 , but a broad outline of the proposals is expected to be presented to the cabinet later this week . 
analysts said with economic growth beginning to show signs of coming on stream the budget was not likely to cause any major concerns for the market . 
Owens said in many ways the domestic backdrop was not as supportive for bonds as it had been a few months ago , whereas in Italy it still was . 
&quot; There is more scope for Italian inflation to fall than there is for further inflation falls in Spain , &quot; he said . 
Reed also said investors would be better off looking at Italy which lagged behind in the rate cutting cycle . 
with the potential for further cuts in Italian interest rates , the market be supported at the short end , she said , whereas Spanish interest rates were nearing the point when they would just follow Germany . 
&quot; They &apos;ve done probably almost as much independent easing as they can do , whereas Italy has this additional support coming through , &quot; she said . 
&quot; That in itself is quite a strong argument to suggest switching as we hit these ( spread ) lows in Spain . 
&quot; But some analysts said the future for Spanish bonds would remain bright . 
Luca Jellinek , bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets in London said people were still generally optimistic about bonos . 
&quot; Everything just seems to be working well at the same time . 
the technicals look good , the dollar is strong and there was a good inflation number , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There doesn &apos;t seem to be any downside for people to latch onto , the market is doing so well no one wants to be short .
