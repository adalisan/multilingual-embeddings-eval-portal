Hong Kong stocks dropped sharply around midday on Tuesday as heavy profit-taking emerged after a brief rebound on the Hang Seng Index brought the blue chip barometer above the 15,000 mark , brokers said . 
the index fell 157 points , or 1.05 percent to 14,832 on turnover of HK $ 12.17 billion . 
&quot; The market looks volatile but there is no special news , &quot; said Kinson Au , research manager at Asia Financial Securities . 
the Hang Seng rebounded at mid-morning to an all-time intraday record of 15,020.96 after an 148 points opening loss . 
it eased further to a low of 14,770.58 , down 220.32 points , shortly before the midsession close . 
&quot; At this level the market is very overbought so I would say the upside from this level will be quite limited , &quot; said Percy Au-Young , director of research at DBS Securities .
