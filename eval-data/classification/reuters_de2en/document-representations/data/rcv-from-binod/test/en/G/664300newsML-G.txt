outspoken Irish pop star Sinead O &apos;Connor withdrew from a peace concert in Jerusalem on Monday after death threats scuttled her foray into the turbulent politics of the city holy to Moslems , Christians and Jews . 
Saturday &apos;s concert by O &apos;Connor -- now a Buddhist -- was to cap off a four-day festival sponsored by Israeli and Palestinian women entitled &apos; Sharing Jerusalem : two Capitals for Two States &apos; . 
&quot; Sinead received death threats which said that if she comes under the headline &apos; two capitals for two states &apos; they will shoot her , &quot; festival organiser Dafna Golan told Israel radio . 
&quot; She said she was afraid and decided not to come . 
o &apos;Connor , who once publicly ripped up a picture of the Pope , is no stranger to Middle East controversy . 
in Jerusalem in 1995 , she attacked two photographers near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , traditional site of Jesus &apos;s crucifixion . 
the festival has enraged right-wing Jews , who say it undermines what they is Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem , including its Arab Eastern half captured by the Jewish state in 1967 . 
Israel &apos;s occupation of the city &apos;s eastern sector is not recognised by the international community . 
organisers would not say who was behind the threats . 
one Jewish ultra-nationalist told Israel Radio the outlawed anti-Arab Kach group had not issued the threats but nonetheless claimed success in scuttling the concert . 
&quot; A singer who preaches and calls for the division of Jerusalem and spreads Gentile culture has no place is Israel . 
we certainly view the pressure we exerted so she wouldn &apos;t come to Israel as successful , &quot; Itamar Ben-Gvir told the radio . 
Jerusalem &apos;s right-wing mayor Ehud Olmert , pleased the festival he dubbed a &quot; provocation &quot; and &quot; anti-Israel propaganda &quot; had been dealt a setback , said poor ticket sales were behind the concert &apos;s cancellation . 
&quot; It appears the people of Israel are smarter and more responsible . 
they simply didn &apos;t buy tickets , &quot; Olmert said . 
organisers said tickets had been selling well .
