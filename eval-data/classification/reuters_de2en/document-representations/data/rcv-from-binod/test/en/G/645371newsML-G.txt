France on Saturday welcomed a mediation offer by Gabonese President Omar Bongo in a bid to end a flareup in fighting in Congo Brazzaville , but warned French citizens in the Congo capital to stay at home . 
&quot; France supports the mediation offer of President Bongo , whom we congratulate , &quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said . 
&quot; This appeal could enable the normal democratic electoral process to go forward . 
Paris on Friday urged all sides in the fighting to renounce violence so a presidential election scheduled for July 27 could go ahead . 
relative calm reigned in Brazzaville on Saturday after two days of fighting between supporters of former president Denis Sassou Nguesso and the army , witnesses said .
