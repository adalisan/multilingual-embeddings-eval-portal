one of the Marxist rebels holding 72 hostages in the Japanese embassy residence in Lima apparently left the building on Tuesday for face-to-face talks with the Peruvian government aimed at a peaceful solution to the eight-week-old siege . 
a Red Cross car entered the residence , pulled alongside the building out of sight of witnesses , and left a few minutes later before entering the nearby house selected for talks via a garage . 
the car was believed to be holding Rolly Rojas , the second-in-command of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) , selected to represent the group in preliminary talks . 
earlier , government negotiator Domingo Palermo and three members of a guarantors commission overseeing the talks arrived at the site along with Terusuke Tarada , the Japanese government &apos;s observer . 
the talks will be the first direct negotiations since Palermo met MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini inside the residence Dec . 28 . 
attempts to relaunch the talks in January stalled on the government &apos;s refusal to consider the MRTA &apos;s main demand for the release of some 400 jailed comrades . 
government officials and mediators have said they will not reveal details of the talks .
