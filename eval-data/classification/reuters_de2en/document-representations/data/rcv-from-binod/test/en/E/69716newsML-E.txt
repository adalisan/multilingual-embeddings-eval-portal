Japan should avoid raising interest rates and tightening budget policy for now because it remains unclear whether its economic recovery is strongly under way , a senior IMF official said on Monday . 
&quot; We wouldn &apos;t at this stage recommend a change in the accomodative monetary policy , &quot; the International Monetary Fund official , who declined to be named , told reporters . 
&quot; And we wouldn &apos;t at this stage recommend to start withdrawing fiscal stimulus , &quot; he added . 
in a briefing ahead of the IMF / World Bank annual meeting here later this week , the official pronounced the IMF &quot; reasonably satisfied &quot; with Japan &apos;s economic performance . 
the Japanese economy is recovering at a moderate underlying pace , although the upswing has been &quot; bumpy , &quot; he said . 
it does seem broadly on course for achieving the 3-1 / 2 percent growth the IMF envisages for this year . 
&quot; We are not totally sure that ... the recovery is strongly on its way &quot; he said , adding , &quot; The jury is still out to decide if you need more or less fiscal stimulus . 
starting in 1997 , Japan will have to begin thinking about tackling its big budget deficit . 
&quot; Restrictive fiscal policies will have to be implemented ( in the medium term ) , &quot; he said .
