Asian diesel may be hovering at its highest value in five-years , propped up by strong western fundamentals , but there is little regional demand supporting the price , industry sources said on Tuesday . 
traders said prices in Singapore are threatening to break a fresh five-year high , but even at this high level diesel in Singapore is a record $ 20 per tonne below the October gas oil futures contract traded on the International Petroleum Exchange . 
&quot; This is a sign that prices in Singapore are very weak . 
at this time last year prices in Singapore were $ 13- $ 14 per tonne more than the west , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; The market is dragged up by western futures . 
the supply and demand balance does not warrant such strong prices , &quot; one refiner said . 
on Monday , a trader was willing to pay $ 28.50 per barrel free-on-board Singapore for 150,000 barrels--well above the five-year high trade of $ 27.90 seen in early September when the U.S. fired missiles on Iraqi military targets . 
low gas oil stocks in the U.S. and Europe ahead of the peak winter demand period are supporting the oil complex globally . 
for now Asian just-in-time demand and supply is reasonably balanced as no arbitrage barrels are finding their way into the region , traders said . 
but some traders said if prices fell just $ 1- $ 2 per barrel , Asian buyers would return in full force to replenish declining stocks . 
&quot; No one &apos;s building any stocks , &quot; a trader said , lamenting current prices . 
traders point to India as one of the most bearish factors in the market . 
India cancelled its November import tender and has bought unusually small amounts of diesel in its last three monthly tenders , largely because of congestion problems at its ports . 
China has held back in recent days , but was forced to buy one spot cargo last week because of low stocks , at $ 218 per tonne cost-and-freight basis . 
China would return more aggressively if prices fell to around $ 27.00 per barrel ( $ 201 per tonne ) fob Singapore , a trader said . 
traders said the market would easily fall to $ 27.00 if the support from the west was lost , as was the case in mid September when gas oil swaps traded down to $ 26.80 following a sharp drop in crude and heating oil prices . 
but alternatively , there was always the potential for gas oil to trade out of Singapore into East Africa , given the east-west arbitrage , if the economics of such deals worked , traders said . 
&quot; If the arbitrage is wide enough then product from Singapore would be exported to East Africa , &quot; a trader said . 
for now ample arbitrage exports of Middle East cargoes to Africa and the Mediterranean have been seen , traders said . 
October gas oil swaps traded late on Monday to a high of $ 28.50 , brokers said . 
they are currently quoted at $ 28.15- $ 28.25 in Singapore .
