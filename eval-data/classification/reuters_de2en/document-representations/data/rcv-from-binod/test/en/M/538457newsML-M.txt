front month August dominated volume , with 800 of 1,080 lots .

the only exception to the rise was October 1997 , which traded just 30 lots . 
it last traded 20 cents down at $ 304.60 
&quot; The August &apos;s steady but it &apos;s just a function of New York being reasonably strong , &quot; one trader said . 
the rise was just a progression , he said . 
given the thin volume , the day had been &quot; pretty much a waste of time , &quot; the trader said . 
earlier , technical analysts said they expected the upward momentum to continue for the time being as the position was well supported , not yet overbought and still holding above a three month trendline .
