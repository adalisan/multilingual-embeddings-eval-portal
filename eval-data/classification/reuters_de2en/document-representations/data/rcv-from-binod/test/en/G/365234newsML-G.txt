Ecuador &apos;s defense minister resigned on Saturday amid reports that the military had withdrawn all support from the government of embattled President Abdala Bucaram . 
&quot; General Victor Bayas has resigned the post of defense minister , &quot; the ministry said in a terse statement . 
the statement gave no reason for Bayas &apos; sudden decision to join the three other cabinet officials , including Energy Minister Alfredo Adum , who have abandoned Bucaram &apos;s government in the last 48 hours . 
but it said Bayas , who declared a nationwide state of emergency on Friday to quell anti-Bucaram protests , had issued a call for &quot; peace and order &quot; amid the country &apos;s political crisis . 
the people of Ecuador should work for a better future for &quot; the fatherland and society without excesses that could have lamentable consequences , &quot; the statement said . 
armed forces chief Gen. Paco Moncayo was named to replace Bayas as acting defense minister .
