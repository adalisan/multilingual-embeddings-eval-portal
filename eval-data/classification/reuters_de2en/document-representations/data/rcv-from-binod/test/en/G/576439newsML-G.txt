unpopular French Prime Minister Alain Juppe , sounding eager to keep his job should his centre-right government hang onto power in a snap parliamentary election , said on Monday he was prepared to change his ways . 
&quot; To change your ways surely means to renew your team but it also means modernising your methods and your behaviour , &quot; Juppe told a campaign rally in Clermont-Ferrand , central France . 
&quot; It means to replace bureaucracy and intervention with consultation and participation . 
Juppe had been stung by remarks by former president Valery Giscard d &apos;Estaing , a member of the governing coalition , who said last week that France should shift to bolder and simpler policies and that current President Jacques Chirac should form a new team after the May 25-June 1 election . 
the conservative Juppe , seen by many voters as a humourless technocrat for his driving manner and austere policies , has also come under fire from other members of the majority for lacklustre leadership of the government campaign . 
but the centre-right has been buoyed by a series of polls showing it taking a commanding lead over the leftist opposition less than two weeks before the first round of voting . 
the latest Harris poll for LCI television found the centre-right winning 40 percent of the first-round vote , two percentage points more than a similar poll a week earlier . 
the combined left would win 37 percent , a dip of one percentage point from the previous week , with the far-right National Front unchanged at 15 percent , it found . 
the poll said 57 percent believed the centre-right would win the election while 25 percent thought the left would prevail . 
Socialist leader Lionel Jospin , trying to divert attention from the polls and left-wing in-fighting , insisted the race was wide open . 
he said a centre-right win would be a &quot; reward for lies &quot; after what he called broken government promises . 
&quot; We have two weeks to tell the French people that they ( the centre-right majority ) have tricked you , they have failed . 
and as you have done in the past you must punish them , defeat them and elect a different majority , &quot; Jospin told a rally in Metz , eastern France . 
left-wing disarray is delighting Juppe &apos;s government , who portrays the Socialists as hostages to Communist dinosaurs unfit to solve problems starting with France &apos;s record unemployment of 12.8 percent . 
Communist party boss Robert Hue insisted his small party , which wants big wage hikes for the low-paid and a referendum on a single European currency from 1999 , should have a say in policy if the left wins the May 25-June 1 election . 
&quot; There will be no left-wing majority without all components of the left -- including the Communist party , &quot; Hue wrote in the party &apos;s daily newspaper L &apos;Humanite , which has a hammer-and-sickle emblem on its front page . 
&quot; And for this new majority to be formed , all components will have to decide the new policy together . 
Jospin retorted that the party with the most votes should fix policy , especially on disputed issues such as Europe , and denied seeking hegemony over the left . 
the Socialists favour the common currency on conditions that stop short of a referendum . 
&quot; It &apos;s not the hegemony of one political group or another that decides , it &apos;s democracy , &quot; he said in Reims , northeastern France . 
&quot; It seems logical to me that the guidelines that win the most votes on the first round should be applied , &quot; he said . 
though they disagree on many issues , the Socialists and Communists both accuse the government of planning a new bout of austerity to help France qualify for a single European currrency if the centre-right wins the election .
