the Council of the League : 
after the council had studied the latest developments , the imminent dangers and the obstacles which Israel has put forward to destroy the current peace process , 
in view of the Arab states &apos; commitment to achieve just and comprehensive peace in the region and their desire to save the peace process , 
the Council of the League recommends as follows : 
stopping all normalisation steps which have been taken with Israel in the framework of the current peace process , and halting all dealings with it , including closing offices and missions , until Israel obeys the frame of reference of the Madrid conference , the principle of land for peace , and implementation of the agreements , undertakings and commitments which the parties concerned have reached on all tracks during peace talks . 
suspending Arab participation in the multilateral talks and continuing to maintain the primary Arab boycott and reactivating it against Israel until a just and comprehensive peace is achieved in the region .
