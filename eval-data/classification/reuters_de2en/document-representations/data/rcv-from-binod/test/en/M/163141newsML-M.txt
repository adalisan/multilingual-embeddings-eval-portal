a wave of speculative selling sent London cocoa futures to new seven-month lows on Monday as nearby support crumbled , triggering light sell stops . 
&quot; There was a little pressure at the end of the session , &quot; said one trader . 
low prices attracted light industry buying and the session also saw some arbitrage selling against New York . 
traders said selling pressure exacerbated at the close after a relatively milder morning which was helped by sterling &apos;s easier tone in currency markets . 
but cocoa &apos;s latest plunge proved how feeble was the support at 945 stg as the benchmark March slipped to a new contract low of 935 stg with little hesitancy . 
it closed 13 stg down on the day at 936 . 
&quot; 945 is non-existent , &quot; said one trader . 
but the contract traded mostly at the 940 level throughout the rest of the session , with stops coming into effect at around 945 . 
sterling &apos;s renewed strength against the dollar in the afternoon also added to pressure , keeping industry buying at a minimum . 
the market &apos;s structure remained wide with Dec / March trading at 32 and 34 stg and March / May at 20 . 
on the physical side , some 90,000 tonnes of cocoa awaiting shipment in Abidjan is weighing on market sentiment with traders expecting the bulk of November exports and the delayed October cargo in the next few weeks . 
&quot; What is arriving doesn &apos;t seem to be wanted by the industry , &quot; said one . 
technically , Monday &apos;s close has cleared the way for a sharper move toward the low of 883 stg with mild support pegged at 915 and 900 , analysts said .
