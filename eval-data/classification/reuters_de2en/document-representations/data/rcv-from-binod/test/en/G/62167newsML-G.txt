a senior Kuwaiti diplomat will visit Russia on Thursday to discuss the latest U.S. flare-up with former occupier Iraq , a Kuwaiti official said . 
foreign Ministry Undersecretary Suleiman al-Shaheen will deliver a message from Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabh to Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , the official said . 
Primakov and other senior Russian officials denounced as unacceptable U.S. air strikes on Iraq on September 3 and 4 aimed at punishing Baghdad for attacks on northern Iraqi Kurds . 
Russia has generally taken a softer line on Iraq than the United States since the end of the 1991 Gulf War , and has been pushing Washington and its Western European allies to lift crippling post-war sanctions against Baghdad . 
Moscow fears the latest crisis could hurt its chances of recouping Baghdad &apos;s big debt to the former Soviet Union because of delays in implementing a United Nations agreement to let sanction-squeezed Iraq sell some oil . 
Kuwaitis were dismayed by a statement on Sunday by Vladimir Titorenko , deputy head of the Russian embassy in Baghdad , that Moscow did not recognise Western-imposed no-fly zones and Iraq had the right to shoot down aircraft patrolling them . 
the Russian Foreign Ministry later said these statements did not correspond to its position . 
Kuwaiti analysts said they expected Shaheen would ask Russian officials to clarify their position .
