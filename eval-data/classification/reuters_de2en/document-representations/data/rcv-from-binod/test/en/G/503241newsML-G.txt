the draft bill on the companies act submitted to the Finance Minister had recommended reduction in the number of sections to less than 500 and the number of schedules to just three . 
the working group report had made a three-fold classification of private companies . 
it had also suggested lesser government regulations , greater flexibility in the operations of public companies , but with stricter compliance norms . 
the Foreign Investment Promotion Board approved 10 power projects in the private sector totalling a capacity of 2,240 megawatts ( MW ) . 
the proposals , with investment of over 70 billion rupees , were cleared at the meeting chaired by the industry secretary . 
the new project proposals included Global Power &apos;s 154 MW thermal power project , a 100 MW thermal power project of Independent Power Service Corporation of the United States and a 25 MW diesel power plant by St Power System lnc with $ 7 million equity . 
the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) announced new valuation norms for banks &apos; investment portfolios which would allow them to write back the excess provisions made in 1995 / 96 ( April-March ) and beef up their tier II capital . 
it also announced 13.56 percent as the yield to maturity for government securities of maturity 10 years and above . 
this would be the first public offer under the new code .

India sought 29 new orbital slots for its Insat satellites over the next 10 years to supplement its meagre space real estate of three slots . 
this is intended to pre-empt leading satellite providers like Intelsat from cornering available slots in the geostationary orbit over Asia-Pacific . 
the application was made early this year by the department of telecommunication , the Indian agency for negotiating satellite frequencies . 
India &apos;s failure to get these slots would be a big blow for the Indian Space Research Organisation which would not be able to position satellites in orbit despite having them . 
stock markets swung with the political developments in New Delhi . 
the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange sensitive index had opened strong at 3,640 , but fell in the afternoon session to close at 3598.37 , a fall of 52.51 points over the previous close of 3650.88 . 
the National Stock Exchange index dosed at 1,008.35 , losing 21.95 points over the previous close of 1,030.30 . 
the market witnessed speculative trading , characterised by sharp intra-day fluctuations , with a swing of 86 points for the Sensetive index . 
domestic and foreign institutional investors stayed largely away from the market . 
cellular operators ruled out a revenue-sharing arrangement with the Department of Telecommunications ( dot ) to resolve the contentious issue of fixed-to-cellular tariffs . 
instead , their association favoured a numbering plan-based solution . 
the operators were insisting on multiple points of interconnect with the dot network . 
they were willing to set up small exchanges , dubbed virtual mobile switching centres , in different parts of a circle to interconnect to the dot network . 
multiple points of interconnect in tandem with a district-wise numbering plan would help tide over the problem of charging high tariffs for calls even made within the same city . 
the Observer 
the government said it would consider proposals for foreign investment in the information and broadcasting sectors after a new policy was announced . 
it had been decided that application for foreign investment in respect of any aspect of broadcasting would be entertained by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board ( FIPB ) only after the new policy was announced by the government . 
the official statement did not specify when the policy would be ready .
