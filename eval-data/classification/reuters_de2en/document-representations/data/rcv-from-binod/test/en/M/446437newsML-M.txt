base metals struggled to sustain an upwards push on Monday , as confusing news on Chinese copper imports kept the market on edge . 
zinc and lead were the most gutsy , both notching up fresh cyclical peaks on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) , while copper and aluminium trailed in their wake . 
zinc ploughed through a 4-1 / 2 year high of $ 1,300 a tonne in the wake of Friday &apos;s stock fall , but closed just below at $ 1,296 . 
lead gripped more tightly to its $ 700 foothold , after it surged to an eight week high of $ 710 , helped by option-related buying in the Far East . 
LME copper prices bounced around after rumours that Chinese authorities had ordered traders to suspend imports and not sell their copper were dismissed by Chinese officials . 
three month copper closed $ 13 down at $ 2,343 a tonne , after it earlier crawled above $ 2,364 . 
Shanghai trading sources said last week an official directive had instructed copper dealers to to suspend imports in support of state mines and hold positions in order to prevent price falls in the red metal . 
but an official of the China National Nonferrous metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) , which is responsible for China &apos;s copper trade , said they were now urging traders to sell , after last week recommending they hold positions to wait for further price rises . 
&quot; We think firms engaged in hedging should enter the market now and sell , &quot; said the CNIEC official , adding that with the strong short-term outlook in domestic copper , it was a good time to sell . 
the official said firms were told to hold hedging positions after meeting last Tuesday to discuss the domestic and international copper market . 
but he added : &quot; It is not up to us to decide whether to import , that will be decided by the market . 
&quot; The markets are a bit nervous about this , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; You never know with the Chinese , sometimes they say the opposite of what they mean . 
analysts said while China continued to send nervous ripples through the market , copper prices would stay bracketed inside recent ranges . 
but others were more sceptical , saying they were taking reports from China with &quot; a pinch of salt &quot; . 
they said it was more likely to be messy technicals rattling the copper market . 
however , most Western traders are concerned that if Chinese buying , expected to take off after the Chinese New Year in February , does not soon start in earnest , copper could tumble on the London Metal Exchange . 
copper did not reap any gains from news that Zairean rebels were headed for the mining centre of Lumbumbashi after they captured Kisangani at the weekend . 
broker GNI said in a commentary that , at worst , only 30,000 tonnes of copper ( annually ) could be affected . 
in soft commodities , coffee rebounded slightly from a bout of selling which pulled it down on Friday , but May robusta futures struggled to hold on to the $ 1,700 level . 
the contract closed barely changed at $ 1,690 a tonne , after a session low of $ 1,680 . 
analysts said last week the market , which has rallied 50 percent this year , could be due for a pause . 
cocoa , however , took a last-minute upward swing on trade-buying and arbitrage , after edging lower as traders consolidated last week &apos;s sharp gains . 
may cocoa closed up nine stg at 1,029 stg . 
crude oil futures retraced a thin lunchtime rally , and May Brent , the new front month contract was trading down $ 13 at 19.61 a barrel at 1740 GMT . 
traders said the market was very lethargic .
