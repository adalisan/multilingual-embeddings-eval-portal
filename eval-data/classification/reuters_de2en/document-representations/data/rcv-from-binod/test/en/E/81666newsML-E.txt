the economy grew a little less vigorously in the spring than previously thought , the government said Friday , but still ran at its strongest pace in two years before starting to lose a step in the summer . 
the nation &apos;s gross domestic product , or GDP , expanded at a revised 4.7 percent annual rate instead of a 4.8 percent rate in the second quarter , the Commerce Department said in its final revision of economic activity for the period . 
it was the sturdiest growth since the second quarter of 1994 , when GDP surged at a 4.9 percent rate , and was more than double the first quarter &apos;s 2 percent rate of growth . 
but analysts said the expansion was slowing in the third quarter , with consumer spending waning and home-building losing some steam . 
&quot; The revisions still show an economy that was abnormally strong in the second quarter but that is poised to decelerate quite a bit in the third and fourth quarters , &quot; said economist Sung won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis . 
he predicted the third-quarter growth rate will ease to about 2.5 percent , adding that might still be &quot; a tad too fast &quot; for Federal Reserve policy-makers , who likely prefer a safely non-inflationary growth rate of around 2 percent . 
the central bank policy-makers passed up an opportunity this week to raise short-term interest rates to restrain growth , apparently waiting to see whether the economy will slow enough on its own to keep wage and price inflation in check . 
the main reason for the slim revision down in the second-quarter GDP figure was that federal government spending was not quite as strong as estimated earlier . 
the Commerce Department said federal spending climbed at a $ 10.5 billion annual rate instead of $ 11.9 billion estimated a month ago . 
GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced by workers and capital within a country &apos;s borders . 
most of the final second-quarter revisions were small and did not significantly change the earlier estimate , the department said . 
the first look at third-quarter GDP is a month away , not long before Fed policy-makers meet next on Nov . 13 . 
unless it confirms that the second-quarter &apos;s economic momentum has faded as expected , the central bank could be under renewed pressure to raise rates in a bid to ward off inflation . 
&quot; If by that time there are only a few signs of slowing down , ( Fed Chairman Alan ) Greenspan may have no choince but to tap on the economic brakes , &quot; said economist Oscar Gonzalez of Boston-based John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co . 
but there already are signs of slowing as consumer spending softens at home and lackluster overseas economies limit exports of U.S.-made goods . 
sales at retail stores barely edged up in July and August . 
the latest available figures show the U.S. trade balance deteriorated sharply in July as exports weakened . 
a separate survey of consumer sentiment , compiled by the University of Michigan and issued only to paying subscribers , showed some wariness in September despite strong job and income growth . 
the index of consumer sentiment fell to 94.7 from 95.3 in August , signalling a possible slowdown in consumer spending that fuels two-thirds of the economy . 
businesses were already cautious about adding to stocks of unsold goods , and any sign of consumer retrenchment may reinforce worries about inventories before the important Christmas selling season . 
during the second quarter businesses increased their inventories by a revised $ 7.1 billion instead of $ 7.2 billion estimated a month ago . 
that followed a $ 3 billion decrease in stocks of unsold goods during the first quarter and bolstered growth by keeping production up . 
consumer spending grew 3.4 percent at a $ 38.5 billion annual rate in the second quarter , the same as estimated a month ago , after growing by 3.5 percent in the first quarter . 
there was no sign of accelerating inflation . 
two inflation measures in the GDP report were left unrevised as the implicit price deflator advanced at a 1.8 percent annual rate , compared with 2.2 percent in the first quarter . 
a separate fixed-weights measure of price changes rose 2.2 percent compared with 2.3 percent in the first quarter . 
despite the strong second-quarter expansion , corporate profits weakened , falling 0.2 percent from the first quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 408.1 billion . 
department officials said it was the first time in a year that quarterly profits dipped , since they fell 2 percent in the second quarter of 1995 .
