the House of Representatives Thursday narrowly backed an effort by Republicans to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts , which conservatives see as a moneywaster that funds immoral art projects . 
voting 217 to 216 , the House cleared the way for a vote on Republicans &apos; plan to replace the NEA , which distributes direct grants for arts projects , with a system of block grants to school districts and arts councils . 
Democrats failed to force a vote on their plan to reinstate $ 100 million , cut by Republicans , to operate the NEA next year . 
the House will vote instead on the Republicans &apos; plan to replace the NEA with $ 80 million of block grants distributed to school districts and state arts councils . 
&quot; The rule we are considering today will kill for all time the National Endowment for the Arts . 
with this rule they are killing federal support for the arts , &quot; Rep. Joe Moakley , a Massachusetts Democrat , said . 
House Republican Leader Richard Armey of Texas called the NEA &quot; the single most deplorable black eye on the arts , &quot; and said the block grant system would result in fairer distribution of arts support funds . 
the White House has threatened to veto the bill if it replaced the NEA with block grants .
