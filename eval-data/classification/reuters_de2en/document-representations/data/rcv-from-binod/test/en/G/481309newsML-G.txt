Brazilian government officials on Tuesday promised thorough investigations into the alleged killing of a man by Sao Paulo police officers in a case that has triggered widespread public revolt . 
Brazilian television showed Sao Paulo police officers beating drivers at a roadblock and firing at a car , allegedly killing a passenger . 
a government spokesman said President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was shocked by the video footage . 
&quot; The president is outraged . 
he was shocked by the images and concerned about the impact of the news , &quot; presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral told reporters . 
at an earlier news conference , Sao Paulo state governor Mario Covas publicly apologised for the blatant abuse by the state &apos;s military police force . 
Covas said nine officers arrested in connection with the case would be tried by a civilian court under a new law recently passed by Congress which established the transfer from military justice to civil justice of crimes against life . 
in the footage aired on Monday by Globo television , the leader of a police operation is shown hitting drivers and passengers of stopped cars with his baton and strolling around with a gun in his hand , in the early hours of March 3 . 
it also showed footage from March 7 , of officers at a roadblock in the same place allegedly extorting money from innocent people driving by . 
after beating up the occupants of one car , a police officer was filmed firing twice into the back of the vehicle after it drove away . 
Globo said a passenger was hit and died later in the hospital . 
Governor Covas said a preliminary police investigation identified the dead man as Mario Jose Josino , a 31-year-old car mechanic . 
Covas said six police officers were arrested for Josino &apos;s murder on March 7 . 
the Globo report , which has been shown repeatedly on main channels , has sparked a wave of public repudiation . 
Call-in radio programmes received hundreds of calls from angry citizens , and human rights activists said police violence against innocent civilians was rampant in Brazil . 
&quot; This kind of stuff happens all the time . 
however , what is different in this case is that it is down on film , &quot; said James Cavallaro of Human Rights / Americas Watch . 
Congressional deputies called for a parliamentary committee to investigate police violence , and said they would speed up a bill under which all crimes committed by police officers would be tried by civil law . 
Sao Paulo &apos;s military police has a documented history of abuses against civilians . 
the worst incident was the 1992 killing of 111 inmates at Sao Paulo &apos;s Carandiru prison after an elite force was called in to quash a prisoners &apos; mutiny .
