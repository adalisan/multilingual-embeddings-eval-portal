Tokyo gold futures ended higher in quiet trade on Wednesday amid Japan &apos;s summer holidays , helped by a strong recovery in bullion prices , traders said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen some short covering , though I don &apos;t think we can say the gold &apos;s downtrend is over , &quot; said a trader at one of Japan &apos;s major trading houses . 
spot gold was quoted at $ 328.60 / 9.00 per ounce at 0710 GMT after hitting a low around $ 324.80 in New York overnight . 
most platinum group metals ( PGMs ) continued their slide prompted by Monday &apos;s news that a strike at South Africa &apos;s Impala platinum Holdings Ltd had ended . 
gold futures were unchanged to up five yen per gram higher , helped by bullion &apos;s advance . 
Most-active benchmark June was up three yen at 1,215 yen . 
another trader said : &quot; We might see some funds flowing into gold as the Dow ( Jones Industrial average ) started to fall , though upside remains very heavy . 
palladium futures shed between one to six yen per gram , with benchmark June closing down one yen at 698 yen . 
platinum futures were mixed , with the nearby August losing 23 yen while benchmark June added six yen to end at 1,512 . 
one trader said : &quot; In white metals , you still cannot push down the prices a lot . 
there &apos;re still quite a lot of short positions left . 
but another trader said platinum futures could decline as the metal &apos;s prices have been pulled up by tightness in the physical palladium market .
