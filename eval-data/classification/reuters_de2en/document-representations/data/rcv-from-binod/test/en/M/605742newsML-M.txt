implied volatilities for forex options were lower across the board in U.S. trading , with the inverted volatility curve flattening rapidly as the spot-sensitive front end recoiled , dealers said . 
with the spot dollar roughly four yen above Tuesday &apos;s 111.98 yen low , the epicenter of recent volatile activity , and with a long weekend coming up in the United States and Britain , traders were taking some air out of the short dates , which had become very pricey in recent sessions . 
&quot; It &apos;s been more of a reactionary trading , &quot; said a European bank trader in Chicago . 
&quot; People had to buy something because ... spot was coming down and now they have to sell it because spot &apos;s going back up , &quot; he said . 
implied volatilities for one-month and one-year dollar / yen options dropped to 12.5 / 12.7 and 10.5 / 10.7 percent by U.S. midsession from 13.8 / 14.1 and 11.0 / 11.2 late on Wednesday . 
one-week dollar / yen was assessed at 14.5 / 15.5 percent against 16.0 / 17.0 on Wednesday and around 20.0 on Tuesday . 
the dollar has been drifting to and fro between 115.50 and 116.20 yen through most of European and U.S. trading . 
&quot; People are just disappointed that we &apos;re hanging around here , &quot; a U.S. investment bank trader in New York said . 
still , traders said front-end volatilities could come right back up if spot starts testing lows again , especially once the time-decay concern is out of the way early next week . 
Monday is a public holiday in the U.S. and Britain . 
&quot; I &apos;m actually surprised how yen vols came in as much as they did , &quot; said a trader for a hedge fund in New York . 
he noted that risk reversals , the put / call pricing differential , had narrowed significantly but that they were still definitely bid for yen calls . 
one-month 25-delta dollar / yen risk reversal was pegged at 0.9 / 1.2 point skewed for yen calls , off a quarter point . 
dollar / mark volatilities were also lower with a flatter curve , but to a much lesser extent . 
one-month and one-year dollar / mark stood at 9.3 / 9.6 and 9.1 / 9.3 percent respectively against Wednesday &apos;s 9.6 / 9.9 and 9.15 / 9.25 . 
&quot; Dollar / mark moved basically because dollar / yen and mark / yen dragged it around , &quot; the Chicago trader said . 
&quot; Vols were up a little but there really wasn &apos;t much going on . 
for most of the day , spot has been in the 1.69-mark area , the center of recent ranges . 
it has traded between 1.6750 and 1.7100 marks for nearly two weeks apart from a few brief excursions outside that range . 
&quot; I would say people who were short ( options ) there are still short , &quot; the Chicago trader added . 
&quot; Maybe they lost a little money in the last few days but they &apos;re still holding on to their short positions because they &apos;re still right . 
one-month 25-delta risk reversal for dollar / mark was virtually unchanged at relatively narrow levels , 0.2 / 0.5 point bid for mark calls .
