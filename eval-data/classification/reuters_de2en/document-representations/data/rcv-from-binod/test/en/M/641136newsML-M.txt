North Korea has cancelled a zinc-for-food swap that would have provided the food-short nation with 20,000 metric tonnes of wheat , grains giant Cargill Inc said on Thursday . 
&quot; We were informed by the government of North Korea ... they had chosen not to perform , &quot; Cargill spokeswoman Lori Johnson said in a telephone interview . 
&quot; Regrettably , under those circumstances , we will not deliver the wheat . 
no reason was given for the cancellation . 
traders in Tokyo said zinc production in communist-run North Korea was plunging because of floods and lack of electricity to refine the ore . 
they estimated output at 1,500 tonnes per month . 
the traders forecast North Korean 1997 zinc exports to Japan would stay low at around 7,000 tonnes after falling from more than 10,000 tonnes in 1995 . 
in that year North Korea was the second-largest zinc exporter to Japan after China . 
Cargill remained interested in commercial sales to North Korea , Johnson said , but at this point , no further discussions were scheduled nor did any appear likely in the near future . 
last winter , Cargill was given permission by the Clinton administration to pursue grain sales with Pyongyang -- a rarely granted opportunity that came during a moment of warmer relations between the nations . 
Johnson said Pyongyang notified Cargill , a private company , last week of its decision to cancel the barter . 
food trade with North Korea has been enmeshed with efforts to initiate talks to bring peace to the Korean peninsula . 
when the barter was announced , some analysts were sceptical if it would bear fruit . 
while barters circumvent the problem of cash payment , they are complicated because several parties may be involved , each with its own interests , and price fluctuations may affect the overall deal . 
a North Korean barter with Cargill , the world &apos;s largest grain trading firm , based in Minneapolis , would probably be the first direct American grain sale to North Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953 . 
earlier this week , traders in Tokyo said Pyongyang had thus far failed to deliver 4,000 tonnes of zinc in exchange for the 20,000 tonnes of Cargill wheat . 
&quot; These things happen quite often with North Korea these days , &quot; said a zinc trader at a European trade house in Tokyo . 
&quot; We once sent a vessel to buy 500 tonnes of zinc , but there was only 150 tonnes . 
we won &apos;t be signing any contracts directly with North Korea under the current circumstances .
