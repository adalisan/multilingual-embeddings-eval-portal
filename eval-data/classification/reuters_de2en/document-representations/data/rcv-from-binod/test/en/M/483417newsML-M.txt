Indonesian robusta coffee beans are beginning to come out but regional business has slowed sharply as exporters were sidelined by volatile markets in New York and London , regional traders said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The Indonesians are starting to offer more regularly . 
two or three weeks ago , you couldn &apos;t get an offer . 
now , regular offers are coming out of Indonesia , &quot; a senior trader for a European commodity house told Reuters . 
Robusta exports from the island of Sumatra will probably decline by up to 30 percent , while total coffee exports by Indonesia this year may slide 10-20 percent to around 260,000-285,000 tonnes , dealers said . 
&quot; Overall , we think the crop should be down 10-15 percent , &quot; one dealer said of the Indonesian coffee crop . 
excessive rains and strong winds last year pounded coffee trees . 
&quot; It knocked off a lot of the flowers , &quot; the dealer said . 
the crop will be in full-swing later this month , coffee traders said . 
the price of Indonesia &apos;s benchmark Grade 4 coffee , 80 defects , was seen by the trade at around US $ 1,400- $ 1,500 a tonne fob Lampung , unchanged from the previous week &apos;s quote . 
while more Indonesian robusta beans are becoming available , the recent volatility in international coffee markets kept most coffee players glued to the sidelines . 
&quot; In the interest of sanity for those of us in this business , they should close down the New York and London coffee markets for a week , &quot; one dealer said . 
at one point , prices in New York were hovering around 184.00 U.S. cents a lb during trading on Tuesday . 
&quot; When I looked at it five minutes later , it had gone back up to 194.00 cents , &quot; a trader said . 
the London robusta market was seen opening higher later on Wednesday , although regional dealers were divided as to how high it would go . 
&quot; I think London may be a little up , &quot; one trader said , adding prices for the May futures contract should rise by about $ 20- $ 30 . 
another dealer said , however , that &quot; London is due $ 100 up . 
the volatility has dampened sentiment in the region and business has slowed down to a crawl as a result . 
&quot; It &apos;s very , very slow , &quot; a coffee trader for a U.S. commodity company said . 
&quot; It just seems to be very , very quiet at the moment . 
another dealer for a European trading house said the amount of business it has been doing has been sharply lower . 
&quot; We &apos;ve not been doing much business in Vietnam . 
I don &apos;t think there &apos;s really a lot of offtake in the market , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Everyone is watching the market and they have decided they don &apos;t want any piece of it . 
the level of activity has been slow compared to the pace of exports over the last two months when large amounts of Vietnamese robusta beans were being shipped out . 
&quot; Vietnam had a very aggressive sales pace , &quot; a trader said . 
the price of Vietnam &apos;s key Grade 2 coffee , 8.0 percent black and broken , was quoted by dealers at $ 1,380- $ 1,400 a tonne fob Saigon port against last week &apos;s quote of $ 1,350- $ 1,400 a tonne fob on the same basis . 
with the bull rally in New York and London taking prices to fresh highs , the Thais took advantage by shipping out most of their coffee crop , dealers said . 
out of a total crop of some 60,000 tonnes , the Thais were said to have sold or committed some 50,000-55,000 tonnes . 
one trader said physical business may remain slow for the next few weeks after roasters and end-users went heavily long during the recent rally in coffee futures to ensure they have ample supplies . 
&quot; We could be in for a couple of months of low offtake , &quot; the trader said . 
the robusta coffee contract in the Singapore commodity Exchange ( SICOM ) was untraded on Tuesday . 
the May contract was indicated at $ 1,528 a tonne .
