rich countries came under pressure to live up to their commitments to finance conservation efforts in the developing world at the start of an international conference on biodiversity on Monday . 
&quot; There is compelling evidence that the developed countries , with the sole exception of Norway , are failing to meet their financial obligations , &quot; the Global Biodiversity Forum said in a statement released at the opening session . 
the forum , specialists from public and private groups , has drawn up recommendations for the Third Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity . 
over the next two weeks the conference will debate a broad agenda of topics including alternative sources of funding for biodiversity , forest management , agriculture practices , food safety , intellectual property rights and indigenous knowledge . 
the conference brings together delegates from 162 countries that signed the Convention on Biodiversity drafted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro . 
the treaty aims to protect the diversity of the world &apos;s ecosystems , species and genuses and to ensure that these resources are used in a sustainable manner and that the benefits are equitably shared . 
but participants said the new funds pledged in 1992 by industrialised nations to help implement the convention in developing countries have not been forthcoming . 
&quot; If you look at whether the developed countries have really come up with new money , the short answer is no , &quot; Rob Lake , senior policy officer of the biodiversity network BirdLife International , told Reuters . 
&quot; In 1992 there was a big peak in donations because everybody wanted to be seen to be green . 
but since then it &apos;s fallen off . 
Lake presented the conference with an analysis of data provided to him by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) . 
he found total OECD development aid peaked at $ 60.8 billion in 1992 and dropped to $ 56.7 billion in 1994 . 
preliminary data for the last two years suggest a similar downward trend , both in terms of global overseas development aid and in specific funds for biodiversity . 
experts said on Monday that because donor contributions were decreasing innovative financial mechanisms were needed to boost biodiversity programmes at a national level , such as debt swaps and tax incentives . 
they also called for an end to subsidies on environmentally unsound agricultural practices . 
&quot; Efforts should be redirected toward changing the incentive structure for private-sector actors , making it more profitable to conserve than to destroy biodiversity , &quot; Charles Barber , senior associate at the World Resources Institute , told Reuters . 
&quot; However , this is politically difficult because when you talk about trying to get rid of subsidies for industry , agriculture or commercial fisheries there are vested interests . 
you get people marching their cows down the Champs Elysees or piling their nets up in front of the Canadian Ministry of Fisheries .
