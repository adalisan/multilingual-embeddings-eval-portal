former U.S. secretary of state Alexander Haig on Friday condemned President Bill Clinton for ordering missile attacks against Iraq , saying the move would be extremely costly to Washington &apos;s international standing . 
&quot; I think it has been a major assault on America &apos;s credibility , &quot; Haig told BBC Radio after the attacks were launched to drive out Baghdad &apos;s forces from northern Iraq where Iraqi Kurds occupy a &quot; safe haven &quot; under U.N. protection . 
&quot; The portrayal of this as an American victory is wrong-headed and would be proven to be so in the very near future , &quot; said Haig , who served under former Republican President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s . 
the United States also expanded a no-fly zone over southern Iraq which was established after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Moslems from Saddam Hussein &apos;s forces . 
the U.S. attacks sparked strong opposition from Russia , China and France , which said its warplanes would not help police the expanded part of the southern no-fly zone . 
&quot; What we have done is gotten away with a phoney response which is cheap in the near term but which will be extremely costly to American credibility on the long term , &quot; said Haig . 
Republican commentators say the main reason Clinton launched the attacks was to boost his popularity ahead of presidential elections in November .
