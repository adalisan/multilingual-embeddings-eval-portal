Brent paper and CFD levels took a hammering in late morning on Monday as traders recognised the weakness on physical Brent crude and withdrew bids , traders said . 
Intermonth spreads , which started the day around Friday &apos;s late levels lost ground -- up to 10 cents -- Nov / Dec which started Monday at 32 / 38 cents traded recently at + 28 cents . 
Brent Dec / Jan which was bid up to + 59 cents earlier , was now offered at + 54 cents . 
the spread traded at + 55 cents . 
&quot; The market has just dumped in the last half hour . 
everyone seems to have just realised that Brent is going to trade at a very weak number . 
the bottom is falling out of the market after being hyped up last week , &quot; a trader with a major oil company said . 
one trading company has kept seven of the first 13 November loading Brent cargoes as they passed through the paper chains . 
this supported the market last week , until Friday , when the company showed no interest in obtaining Brent crude and the first five o &apos;clocking was seen . 
a Brent cargo ( loading November 10-12 ) traded on Friday at November Brent -20 cents . 
another cargo was heard offered at this level . 
in the south , Novorossisk reopened after being closed for the weekend , but the closure , due to high winds , did little to support a failing Urals market . 
traders saw five or six large Urals cargoes for sale and said Friday &apos;s deal at dated Brent -80 cents would be the &quot; starting point &quot; for the next deal . 
&quot; Every refiner in the Med is covered until at least the second half of November . 
we have all bought lots of Nigerian crude and have no room for Urals , &quot; one said .
