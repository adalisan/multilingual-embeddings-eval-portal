the Singapore gasoline market was stymied on Tuesday as Taiwan delayed the award of its September 95-octane tender . 
Taiwan &apos;s state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp &apos;s ( CPC ) buy tender closed on August 11 and is valid for two days , but it usually awards the cargo after a day . 
&quot; We are now considering whether to take one cargo , &quot; an official said . 
&quot; So far only one cargo was offered at a price that is acceptable . 
the results will be announced on Wednesday morning , the official said . 
earlier on Tuesday , another official said CPC received nine offers , four of which were from majors , at over $ 24.00 per barrel c + f Taiwan . 
&quot; The numbers are still not so good , &quot; he said . 
the official did not specify how much higher above $ 24 the best offer was . 
&quot; We will counter the price with the majors and traders , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If we can get $ 24.10 or $ 24.20 , we will consider it . 
he said the offer level was too high considering Monday &apos;s published Singapore fob quotes at $ 22.55 and the freight to Taiwan around $ 1.30 per barrel . 
CPC , which normally buys at least two 250,000-barrel cargoes monthly , has not purchased any September delivery barrels so far . 
it cancelled its last tender for Septmber 1-15 delivery due to high offers at around $ 25.30 per barrel c + f , then retendered for the whole month . 
&quot; The market is confused , &quot; said a trader in Singapore . 
&quot; If offers are around $ 24 , the market is healthy . 
but traders said freight was around 80 cents to $ 1.00 per barrel , placing Singapore fob quotes much higher than $ 22.60 offered for the 95-octane on Monday by a Swiss trader . 
the seller did not re-emerge on Tuesday but a European major came out to bid at $ 22.60 for September barrels . 
unleaded 92-octane was widely bid and offered at $ 22.00 / $ 22.80 by a Japanese trader and a U.S. major respectively . 
Naphtha edged up purely on the back of crude as the market remained lacklustre . 
&quot; Basically the market is very quiet and very weak , &quot; said a South Korean refiner . 
Naphtha September swaps rose by 15-20 cents per barrel to $ 21.35 / $ 21.50 .
