the dollar &apos;s decline against the mark put pressure on German shares in early trade on Monday , with export-driven industrial giant Daimler-Benz getting a double hit over fears of higher petrol prices . 
amid heavy trading volumes , Daimler suffered the biggest loss among blue chip shares in the bourse session to decline 3.50 marks , or 2.7 percent , to 128 marks by 0900 GMT . 
weak Bunds , unsettled by French bond declines , also helped depress the share market . 
Daimler &apos;s sharp decline followed a report in Germany &apos;s mass circulation Bild newspaper which said the government planned a sharp increase in petrol tax before the summer . 
but dealers also noted that the share had fallen below a technically important level of 130 marks , and was thus likely to recover its ground again in the short term . 
other car shares were also under mild pressure with BMW down 14.50 marks at 1,368 marks while Volkswagen AG , in line with the market trend , was down 10 marks at 1,055 marks . 
the few outperformers included the ever-volatile software group SAP AG , whose preferred stock was up 3.5 percent at 294.80 marks ahead of the company &apos;s quarterly earnings report due Tuesday . 
there were few market moving factors about as German March M3 money supply came in as expected at an annualised rate of 8.3 percent . 
dealers expected a rangebound session ahead with 3,300 DAX points remaining a key psychological support level for the market . 
below that , support was pegged at around 3,260 .
