Brazil , however , is expected to launch its well-flagged parallel bond on Monday -- a three-tranche bond totalling around $ 550 to $ 570 million equivalent .

the coupon will be determined at issue , while the benchmark would be the Brazilian 8.875 percent bond due in 2001 , issued last November .
