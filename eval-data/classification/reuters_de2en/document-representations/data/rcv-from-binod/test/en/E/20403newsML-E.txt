extra spending since the New Zealand government budget last May would make no significant difference to the previously forecast expenses trend , Finance Minister Bill birch said on Wednesday . 
speaking to a business luncheon in Wellington birch said since budget night the government had commited to more than $ 1 billion of extra spending over three years . 
contained in this was an increase of $ 353 million in population-based health and mental health funding , $ 492 million on education and $ 204 million from the reduction in superannuation surcharge threholds . 
the judgement against the government in a lawsuit over its 1987 sale of New Zealand Steel to investment company Equiticorp , which later collapsed , added $ 328 million to the list of expenses . 
this took the total to some $ 1.377 billion . 
the government has not said whether it will appeal the Equiticorp judgement . 
birch reiterated that as a result of the extra costs &quot; some downward adjustment will therefore be inevitable in the $ 3.9 billion surplus forecast for 1995-96 in the Budget &quot; . 
he said the accounts for 1995 / 96 due for release on September 12 would be the best seen in this country in modern history . 
&quot; The biggest surprise in the PREFU ( pre-election economic and fiscal update ) therefore is ... that none of the expenses ... makes any significant difference to the expenses trend previously forecast for the four years to 1999-2000 . 
costs , such as the $ 275 million three year bill for a recent pay settlement for secondary schoolteachers , were offset to some extent by reductions in finance costs . 
these included debt servicing savings from repayment of debt using the net $ 1.6 
billion from the sale of state-owned Forestry Corporation . 
he said given current policy settings surpluses were forecast to rise through the four years to 2000 and reach &quot; an unprecedented high &quot; by the turn of the century . 
birch said he expected a close-fought race in the lead up to the October 12 general election , but was optimistic that &quot; when the chips go down on voting day &quot; most voters would &quot; know what is at stake &quot; .
