Ambassador Madeleine Albright emerged on Wednesday as President Bill Clinton &apos;s top choice for secretary of state as administration officials said Clinton was close to picking his new foreign policy team . 
Albright , who would be the first woman to occupy such a senior U.S. post , was described by one official as as &quot; the leading candidate &quot; to succeed Warren Christopher , who plans to step down when Clinton starts his second term in January . 
but as speculation swirled in Washington over Clinton &apos;s selection for this and other key Cabinet posts , the White House cautioned that he had not made a final decision and no announcement was expected on Wednesday . 
&quot; On the question of Cabinet selections the president has made no final decisions , &quot; said White House spokesman Mike McCurry . 
&quot; He is actively considering that question . 
he continues to be in the same advanced state of deliberation that he was when I reported to you earlier this week . 
McCurry said Clinton planned to discuss Cabinet choices with Vice President Al Gore later Wednesday . 
there was speculation an announcement could come as early as Thursday . 
one government source said Albright , 59 , whose main office is at U.N. headquarters in New York , spent over three hours at the White House Tuesday evening and a diplomatic source said she had spoken with Clinton by telephone earlier in the day . 
another official said Albright &apos;s selection could still be affected by the final shape of Clinton &apos;s foreign policy team . 
&quot; He &apos;s close to signing off on all of the posts , but that isn &apos;t complete , &quot; the official said . 
the official said Anthony Lake , the White House national security adviser , is likely to leave his post -- possibly to become director of the Central Intelligence Agency . 
the current CIA director , John Deutch , most likely would be offered another Cabinet post , the official said -- stressing that &quot; one job affects another . 
&quot; Things are close to firming up , but they &apos;re not solid yet , &quot; this source said . 
Samuel Berger , currently Lake &apos;s deputy at the White House , was considered likely to be elevated to the sensitive national security post , officials said . 
defence Secretary William Perry has also announced he will leave by early next year , forcing Clinton to find replacements for the entire top level of his international brain-trust . 
Clinton has been under pressure to nominate women to high-profile posts in his administration , which will undergo an unusually large number of changes when he takes the oath of office for a second term on January 20 . 
support from women was crucial to his victory in the November 5 election . 
while men divided more evenly between the Democratic president and Republican Bob Dole , women voted overwhelmingly for Clinton . 
the secretary of state nomination would be an especially gratifying breakthrough for American women . 
it is the senior Cabinet post in protocol rankings and fourth in line to presidential succession under the U.S. Constitution , after the vice president , the speaker of the House of Representatives and the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate . 
one administration official said he was told on Tuesday that Clinton had settled on Albright but then decided to review the decision another time . 
&quot; He ( Clinton ) had made up his mind as of late yesterday and then decided to zero-base the whole thing , &quot; the official said . 
four years ago , Clinton had considered becoming the first president to name a woman as secretary of state but turned to the veteran Christopher , one of his chief confidants . 
Albright , the daughter of a Czechoslovak diplomat who moved to the United States after World War II , has been Washington &apos;s U.N. representative since February , 1993 . 
former Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell was once considered the frontrunner for the post but his chances faded after the November elections increased Republican control of the Senate and kept Republican control in the House . 
administration officials were concerned that the partisan fights Mitchell had led as Senate Democratic leader would undermine his ability to work with congressional Republicans .
