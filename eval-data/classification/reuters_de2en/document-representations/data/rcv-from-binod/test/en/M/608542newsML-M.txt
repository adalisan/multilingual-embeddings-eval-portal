IPE gas oil closed lower on Friday in an uneventful session as brokers squared positions ahead of the long holiday weekend in Britain . 
June gas oil settled $ 1.25 lower at $ 177.75 a tonne , while July Brent was 14 cents off at $ 20.04 a barrel at 1701 GMT . 
brokers said gas oil had been pressured lower by profit-taking and squaring ahead of the long weekend as well as losses on the NYMEX heating oil contract . 
they said Brent futures had been pushed further into negative territory by losses on NYMEX crude futures . 
both markets were seen jumpy with the expiry of product options on NYMEX making trading volatile . 
many traders said , however , the fact the July Brent contract was clinging to the $ 20 level was an encouraging sign . 
&quot; This market is well supported . 
it dipped below $ 20 but quickly bounced back , &quot; one said . 
both the IPE and NYMEX are closed on Monday due to the Memorial Day holiday in the United States and the Spring Bank holiday in Britain .
