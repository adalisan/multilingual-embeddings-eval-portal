Argentina &apos;s threatened COPA America boycott has been averted but the crisis has highlighted the often bizarre organisation of one the world &apos;s leading international soccer tournaments . 
coach Daniel Passarella had threatened to take his team back to Buenos Aires following a change in the rules which could have sent them to play their quarter-final at high altitude in La Paz . 
Argentina finished second in group A after drawing with Paraguay on Tuesday and according to the original fixture list were due to meet the second-placed team in group B , Bolivia &apos;s group , in Sucre at 2,700 metres altitude . 
but unknown to Passarella , organisers had announced earlier on Tuesday that if Bolivia finished second in group B , the game would be switched to La Paz , at 3,600 metres . 
a furious Passarella , who got full backing from his players , said : &quot; You can &apos;t change the rules during the competition . 
in the event , Bolivia beat Uruguay 1-0 to finish top of their group , sending Argentina to Sucre for a quarter-final against Peru , who finished second in group B. 
that problem was resolved but others possibly remain . 
the most striking is the move to allocate two possible venues for the final , depending on who qualifies . 
if the hosts reach the final , it will be in La Paz . 
otherwise , it will be in the country &apos;s second city of Santa Cruz , at sea level . 
the same applies to one of the semifinals , which could be in La Paz , with Bolivia , or Cochabamba , at 2,600 metres &apos; altitude , without them . 
FIFA , world soccer &apos;s governing body , last year considered banning the Bolivians from playing World Cup qualifiers in La Paz because of its height . 
they backed down but ruled that members from visiting teams must be released by their clubs at least 10 days before the game to give them time to adjust . 
even so , three weeks is generally considered necessary for full adaptation to the unusual conditions in La Paz . 
Jamaica recently played Bolivia in a friendly in the city and found conditions so difficult that they stopped taking the game seriously . 
the Jamaicans burst out laughing when Bolivian players raced past them and collapsed on the ground , pretending to faint , during their 6-0 defeat . 
Eduardo Deluca , secretary-general of the South American Football Confederation ( CSF ) , said on Thursday it was normal to give privileges to the host nation , &quot; just like we did in 1993 in Ecuador and 1995 in Uruguay &quot; . 
the timing of the contest , in the middle of a World Cup qualifying competition , has also angered many coaches , and half the teams have responded by bringing &quot; B &quot; teams . 
CSF spokesman Jorge Barraza , however , blamed the national federations for agreeing to an enormous World Cup qualifying group , in which nine teams play each other twice . 
&quot; This COPA was announced nearly 10 years ago , long before the World Cup matches , &quot; he said . 
over-priced tickets have been blamed for keeping the public away , and many games have been played in half-empty stadiums . 
there has even been confusion over the number of goals in the tournament &apos;s history . 
Julio Cesar Balidivieso &apos;s goal for Bolivia on Wednesday was widely announced as being the 2000th but on Thursday , the CSF said it was only the 1,999th . 
in spite of everything , there has been some dramatic football , the highlights including Brazil &apos;s spectacular 3-2 win over the valiant Mexicans , when they came from 2-0 down . 
and , as Barraza pointed out , South America does not have a monopoly on strange organisation . 
&quot; Look at the formula for the World Cup games in Europe , with the all the mathematics involved and those games between small countries , &quot; he said .
