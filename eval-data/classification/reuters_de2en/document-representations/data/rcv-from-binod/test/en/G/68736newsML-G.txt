here are brief profiles of the two Thai politicians seen as most likely to replace Banharn Silpa-archa who said on Saturday he would resign from his post within seven days . 
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh is seen as the front-runner but Amnuay Viravan could be chosen as a compromise due to his strong economic background , political analysts said . 
CHAVALIT YONGCHAIYUDH - An orchestrator of Thai politics for decades both in and out of uniform , General Chavalit , 64 , has a strong eye on the nation &apos;s top job . 
a former army chief and current defence minister in Banharn &apos;s coalition government , Chavalit heads the New aspiration Party -- the second largest in the coalition -- which he helped found in 1990 after retiring from the military . 
Chavalit &apos;s party led coalition partners in making a surprise demand that Banharn resign before a no-confidence vote against him on Saturday . 
since being named defence minister after a July , 1995 , general election , the ambitious Chavalit has often been touted as a candidates to be the next prime minister . 
he has been seen using the defence portfolio to strengthen his own power base , managing military reshuffles to place officers loyal to him in key positions and supporting big-budget military procurement to keep favour with the armed forces . 
however , he has said he would like to become premier &quot; gracefully &quot; through a fresh election . 
AMNUAY VIRAVAN - Respected economist and former banker Amnuay Viravan , 64 , is relatively new to Thai politics having entered the fray only in 1992 . 
to launch his political career , Amnuay quit his job as head of Thailand &apos;s biggest bank , Bangkok Bank plc , and aligned with Chavalit &apos;s New aspiration Party . 
the intelligent but soft-spoken Amnuay has had a distinguished 38-year career as a government economist , corporate executive , banker and cabinet minister . 
Amnuay now heads the small Nam Thai party , which he formed in 1994 after leaving the NAP . 
recognising his skills , Banharn made him deputy prime minister , foreign minister and economic affairs supremo . 
Amnuay is a champion of free trade and privatisation .
