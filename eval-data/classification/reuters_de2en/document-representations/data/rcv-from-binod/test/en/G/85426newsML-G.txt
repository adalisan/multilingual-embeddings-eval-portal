the new chief prosecutor at the Bosnian war crimes tribunal urged the international community on Monday to give NATO-led forces in Bosnia a fresh mandate to arrest indicted war criminals and send them to stand trial in The Hague . 
Canadian judge Louise Arbour , who takes over the U.N. tribunal on Tuesday from Richard Goldstone of South Africa , said the tribunal &apos;s credibility depended on reinforcing the political will to help it bring justice to the war-torn region . 
&quot; It &apos;s clearly a question of developing the political will to give IFOR a mandate consistent with the will of the Security Council -- and that must include arresting indicted criminals , &quot; she told reporters at the tribunal &apos;s Hague headquarters . 
&quot; I &apos;m very sceptical that of all the tasks that could have been given to ( the NATO-led Implementation Force ) IFOR , this one was just too hard . 
Arbour , who moves to the Netherlands after five years on the Court of Appeal in the Canadian province of Ontario , said the primary obligation to arrest lay with those states which had suspects in their jurisdiction . 
&quot; But when there is an alternative ( like IFOR ) , we must press extremely hard for the international community ... on site , to itself cooperate fully with the tribunal , &quot; she said . 
Arbour &apos;s predecessor Goldstone echoed these sentiments in a speech to the U.N. Security Council in New York on Monday on his last day in office . 
he said the lack of NATO action to seize war criminals was the single largest area of disappointment during his tenure as chief war crimes prosecutor and added he would press for more action to carry out arrests in Bosnia . 
&quot; I &apos;m very concerned that it can vitally affect the very future of the tribunal , &quot; he told the Security Council . 
Goldstone stressed the importance of arrests taking place during this year . 
&quot; It &apos;s an important matter which I &apos;m going to raise ( with the Security Council ) ... I would hope that any continuing military force will be given very explicit instructions to go out and arrest people . 
Arbour also urged tougher IFOR measures in the light of mounting frustration at the delay in apprehending indicted war criminals , most notably former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic . 
&quot; ( What happens from now ) will depend very much on the political will to renew an IFOR-type mandate with much more pro-active measures with respect to arrests . 
&quot; It will also depend on how those states who have a responsibility to arrest ( criminals ) respond to threats , coersion or rewards for good behaviour . 
she said victims of the Bosnian carnage should not be allowed to forget what happened during the 3-1 / 2 year war . 
&quot; As time passes , we &apos;re going to start seeing the very sad , but very real , phenomenon of victims asserting that they would be better off forgetting . 
&quot; We must resist a tendency to shrug the shoulders and have an amnesty . 
I will be there encouraging that we not do that , &quot; although she admitted it was difficult to get this message across to &quot; people who believe they are immune to barbarism . 
Arbour , who also becomes chief prosecutor at the Rwanda tribunal investigating alleged genocide that left up to one million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead in a 1994 civil war , thanked Goldstone for his &quot; pioneering &quot; work in getting the tribunal &apos;s started and declared herself ready to take on the job 
I will not wait four years for criminal litigation to take place . 
&quot; We have indicted many people with the most serious crimes . 
I intend to bring every single one of them to trial . 
the Yugoslav tribunal , set up by the U.N. in 1993 as the first international body for the prosecution of war criminals since the trials at Nuremburg and Tokyo after World War II , has indicted over 70 Serbs , Croats and Moslems with war crimes . 
only seven are in custody .
