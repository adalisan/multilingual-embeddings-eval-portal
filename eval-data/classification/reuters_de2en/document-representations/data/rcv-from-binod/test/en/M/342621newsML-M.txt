the Indonesian rupiah edged up against the dollar in slow early trading on Wednesday on the back of some tightening in the money market , dealers said . 
but some said early liquidity concern was exaggerated . 
it &apos;s merely that people are rushing to square overnight swap positions which triggered overnight money to increase , &quot; one dealer said . 
the local bank dealer said offshore operators were seen entering the local market late on Tuesday by buying up Tom / next swaps to a high 0.65 / 0.70 points . 
&quot; But local operators could not square the entire exposure , while some were speculating for a lower rate on Wednesday as overnight money fell to 10.0 percent late on Tuesday , &quot; he said . 
&quot; As everybody moves to cover his short position early this morning , rates are being driven up . 
I think short-term rates will decline later because there is sufficient supply at present , &quot; he added . 
overnight swap rose to 0.60 / 0.65 from 0.50 / 0.56 points and Tom / next to 0.70 from 0.5 / 0.6 points . 
overnight money rose to 13.0 / 13.5 percent from 9.5 / 10.0 percent at the opening , with some easing potential . 
dealers said overall sentiment on the rupiah remained firm as operators focussed on a possible tightening in the money market on month-end factors , the lunar new year and the EID al-Fitr celebrations in early February . 
the local bank dealer said a temporary slower central bank rupiah depreciation and weekly swap costs of some 3.5 points caused operators to go short in dollars . 
dealers said longer-term swap rates were relatively stable compared with Tuesday . 
one-month swaps were at 13.25 / 13.75 , two at 23.00 / 24.00 , three at 37.00 / 38.00 and six at 74.5 / 75.5 points . 
Bank Indonesia raised its intervention band by one point to 2,370 / 2.562 and the conversion band also by one point to 2,370 / 2,418 on Tuesday . 
the central bank depreciated the rupiah by only two points last week after lowering it by four points the previous week .
