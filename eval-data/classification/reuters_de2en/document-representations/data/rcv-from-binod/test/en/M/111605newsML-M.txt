CBOT wheat futures rebounded from early lows , underpinned by USDA &apos;s cut in its forecast for 1996-97 U.S. ending stocks of wheat , traders said . 
USDA Friday said the supply of wheat in the United States at the end of the 1996-97 crop year would total 470 million bushels , below the previous forecast for 506 million . 
wheat was pressured early by a sharp drop in corn and soybeans linked to USDA &apos;s projections for greater-than-expected supplies of those commodities . 
at 1010 CDT , wheat was 1 / 2 to one cent per bushel higher , with December up 1 / 2 at $ 4.24-1 / 2 .
