Philippine banks continued to shy away from the secondary market for T-bills on Friday after the Central Bank raised its key overnight rate , traders said . 
banks were just marking time to await the results of the auction on Monday when rates would move up , they said . 
&quot; We &apos;re expecting at least a 30 basis-point increase from the previous auction , &quot; a foreign bank dealer said . 
the Central Bank on Thursday lifted its overnight borrowing rate to 15 percent from 12.75 percent to protect the peso from speculative attacks triggered by the renewed weakness in the Thai baht . 
banks were trying to sell their T-bills ahead of Monday &apos;s auction but they found no buyers , traders said . 
meanwhile , the average interbank call loan rate jumped to 15.03125 percent from 12.8125 percent in step with the increase in the Central Bank &apos;s rate . 
done rates moved from 15.5 to 15.03125 percent , with volume higher at 21.25 billion pesos from 18.47 billion pesos . 
the market had 28 lenders and 21 borrowers . 
according to a Reuters poll of five financial institutions , banks quoted higher bid and offer rates for T-bills . 
sellers of T-bills gave quotes of 10.35 / 10.65 percent for the three-month bills ; 10.70 / 10.90 percent for the six months ; and 11.20 / 11.25 percent for the one-year bills .
