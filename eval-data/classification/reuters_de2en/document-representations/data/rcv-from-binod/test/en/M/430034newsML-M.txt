investment interest in Estonian shares is broadening , with European investors joining British and U.S. funds on the Tallinn bourse , shedding fears that the market is too risky , analysts say . 
what is more , the focus is widening from just banking stocks , analysts say . 
with political and macro-economic worries subsiding , confidence about investing in Estonia and its Baltic neighbours , Latvia and Lithuania , is on the rise . 
&quot; People want an exposure on the so far positive side of economic development , &quot; said Nomura &apos;s London-based Claus Mansfeldt , associate director of emerging markets in investment banking . 
&quot; We are finally seeing some interest from Scandinavia and European money is coming in . 
Estonia &apos;s bourse has seen rapid growth since early 1996 , outpacing its neighbours , although expansion has been reined in by fears of economic and political instability . 
despite the rise in foreign interest , figures from the Tallinn Stock Exchange show that 60 percent of total investments in 1996 came from Estonians . 
Tallinn Stock Exchange spokeswoman Helo Meigas said the bourse &apos;s index , which was established last May at 100 , rose to 160 by the end of December when market capitalisation was US $ 800 million . 
it now stands at 213 . 
analysts said the banking sector remained the focus on Estonia &apos;s bourse , partly because of a lack of alternatives . 
trader Kari Salonen from Williams de Broe in Helsinki said he was seeing considerable interest from Britain and central Europe in Estonian banking shares which were performing well . 
&quot; Estonian banks are looking like a good buy at the moment , and we are particularly interested in the top three ( Hansapank , Forekspank , and the Savings bank ) , &quot; Salonen told Reuters . 
&quot; I think the bank shares could rise quite a bit this year . 
but Estonia is really lacking any new companies . 
&quot; So far there have not been that many pure corporates providing the necessary exposure ... so people have had to invest mainly in the banks , &quot; Mansfeldt said . 
&quot; But there will be change this year and next when private sector corporates as well as the government do some substantial privatisations . 
Mansfeldt said the industrial and transportation sectors in Estonia were of particular interest . 
other companies of interest were confectionery group Kalev , car seatbelt maker Norma and Sako breweries . 
&quot; I expect we &apos;ll see a reweighting of the balance on the exchange towards more industrial , transport-related companies , &quot; he said . 
analysts said several key events in 1996 had fuelled interest in Estonia and other Baltic bourses and forecast greater overseas participation . 
these events included Vilniaus Bank &apos;s GDR issue and international share issues by Estonia &apos;s Savings bank and Lithuania &apos;s Birzai Milk . 
&quot; These deals are not plentiful or very large in size but they still have great novelty value , &quot; Mansfeldt said . 
&quot; I think there will be a lot of additional interest from Europe -- from Germany , Holland , Switzerland , Austria and Poland -- over the next year or two . 
Elina Timonen from Merita Bank also saw wider interest . 
&quot; Interest has increased especially from central Europe , from Germany in particular , &quot; she said .
