German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has invited East Timorese Nobel Peace laureate Bishop Carlos Belo for a meeting during his current visit to Jakarta , German delegation sources said on Monday . 
it was not immediately known whether Belo had accepted the invitation . 
the Norwegian Nobel Committee early this month awarded the peace prize jointly to Belo and to self-exiled East Timorese resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta . 
Indonesian President Suharto met Belo during a recent visit to East Timor but made no mention of the award to the bishop . 
Kohl arrived in Indonesia on Saturday , and had official talks with Suharto during the formal part of his visit on Monday . 
he is due to leave for the Philippines on Tuesday morning . 
Indonesians generally have acknowledged Belo as a worthy recipient of the peace prize but have been bitterly critical of the award to Ramos Horta . 
Ramos-Horta has called on Kohl to raise the East Timor issue with Suharto during his visit to Jakarta .
