the French government will draw on a budget provision opened in 1991 to fund advance premium payouts of 15 billion francs in 1997 to around 1.7 billion non-tax-paying PEP ( Plan d &apos;Epargne Populaire ) savings plan holders , a government budget document said . 
the government move , designed to boost consumption to fire up the economy , involves making advance payouts next year to non-tax-paying holders of PEP savings plans opened in 1990 . 
&quot; The 15 billion francs will be drawn from the provision opened over the years since 1991 in the state budget , &quot; the document said . 
those who opened such accounts in 1991 , 1992 and between January 1 1993 and September 22 1993 would get their premium payouts in 1998 , 1999 and 2000 respectively , it said . 
&quot; The aim of this measure to to all the most modest savers to call more rapidly on the premiums owed to them by the state and thereby bolster consumption , &quot; it said .
