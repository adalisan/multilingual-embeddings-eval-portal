emerging markets debt traded mixed on Tuesday as treasuries &apos; losses pulled most Bradys lower , traders said . 
spreads over treasuries were wider for most countries , suffering from a lack of buyer interest after the Memorial Day holiday , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s been pretty quiet the last three days , &quot; said a trader at a U.S. investment bank . 
&quot; customer flows are on the lighter side , although I think most people are still on the defensive right now . 
late on Tuesday , benchmark Brazil &quot; C &quot; bonds had given back some of their recent gains to stand off 3 / 4 at 78-7 / 8 bid . 
Argentina pars were off 1 / 2 at 66-5 / 8 bid , and Mexico pars had dipped 5 / 8 to 74-1 / 4 bid . 
&quot; I think we &apos;re just in a consolidation phase , &quot; another trader said . 
&quot; We &apos;re still pretty close to all-time tight spreads , &quot; he added . 
Ecuador Brady bonds offered the day &apos;s best performance , with PDIs up 7 / 8 at 63-1 / 2 bid and discounts up 5 / 8 at 69-1 / 8 . 
&quot; Ecuador traded a little higher on the referendum news , &quot; one trader said . 
preliminary returns from Sunday &apos;s plebiscite showed between 62 and 65 percent of Ecuador voters endorsed interim president Fabian Alarcon and 74 percent supported the February ouster of President Abdala Bucaram . 
U.S.-based analysts said the poll soothed fears about Ecuador &apos;s near-term political scenario , but they said Alarcon still did not have the popular support required to implement harsh austerity measures . 
among losing issues , Venezuela and Panama paper tallied some of the greatest losses . 
traded volume was thin for both countries &apos; debt , however , traders said . 
Venezuela pars were off 7 / 8 at 75-3 / 8 bid , and Panama pars were down 1-1 / 4 at 58 bid . 
&quot; pars tend to outperform on up treasuries days and underperform on down treasuries days , &quot; one trader said . 
elsewhere , Bulgaria IABs were off 1 / 8 at 67-5 / 8 bid , dollar-denominated Russian Vnesh loans were off 1 / 8 at 85-7 / 8 and Phillippines pars were down 3 / 8 at 86-3 / 4 . 
the bellwether 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was off 15 / 32 to yield 7.03 percent .
