German shares shrugged off overnight worries on Wall Street over the course of bourse trade on Thursday and rose to within striking distance of further record highs . 
the rise came on the back of a supportive dollar , which outweighed uncertainty in a moribund Bund market . 
dealers said the rise was partly due to the market righting itself after falling on Wednesday after comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan . 
the DAX index , which measures floor trade in 30 German blue-chips , ended up 38.85 points , or 1.20 percent , at 3,276.72 points , not far off a life high of 3,287.79 points . 
the Dow Jones Industrial Index on Wall street fell 0.78 percent overnight after Greenspan said the U.S. central bank was increasingly concerned about the impact on the economy of surging equity prices . 
&quot; The dollar is the most important factor right now driving the market and that has a heavier impact than Greenspan , &quot; said a trader at a Munich bank . 
the firmer dollar was sparking foreign interest in the market , particularly in chemical and carmaker shares . 
despite the early gains , traders said the market advance would be capped by a weaker German debt market and reluctance to put on new positions ahead of Wall Street &apos;s opening . 
among specific shares , Bayer AG was one of the top gainers , ending the session up 2.40 marks at 71.40 marks after the chemical and pharmaceuticals group said it had &quot; a good dozen &quot; products under development that would add from 10 billion marks in new sales . 
Karstadt AG ended up 21.50 marks at 552.50 marks after Germany &apos;s Wirtschaftwoche magazine said on Wednesday that major shareholders in the retailer wanted to replace Karstadt chief executive Walter Deuss . 
traders noted Karstadt advanced despite expectations for the retailer to post a 1996 loss of nearly 300 million marks and plans to close more stores . 
shares in truck manufacturer man AG slipped 8.50 marks to 434 marks after the group said it was aiming in its 1996 / 97 business year to earn a profit about equal to year-earlier results despite a drop in first-half profit . 
man said group net profit for the last six months of 1996 had fallen to 80 million marks from 110 million marks .
