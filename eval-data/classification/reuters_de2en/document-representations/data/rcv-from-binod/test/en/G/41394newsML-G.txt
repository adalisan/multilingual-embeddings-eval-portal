Federal authorities Monday were investigating the cause of a fire that destroyed a predominantly black church in the California state capital , officials said . 
the blaze at the New Home Missionary Baptist Church in Sacramento broke out a few minutes before midnight Sunday and took 30 firefighters an hour to put out , fire officials said . 
the church was declared a &quot; total loss &quot; and damage was estimated at $ 400,000 , officials said . 
a firefighter and a civilian were injured , the Sacramento Fire Department said , but gave no details . 
agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( ATF ) were helping the Sacramento Fire Department investigate the cause of the blaze , ATF spokesman Ed Gleba said . 
he said it was too early to say if the fire was arson or accidental . 
the fire broke out in a construction area where an extension to the church was being built , Gleba said . 
he said investigators brought sniffer dogs but were waiting for rubble to be removed before they could get to the site of the fire . 
authorities have investigated more than 70 fires at U.S. churches since the start of 1995 , many of them at black churches in the South . 
investigators believe some of the fires were racially motivated . 
Gleba said California has not been a target for church burnings over the past year .
