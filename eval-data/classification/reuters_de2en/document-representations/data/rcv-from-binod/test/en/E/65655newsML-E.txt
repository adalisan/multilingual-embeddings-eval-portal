labour Party Finance spokesman Michael Cullen said on Thursday a Labour government would change the Reserve Bank &apos;s inflation target to -1-3 percent from 0-2 percent , but only as a holding action ahead of a review of how to measure inflation . 
he told a news briefing a review would take six to 12 months . 
he said the 0-2 percent inflation target was &quot; clearly too tight &quot; . 
&quot; We are not building in a change in the mid-point , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That &apos;s only a holding action while we review how to measure inflation . 
we are not convinced it ( the Reserve Bank &apos;s method of measuring underlying inflation ) is the best measure , &quot; he said in answer to questions . 
Cullen said Labour &apos;s fiscal projections adopted Treasury &apos;s growth projections and it had not built in any change to growth from the impact of its policies which were &quot; likely to be self-balancing &quot; . 
&quot; There is no reason any party should use figures other than Treasury &apos;s forecasts , &quot; he said , adding that was the only way different parties &apos; policies could be compared . 
he said Labour had earlier committed to a bottom line on net debt reduction rather than a level of fiscal surplus . 
that bottom line was to reduce by an average of two percent net debt as a percentage of GDP for each of the next three years . 
longer term , he expected government revenues to stabilise about 35 percent of GDP and spending around 34 percent , with the bulk of the operating balance being dedicated to a superannuation fund . 
he said the balance in the superannuation fund meant that while Labour &apos;s fiscal position was initially looser , &quot; we are committed to a slightly tighter stance in the long term potentially than are National &quot; . 
labour was not &quot; wedded to a figure of 20 percent of GDP &quot; as a measure of prudent debt levels , Cullen said , adding that at 21.8 percent by the year 2000 &quot; we are into the prudent level of debt &quot; . 
in answer to questioning Cullen said he personally believed the exchange rate would drop &quot; under almost any scenario &quot; . 
he would not be drawn on the level of expenditure or fiscal balance he would consider prudent and therefore a bottom line in coalition talks .
