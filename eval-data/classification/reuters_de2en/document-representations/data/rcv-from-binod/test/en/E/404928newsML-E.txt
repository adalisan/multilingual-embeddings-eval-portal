India &apos;s coalition government , split between populists and free traders , releases its first full-fledged budget plan this week in a test of its commitment to economic reform and financial prudence . 
finance Minister P. Chidambaram , who on Friday will present the budget for the 1997 / 98 fiscal year starting on April 1 , has to walk a tightrope between communists and liberals who often seem strange bedfellows in the fractious 15-party government . 
Chidambaram &apos;s room for manoeuvre is constricted by the sometimes contradictory demands of economic growth and social programmes which are the twin priorities of Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda &apos;s nine-month-old government , analysts said . 
the objectives are often at odds . 
the government &apos;s financial advisers say economic growth requires spending cuts and increased private investment -- measures which fly in the face of subsidy programmes and public sector firms dear to the Left . 
&quot; The elbow room is rather limited , &quot; said former central bank governor R.N. 
Malhotra , now chairman of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations . 
the finance minister received good grades last July when he presented a truncated 1996 / 97 budget . 
but experts said the challenge now is greater because of mounting economic ills . 
&quot; Everything is looking down now and investor confidence is at one of its lowest points , &quot; former finance minister Manmohan Singh said in an interview in Outlook magazine . 
among the most eagerly awaited numbers in the budget are the estimate of the fiscal deficit as a share of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 1996 / 97 , and the target for 1997 / 98 . 
analysts said the ratio , 5.8 percent in 1995 / 96 , could come down to between 5.1 and 5.4 percent in the current year . 
but the 1997 / 98 target is clouded by spending pressures . 
just this week the government added $ 2.2 billion in food subsidies for the poor . 
a commission recently recommended raising annual payouts to civil servants by $ 2.4 billion . 
&quot; New expenditure pressures in the budget are going to be strong , &quot; Malhotra said . 
&quot; pressure on the deficit will continue . 
in an annual review of the economy released on Tuesday , the Finance Ministry drew a bead on the most pressing problems . 
the Economic Survey called attention to the burgeoning oil pool deficit -- money the government owes state oil companies for selling petroleum products at below world market prices . 
the shortfall , set to reach 155 billion rupees ( $ 4.3 billion ) at the end of March , has ballooned despite a decision last July -- hotly contested by communists in DEVE Gowda &apos;s coalition -- to increase domestic petroleum product prices . 
in Tuesday &apos;s report , the Finance Ministry came out for a price increase and the phasing out of price controls . 
analysts said the budget might introduce a measure of reform in the oil subsidy programme but a price rise would have to wait . 
the budget was expected to address other pressing concerns , including infrastructure bottlenecks and sluggish exports . 
economists have urged bold measures to attract greater private investment , domestic and foreign , into critical core industries such as power , telecommunications and roads . 
NatWest Markets said the budget could seek to promote the development of a more mature debt market to fund infrastructure . 
Chidambaram was expected to try to raise revenues , widening the taxpayer base by lowering marginal rates and perhaps imposing new consumption levies and even taxing rich farmers . 
but analysts said there was no assurance he would scrap a minimum tax on firms which is resisted by many businessmen . 
nor was there any guarantee he would bow to foreign pressure and open up the insurance market , or clear up ambiguities over policies governing foreign investment in airlines . 
&quot; Mr Chidambaram will be able to go only some distance on the reforms path and no further , &quot; the Asian Age newspaper said .
