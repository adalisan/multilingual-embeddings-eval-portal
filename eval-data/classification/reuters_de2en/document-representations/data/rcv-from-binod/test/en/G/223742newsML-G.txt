Turkish State Minister Lutfi Esengun said on Thursday Iraqi oil would begin flowing through a trans-Turkey pipeline by December 15 under a U.N. deal that allows Baghdad to sell oil worth $ 2 billion over six months to buy food and medicine . 
&quot; Iraqi oil will start flowing by December 15 at the latest through the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline , &quot; Esengun told reporters after a cabinet meeting . 
&quot; All remaining obstacles will be removed in the next 15 days and the pipeline will become operational and begin carrying oil , &quot; he said , without giving details . 
Turkey earlier said the twin pipeline from Iraq &apos;s Kirkuk oilfields to Turkey &apos;s southern Ceyhan terminal were technically ready to handle the Iraqi oil sales under the U.N. plan , which Iraq said on Monday it had fully agreed . 
Turkish officials were not available for comment on the status of the oil trapped inside the pipeline and whether the 12 tanks at the Ceyhan terminal were completely full of oil . 
officials earlier said there were 12 million barrels of oil inside the twin pipelines , about 3.8 million barrels belonging to Turkey . 
they said the thinner , 40-inch-diameter , but longer pipeline would be used for Iraqi sales . 
this 986-km ( 616-mile ) line can carry up to 46.5 million tonnes a year .
