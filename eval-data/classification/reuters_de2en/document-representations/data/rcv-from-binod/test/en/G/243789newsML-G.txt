Austria braced for a fresh round of letter bomb attacks after a package addressed to the step-mother of Interior Minister Caspar Einem exploded in Vienna on Monday . 
but the device failed to reach its target as the bombers sent the letter bomb to a house vacated by Einem &apos;s 66-year-old widowed step-mother , Lotte Ingrisch , a year ago . 
no one was injured in the blast . 
&quot; Obviously , they were trying to get my step-mother as a way of hitting out at me , &quot; Einem told Austrian television . 
&quot; All Austrians have to be very careful . 
we are not giving in . 
Austria has been hit by five waves of racially-motivated letter bomb attacks since December 1993 . 
Monday &apos;s device appeared timed to coincide with the third anniversary of the first letter bomb explosion . 
a shadowy organisation calling itself the Bajuwarian Liberation Army ( bla ) has claimed responsibility for sending more than 20 packages rigged to explosive devices which have injured more than a dozen foreigners or people associated with refugees or immigrants in Austria and Germany . 
Robert Sturm , the chief of the interior ministry bomb investigation unit , warned Austrians to be on their guard for further letter bomb attacks . 
&quot; This is the beginning of the sixth series of letter bombs , &quot; Sturm told reporters after visiting the scene of the letter bomb explosion in the Favoriten district in east Vienna . 
a woman , believed to be a member of an astrological society , alerted police after receiving a suspicious package . 
the device exploded after bomb disposal experts took the package away at around 6 p.m. ( 1700 GMT ) . 
the package first sent to Ingrisch &apos;s former home was returned to the purported sender . 
the perpetrators used the address of an astrological society in Favoriten , believing Ingrisch to have an interest in the science . 
Ingrisch denied she followed astrology but claims to be a spiritualist , and says she is able to contact her late composer husband , Gottfried von Einem , who died in July , aged 78 . 
she used to write librettos for Von Einem &apos;s operas . 
Ingrisch said she was not afraid of dying because of her spiritualist beliefs but was always worried about her step-son . 
&quot; I am often afraid that the minister will get hurt , &quot; she said , adding that she also firmly backed foreigners &apos; rights . 
far-right Freedom Party spokeswoman Helene Partik-Pable condemned the attack , calling the bomb the work of a madman . 
the bla has claimed it was also behind the murder in February last year of four gypsy men , who were killed in a booby-trap bomb blast when they tried to remove a racist sign , reading &quot; Roma ( gypsies ) back to India &quot; from their village . 
police chiefs have come under fire for failing to make any arrests connected to the letter bomb campaign or for the gypsy murders . 
two neo-Nazis arrested in December 1993 on suspicion of involvement in the attacks were acquitted last December . 
police officials suspect neo-Nazis to be behind the bombing campaign but government sources have indicated the bla may consist of a few middle-aged fanatics . 
they are believed to be obsessed with reuniting German-speaking peoples in Bavaria , the Alps and along the Danube River -- a distinct region which existed between the sixth and 12th centuries .
