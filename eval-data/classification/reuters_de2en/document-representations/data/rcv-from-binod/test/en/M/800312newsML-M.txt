dated and forward Brent crude jumped early on Thursday ahead of the expiry of the September IPE contract but other North Sea grades were quiet as traders waited for next month &apos;s loading programmes . 
an Aug 28-30 Brent cargo was sold to a Wall Street trader for Sept Brent -5 cents , seven cents firmer than a deal on Thursday , but some traders said the deal was aimed at benefitting a related swaps position . 
&quot; It looks like a CFD play to me , &quot; said a trader . 
other players pegged the market closer to Sept Brent -20 cents , the level traded on Tuesday . 
the Sept / Oct intermonth spread fetched -7 cents , four cents firmer than deals late on Wednesday , and Oct / Nov also edged higher to trade at -10 and -9 cents . 
Brent CFDs got a modest lift from the firmer dated deals in the last two days , next week &apos;s Aug 18-22 dates trading at Oct Brent -25 and -23 cents , dealers said . 
both Aug 29-31 cargoes due to turn wet on Thursday were kept by their respective equity holders , Shell and Exxon . 
traders said the release of the September Brent loading programme showing the equivalent of three fewer full cargoes than in August lent some fundamental support . 
forties loadings next month are also expected to fall , by 2.68 million barrels or the equivalent of five standard cargoes , according to the programme released to equity producers overnight . 
other North Sea markets were thin with few August barrels still to be placed and loading schedules for next month still being finalised . 
in the Mediterranean sour Russian Urals was still pegged around -90 cents a barrel , basis CIF Augusta , with early cargoes commanding a premium to late August barrels .
