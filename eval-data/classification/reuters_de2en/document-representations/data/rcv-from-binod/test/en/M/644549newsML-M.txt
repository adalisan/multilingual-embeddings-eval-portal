Shenzhen shares ended with heavy losses on Friday , hit by Beijing &apos;s ban on state bank funds entering the country &apos;s stock markets in the latest move to clamp down on speculative trading , brokers said . 
the domestic currency A share index dived 32.28 points or 6.83 percent to 440.21 on turnover of 12.7 billion yuan , compared with 7.3 billion on Thursday . 
Beijing on Thursday ordered state banks to begin unwinding positions on the stock exchanges on Friday and to cease trading in treasury debt repurchase agreements ( repo ) . 
&quot; The market will need about two weeks to digest the news but I doubt it will soon return to recent highs , &quot; said one analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities in Shenzhen . 
under the new measures , issued by the People &apos;s Bank of China , the central bank , all state banks must liquidate their positions within 10 days . 
analysts said the B index could lose five to 10 percent in the near future . 
as much as half the stock market &apos;s liquidity had come from banks via the repo market , analysts said . 
&quot; By drying up the bank funds , liquidity on both the stock markets and the debt markets will fall significantly , &quot; an analyst at PBI Securities said . 
the government has recently banned from the stock markets other sources of so-called hot money , such as speculative funds from state enterprises and listed firms . 
before the crackdown , the indices had surged more than 50 percent from the beginning of 1997 . 
but analysts said they expected sentiment to pick up later in June in the run-up to the reversion of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 . 
Guangdong Province expressway Co Ltd was the sharpest loser , falling 0.62 or 8.16 percent to HK $ 6.98 .
