Jakarta shares are expected to open higher on Tuesday , with the market focus remaining on newly-listed Bank Negara Indonesia ( BNI ) , brokers said . 
brokers said strong sentiment towards BNI had lend a positive tone to the overall market and many investors are likely to use the momentum to actively buy other counters , including banking and fundamentally-sound stocks . 
timber firm Barito Pacific , seasoning producer Miwon Indonesia and car maker Astra International are likely to continue drawing investors , but their upside level could be limited due to recent sharp gains , brokers said . 
on Monday , the successful listing of Bank Negara Indonesia coupled with active buying of some blue-chip counters helped sent the Jakarta composite index up 2.51 percent , or 15.38 points , to close at 628.24 points .
