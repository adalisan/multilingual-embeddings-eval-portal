a French tabby cat survived for a month trapped in the rubble of a building demolished by an explosion in the Mediterranean port of Marseille , drinking only rainwater , a vet said on Friday . 
the female cat , aged about 10 , was extremely weak . 
&quot; cats have a great capacity for survival , &quot; vet Sophie Boudon told France 3 television . 
the cat , one of its back legs bandaged , lay on the table beside her . 
the cat , trapped when a gas leak destroyed a block of flats on July 20 in Marseille , was uncovered this week . 
it survived only on rainwater trickling through the wreckage .
