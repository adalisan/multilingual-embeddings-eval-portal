President Boris Yeltsin , who has been on vacation since Monday , is taking decisions in key matters of foreign and domestic policy , spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing on Wednesday . 
&quot; Even on holiday , Boris Nikolayevich ( Yeltsin ) remains an active president . 
there should be no doubt that decisions on key issues of internal and foreign policy are being taken by him , &quot; Yastrzhembsky said . 
but Yastrzhembsky dodged a question about whether he had met the president in person since he left for his vacation , saying only that Yeltsin had spoken twice to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , once on August 26 and once on August 28 . 
&quot; These were long enough , substantial , constructive conversations , &quot; he said . 
he said Yeltsin was studying documents presented by his security chief Alexander Lebed on how to resolve the conflict in breakaway Chechnya and planned to make his orders on Lebed &apos;s responsibilities more concrete . 
but he added : &quot; To our great regret the Chechen problem is not one which can be resolved in one hour . 
the president has needed additional expert advice . 
he had no information about whether any meetings were planned between Yeltsin and Lebed , who returned to Moscow at the weekend saying he wanted Yeltsin &apos;s approval for his peace plan . 
Yeltsin , 65 , has been seen rarely in public since his reelection in July , prompting widespread speculation about his health . 
the Kremlin , which has repeatedly denied rumours that Yeltsin is ill , said he had started a holiday on Monday in the private Rus hunting lodge , some 100 km ( 60 miles ) from Moscow .
