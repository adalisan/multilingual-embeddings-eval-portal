Thai stocks are seen easing on on Tuesday on concerns surrounding the asset quality of finance firms , and jitters ahead of a parliamentary budget debate and a release of key economic data on Thursday , analysts said . 
the market ended a two day rally on Tuesday with the SET Index falling 11.40 points or 2.26 percent to 493.13 . 
the SET 50 dipped 0.96 points or 2.68 percent to 34.92 in trade worth 5.12 billion baht . 
I think people are concerned mostly about liquidity of finance firms , &quot; said an analyst at Chao Phaya Finance and Securities . 
finance stocks led the decline on Tuesday on concerns over tight liquidity and weak asset quality after a senior finance executive &apos;s estimate on Monday that up to 31.5 percent of total finance firm loans could be classified as non-performing . 
government measures announced on Tuesday to support the sector are welcome but unlikely to significantly move the market since they would have little immediate impact , analysts said . 
&quot; I think the government measures will help financial institutions in practice but not so much affect the market today because they will take some time to implement , &quot; the analyst said . 
risk averse investors will also be tempted to continue to take profits as uncertainty surrounds a budget submission to parliament in which the government is likely to have to explain the first fiscal deficit for nine years , analysts said . 
further nerves surround a release of economic data due for release on Thursday with investors focused on declining foreign reserve figures , analysts said .
