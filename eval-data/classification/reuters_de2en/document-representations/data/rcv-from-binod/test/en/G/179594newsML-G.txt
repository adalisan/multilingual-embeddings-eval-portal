the Czech Republic votes on November 15 and 16 to elect for the first time a 81-member upper house of parliament , the Senate . 
a second round run-off will be held on November 22 and 23 in constituencies where no candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote . 
this will be between the top two candidates from the first round . 
the first official preliminary results from the first round are expected on Saturday , November 16 in the evening , and for the second round on November 23 . 
the final official results are expected on November 18 for the first round , and November 25 , respectively . 
what follows are some key facts and figures : 
the Senate poll is the first electoral test for the three-party centre-right coalition which fell two seats short of a majority in the 200-seat lower house in June elections due to a strong showing by the centre-left Social Democrats . 
in all , candidates representing 29 political parties and movements will run in the Senate election . 
senators are elected in first-past-the-post votes in geographical constituencies unlike the lower house which is elected under a nationwide system of proportional representation . 
-- About 7.5 million Czechs aged 18 or over are eligible to vote in the election to the upper house , the members of which are elected for a six-year term . 
any Czech citizen aged over 40 can be elected . 
the Senate joins the lower-house , the Chamber of Deputies , to complete the two-chamber parliament established in the new constitution of the Czech Republic following the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993 . 
the constitution sets up the Senate as more of an advisory body with most of the legislative power vested in the lower house . 
if the upper house rejects measures already passed by the lower house , this rejection can be overridden by a majority of total seats in the lower house . 
the ruling coalition consists of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus &apos;s Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) , the Civic Democratic Alliance ( ODA ) led by vice-premier and Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda , and the Christian Democratic Union ( KDU-CSL ) led by agriculture minister and vice-premier Josef Lux . 
the Social Democrats ( CSSD ) of economist Milos Zeman form the largest opposition party in the lower house , with two extreme praties -- the Communists ( KSCM ) and the far-right Republicans ( SPR-RSC ) comprising the rest . 
the constituencies have approximately the same nubmer of citizens . 
the average number of citizens per seat is 127,000 . 
there is a + / - 15 percent fluctuation ragne within this limit . 
a candidate can win a seat in the first round by taking over 50 percent of the votes in the constituency . 
if nobody gets over 50 percent , the regional election committee calls a second round in the counstituency as a run-off between the two top vote winners in the first round . 
times are the same for the runoff the following Friday and Saturday . 
the official election campaign starts on Wednesday , October 30 and finishes on Wednesday November 13 , although many candidates have already launched their publicity . 
the official count begins when polling stations close on each Saturday and local media are planning to run exit polls soon after the voting is finished . 
preliminary official results will be released starting each Satuday evening . 
definitive results with allocation of seats are expected after the second round finishes , not before November 23 .
