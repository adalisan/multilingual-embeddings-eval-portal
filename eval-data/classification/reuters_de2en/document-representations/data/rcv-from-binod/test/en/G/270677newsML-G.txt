Egyptian youngsters have found an ingenious way to win a place in university despite low grades -- pretending they are blind . 
Abdelwahhab Abdelhafez , president of Ain shams university in Cairo , said in an interview published on Friday that out of 90 students enrolled this year under the special scheme for the blind , 25 turned out to be frauds . 
&quot; precise visual devices proved they were pretending . 
the centres from which they came will be investigated , &quot; he told the government newspaper al-Ahram . 
in one faculty , for example , an average of 50 percent in secondary school exams ensured a university place for the blind and other handicapped people . 
other students needed an average of at least 85 percent , he said .
