KCBT hard red winter wheat futures up settled but well below session highs as short covering dried up , traders said . 
KCBT wheat had been broadly higher at the midsession on commission-house short covering and on added support from rain-related harvest delays in central Texas . 
&quot; Our shortcovering evaporated toward the close , &quot; a trader said . 
late weakness appeared as commission house Refco , which had bought 1.5 million July bushels earlier in the session , turned around and sold at least one million July . 
traders said the market softened further as Benson-Quinn sold 450,000 July bushels on the close . 
futures settled 1 / 2 to four cents higher , with July up 1 / 2 cent at $ 3.83-1 / 2 per bushel . 
earlier , July had been up as much as six cents at $ 3.89 . 
other featured sellers included prudential Securities and LFG , which each sold at least one million July bushels .
