&quot; The peso closed firmer on momentum carried over from Friday , &quot; a trader said .

same-day peso contracts had earlier closed four centavos firmer at 7.9600 / 7.9650 per dollar . 
dealers forecast an increase of 50-75 basis points on primary Cetes rates at the central bank auction to be held on Tuesday .

traders said stable U.S. long bond yields and a buoyant bourse also helped bolster the peso . 
yields on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond stood at 6.83 percent , marginally up from 6.81 percent in late trade on Friday . 
the IPC index of leading Mexican stocks was up 0.46 percent at 3,827.35 points when the foreign exchange market closed .
