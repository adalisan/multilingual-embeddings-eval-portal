&quot; It was pretty quiet all session . 
we basically followed Kansas City . 
there was some light commercial buying early in the day but it was never anything heavy-duty , &quot; a trader said . 
MGE spring wheat settled unchanged to four cents higher , with July up four cents at $ 4.15-1 / 4 per bushel . 
New-crop September settled up 2-3 / 4 cents at $ 4.12-1 / 2 .
