the world &apos;s top financial officials met in Washington on Saturday against a backdrop of stable economic expansion and amid a growing consensus on how to help the poorest nations and handle financial crises . 
with growth in the Group of Seven rich nations set to rise to 2.5 percent in 1997 after 2.2 percent in 1996 , little sign of inflation , and renewed calm on currency markets , the economic part of the leaders &apos; agenda looked uneventful . 
&quot; The economic situation will be the focus of our talks this morning , &quot; German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in Washington ahead of the meeting with officials from Britain , Canada , France , Italy , Japan and the United States . 
&quot; We can draw a favourable conclusion , &quot; he added . 
&quot; The outlook has improved world-wide . 
the upturn in the United States is continuing and in Japan there are growing signs of a recovery . 
in Europe it is more varied -- but in Germany the pause in growth is over and the upturn has begun . 
Waigel &apos;s view was echoed by a senior Canadian official , who said , &quot; The recovery is broadening and deepening throughout the world . 
it &apos;s the best prospects we &apos;ve seen for some time . 
reflecting the greater optimism for growth expressed in an annual economic report released a few days ahead of the meeting , the official added , &quot; In Japan and Europe , things are stronger than they were last spring . 
currency markets , now recovered from the dollar &apos;s plunge to record lows 18 months ago , were seen playing at best a secondary role in the talks . 
worries about those exchange market tensions had been replaced by growing interest from the United States and Japan in Europe &apos;s plans to create a single currency , officials said . 
with the economic discussions freed from the acrimonious back-biting which has sometimes characterised talks in the past , the focus in advance of the meeting had switched to a second agenda item : how to fund aid to the poorest nations . 
the G7 hope to agree on a plan to reduce the debt burden on a small group of nations by offering direct debt forgiveness and low-interest loans , tied in to economic reform programmes . 
their consensus position can then be presented to the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank next week . 
the IMF also wants to step up its available funding in case of emergencies by doubling a crisis lending fund , the General Arrangements to borrow , to around $ 50 billion , by adding new contributors and setting up a parallel facility . 
plans to make a new issue of the IMF &apos;s own currency , the Special Drawing Right , to offer to 38 member nations which have joined since the last issue was made , were also on the agenda , although no decision was expected yet . 
looking further ahead , the meetings will also examine the need for an increase in IMF quotas -- the Fund &apos;s share capital -- to make sure it has cash for its daily running needs . 
on aid for poor nations , urgent talks last week failed to swing a blocking minority of nations adamantly opposed to the sale of a small amount of IMF gold around to the majority view that this would be a good way to fund additional aid . 
Germany , the ringleader of those opposed to the plan , made clear that it was not about to drop its objections . 
taking the view that all parties knew each other &apos;s stance , Waigel said , &quot; Germany continues to oppose gold sales . 
but with the issue seemingly deadlocked for now , officials were expected simply to endorse a statement from the IMF board saying that continued funding for its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility ( ESAF ) would be assured . 
the issue of gold sales would likely be shelved until later , officials said . 
Philippe Maystadt , Belgium &apos;s Finance Minister and the chairman of the IMF &apos;s Interim Committee , told reporters , &quot; If my colleagues at the interim committee confirm the understanding reached at the IMF board that is sufficient for me and we can launch the initiative . 
but the G7 looked set to make progress on at least one key area of aid to poverty-stricken countries in today &apos;s talks . 
the senior Canadian official said the G7 , which controls a large part of the world &apos;s debt , would agree more generous forgiveness terms for nations sinking under their debt burden . 
he told reporters the G7 would unite behind a proposal that the ceiling for debt controlled by the so-called Paris Club should be raised to 80 percent from 67 percent currently to meet genuine cases of economic need .
