gold prices run the risk of further losses on Monday after sinking to the lowest level in more than four years last week , dealers said . 
silver is following gold , which may target as low as $ 325 an ounce , but platinum group metals ( PGMs ) markets are still tight . 
gold - Prices were threatening to dip even lower after crumbling late last week , but might have a near-term reprieve as cheaper gold was snapped up , European dealers said . 
&quot; So far Europe has been pretty quiet , which is helped by the fact that Hong Kong is closed today , &quot; one said . 
buyers would be seeking bargains at the bottom of the market , so gold might be supported in the near term . 
&quot; But the trend is still lower , &quot; he added . 
gold might pause at $ 330 but the eventual downside target was $ 325 , the low from March 1993 , dealers said . 
prices slumped to their lowest in nearly 4-1 / 4 years on Friday , under pressure from a stronger dollar and from short selling by market professionals . 
&quot; Once it loses a dollar or two , it could lose ground very rapidly to $ 325 , &quot; a dealer said . 
at 0730 GMT spot gold was indicated at $ 334.35 / $ 334.85 an ounce , compared to $ 336.90 / $ 337.40 at Friday &apos;s London close . 
silver - The market would probably follow if gold fell further , dealers said . 
but support was expected at the low of $ 4.60 touched on May 20 , which had followed a dip to $ 4.59 on April 28 . 
silver was indicated at $ 4.69 / $ 4.71 an ounce at 0730 GMT , down four cents from Friday &apos;s London finish . 
platinum - platinum and palladium markets remained tight in the absence of long-delayed Russian exports and so were unmoved by gold &apos;s weakness for the time being , dealers said . 
platinum prices were last quoted at $ 419.00 / $ 422.00 , versus $ 416.00 / $ 421.00 on Friday . 
but palladium was off $ 4.00 at $ 188.00 / $ 191.00 .
