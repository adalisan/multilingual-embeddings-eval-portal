embattled Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan faced a fresh challenge in parliament on Wednesday as armed soldiers and protesters blockaded the building . 
opposition leaders who failed on Tuesday to push through a parliamentary motion calling on Chan and two senior ministers to quit were pushing for another vote later on Wednesday . 
the motion would not be binding on Chan because elections are due in three months , but it would increase pressure for him to quit over a failed plan to use mercenaries against rebels on Bougainville island . 
&quot; He cannot escape , &quot; Port Moresby governor Bill skate told Reuters . 
&quot; We will hound him until he resigns -- we &apos;re not going anywhere and those people out there will not go away until he quits . 
the motion , slightly stronger than Tuesday &apos;s , called for Chan , Deputy Prime Minister Chris Haiveta and Defence Minister Mathias Ijape to resign &quot; to defuse the situation and so allow parliament and the people to return to normality &quot; . 
Chan was nowhere to be seen . 
the embattled prime minister slipped out of parliament after Tuesday &apos;s vote although officials said he would return . 
as PNG &apos;s 10-day crisis -- which has preoccupied its South Pacific neighbours -- intensified , Governor-General Sir Wiwa Korowi appealed for soldiers to return to barracks . 
&quot; Let us not take to the streets to destroy the nation , &quot; Korowi said in a national radio address . 
about 80 heavily armed soldiers and thousands of anti-government protestors beseiged the parliament building overnight , preventing politicans from leaving . 
by noon on Wednesday around 30 soldiers remained with some 2,000 protesters chanting &quot; resign Chan , resign &quot; . 
shops , banks and other businesses which were closed on Tuesday amid the political upheaval were reopening on Wednesday and public transport was returning to normal . 
Korowi , who as the official representative of titular head of state Queen Elizabeth wields considerable influence , has already called on Chan to step aside . 
in his national address , he said he understood that many people felt frustrated and wanted to take to the streets to burn cars , damage property and fight but the cost was too high . 
&quot; No matter what amount of evil we think they have committed , your confrontation directly with the parliament and its members will not help and I appeal to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force as your commander-in-chief to move back to barracks this morning , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What you have done overnight by holding the members of parliament under siege is dangerous , now get back to your barracks , &quot; he said . 
Korowi also appealed for sacked army commander , Jerry Singirok , to hand over control of the defence force to the new commander , Colonel Jack Tuat . 
he called on Singirok to &quot; hand over graciously command of the defence forces &quot; . 
Singirok was dismissed last week after turning on Chan and demanding his resignation of the $ 36 million mercenary contract with Sandline International . 
the contract fell apart amid violent street protests and the mercenaries , except for their British commander , were expelled . 
Singirok told Australian radio he did not take responsiblity for soldiers joining the protest and said troops had only been at parliament to assist police . 
&quot; The demonstration that you have seen outside the parliament is the people &apos;s voice , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Politicians must now understand the reality : the people have the power .
