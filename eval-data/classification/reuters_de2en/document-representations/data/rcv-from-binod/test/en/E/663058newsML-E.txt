Zimbabwe &apos;s annual inflation is likely to hover above 20 percent in the quarter to September , driven largely by high money supply growth and an expected rise in taxes and fuel prices , economic analysts said on Monday . 
they told Reuters that a slip in the country &apos;s year-on-year consumer price index to 20.7 percent in May from 22.4 percent in April was probably temporary and was mostly due to a drop in food prices . 
&quot; It &apos;s a part correction of what pushed it ( inflation ) up last month ( April ) when there was a 25 percent rise in fruit and vegetable prices . 
this time those prices have come down by half of that and due to the food weighting inflation is lower , &quot; said John Robertson , a private economic consultant . 
&quot; It &apos;s probably going to be temporary , &quot; he said adding : &quot; I guess inflation is still going to be higher in June and I can see it still hovering above 20 percent , possibly rising to between 22 and 23 percent ( in the quarter to September ) , &quot; he said . 
Robertson said although it was likely that food prices would come down further in June , their effect were likely to be outweighed by a recent spate of petrol price and school fees hikes which he said had yet to register in the inflation basket . 
he and Anthony Hawkins , an economics lecturer at Harare &apos;s Univeristy of Zimbabwe , said they expected additional inflationary pressure to come from higher taxes , cigarette and alcohol prices expected in the national budget scheduled for July 27 . 
&quot; The underlying trend is upwards if you look at the frightening money supply figures , &quot; Hawkins said . 
Zimbabwe &apos;s broadly-defined yearly money supply growth is currently pegged at 33.8 percent . 
Hawkins said money supply growth was being driven largely by the government &apos;s budget deficit which is expected to widen to 11 percent of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) in the financial year ending June 30 , off a target of 8.9 percent of GDP .
