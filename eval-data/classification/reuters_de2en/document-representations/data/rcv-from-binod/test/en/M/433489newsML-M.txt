CME hog futures remained under pressure at the close from a combination of profit taking , fund selling and long liquidation prompted by further weakness in cash markets , traders said . 
pork bellies rallied to end higher on short covering and ideas cash product has bottomed , traders said . 
hogs closed 0.925 cent per lb lower to unchanged with April off most at 69.175 cents . 
pork bellies finished 1.150 to 0.050 higher with May up 0.625 at 76.500 cents . 
initial gains in hogs sparked by lower grain price expectations failed to hold and hog futures sank on concerns over a weak tone to pork products and cash hogs , traders said . 
floor traders also cited calls for $ 0.50 per cwt lower cash hog markets Wednesday . 
&quot; Product is still under pressure , &quot; said Julia Bussie , livestock analyst for AG Edwards . 
sell stops added to early losses and only light short covering lifted futures from day &apos;s lows late . 
mostly lower quotes for cash pork at noon and expectations for lower cash hog prices Wednesday weighed on futures , they said . 
futures had a premium built in , expecting higher cash prices by this time of year . 
but recent weak pork prices and only tepid packer demand for hogs kept cash markets pressured . 
&quot; I think the trade is getting suspect , as we are getting close here to April , that there &apos;s too much premium in there and maybe we got too much in June and July also , &quot; said Don Roose , President of U.S. commodities Inc . 
Cargill investor Services bought June . 
in hog options , there was general buying of April 74 and lower puts , pit sources said . 
pork bellies rallied again late on renewed short covering prompted by firmer cash ideas which offset the outlook for increased storings . 
USDA quoted cash bellies steady at noon and prices could be higher by Wednesday , traders said . 
&quot; We saw expanded interest from user types , &quot; said Chuck Levitt , senior livestock analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. 
technically the market also looked oversold after a nine- cent break last week . 
March fell to a major trend line on the charts Monday and held early despite heavy deliveries . 
those deliveries may have gone to strong hands , traders added . 
after the close , the CME reported a net in-movement at warehouses outside Chicago last week of 1.833 million lbs , above analyst and trader expectations of an in-movement of 1.0 million to 1.5 million lbs .
