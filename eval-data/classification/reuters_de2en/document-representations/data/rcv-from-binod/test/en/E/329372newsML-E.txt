the pace of recovery in Japan &apos;s industrial output will slow in the next business year as the government clamps down on fiscal spending , analysts predicted in a Reuters poll released on Thursday . 
the forecasts by economists at 32 institutions produced a mean average year-on-year rise of 2.1 percent in industrial output for fiscal 1997 / 98 , compared with their average forecast of a year-on-year rise of 3.3 percent for the current business year . 
industrial output jumped 4.0 percent year-on-year in November . 
the government will raise the sales tax from three to five percent in April as well as end special income tax cuts . 
public works spending , a major stimulant of the economy over the last two years , is also expected to be modest . 
the survey covered 37 brokerages and research bodies , although not all those polled responded to all the questions . 
the analysts were divided on the extent of the expected decline . 
at the more bearish end , several economists forecast a rise of less than one percent from the current business year . 
they said significant stock adjustment had taken place in only a few industries and others , such as the paper and pulp and chemical sectors , still lagged behind . 
Yasuhiko Ushikubo , an economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan , said much of the strength in 1996 / 97 output resulted from stepped up production to feed a consumer spending spree ahead of a planned sales tax increase . 
this would naturally peter out after the sales tax was raised in April , he said . 
&quot; Industrial output is only high now because of special factors ... 
if the peaks are high , then the forthcoming valleys are going to be low , &quot; said Ushikubo . 
the more bullish , however , said stock adjustment was progressing well , citing year-on-year declines in inventories in October and November . 
they added that export volume growth , particularly if the yen stayed weak , would help support manufacturing . 
the survey was conducted between January 13 and 16 .
