the dollar ended sharply higher against the Swiss franc and rose to its highest level in 31 months against the mark on Monday , after the Swiss finance minister said he was relieved with recent weakness in his country &apos;s currency . 
the dollar &apos;s impressive performance against European currencies helped it regain its footing against the yen . 
after retreating from a near four year high versus the Japanese currency on Friday , the dollar resumed its climb on Monday , once again nearing the key 120 level . 
&quot; The dollar has come back very well , &quot; said Russell LaScala , head of the spot trading desk at Citibank . 
&quot; People sold the Swiss franc on the comments out of Switzerland and the dollar was dragged higher against the mark as well . 
after reaching a peak of 1.6493 marks , its highest level since June of 1994 , the dollar ended the day at 1.6470 / 75 marks , up from 1.6365 / 75 at the open . 
the dollar surged to a close of 1.4300 / 05 Swiss francs against 1.4140 / 50 at the open . 
Swiss Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger told a wire service on Monday that he was &quot; relieved &quot; by the weak Swiss franc , prompting a flood of franc sales which boosted the dollar against a host of European currencies . 
dealers said the remarks were consistent with recent efforts on the part of the Swiss central bank to push the franc lower as a means of jump-starting the sluggish Swiss economy . 
the dollar &apos;s good tone against Europe , and in particular against the mark , was also helped by renewed fears about the health of Russian President Boris Yeltsin . 
on Monday , a Kremlin spokesman said doctors had advised the 65-year old leader , who is recovering from pneumonia and has not been seen in public for three weeks , not to leave Moscow . 
a scheduled trip to the Netherlands , where Yeltsin was to have met Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok on February 4 , was cancelled . 
against the yen , the dollar also performed well , but dealers were hesitant to push it too high , after talk last week that the Japanese central bank had been defending the yen near the 120 level . 
on Friday , the dollar reached 120.15 yen , its highest level in 47 months , before retreating on the rumors . 
the dollar ended trading on Monday at 119.55 / 60 yen , up from 119.24 / 29 at the open . 
&quot; Although everyone is bullish on the dollar I think it &apos;s harder to be as bullish on the dollar against the yen because of the psychological 120 level , &quot; said Lizbeth Goldberg , assistant vice president on the foreign exchange desk at Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechselbank in New York . 
&quot; As soon as we got to 120 last week there were all sorts of rumors about the Bank of Japan , &quot; she added . 
elsewhere , sterling ended unchanged against the dollar at $ 1.6215 / 25 . 
the greenback retreated modestly to close at Canadian $ 1.3437 / 42 against $ 1.3462 / 67 at the open . 
the Australian dollar ended at $ 0.7721 / 26 , up modestly from $ 0.7710 / 15 in early dealings .
