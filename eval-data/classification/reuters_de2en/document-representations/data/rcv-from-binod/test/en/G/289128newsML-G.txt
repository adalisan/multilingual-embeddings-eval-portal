a remote Scottish island celebrated Christmas on Monday , refusing to recognise the calendar adopted by the rest of Britain nearly 250 years ago . 
Foula , about 20 miles ( 30 km ) west of the Shetland Isles &apos; main island , is the only place in western Europe still relying on the calendar formulated by Roman emperor Julius Caesar . 
errors in the Julian calendar led to the introduction of a new calendar by Pope Gregory in the late 16th century . 
acceptance of this Gregorian calendar spread throughout western Europe and it was eventually adopted by Britain in 1752 . 
but not by Foula and its population of 75 . 
there , it &apos;s still December 25 .
