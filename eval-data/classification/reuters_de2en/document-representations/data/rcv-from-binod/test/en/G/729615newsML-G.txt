the woman who completed the around-the-world flight attempted by legendary aviator Amelia Earhart was sued Monday over allegations that neglect at one of her Texas nursing homes contributed to the death of a elderly resident . 
Linda Finch , 46 , was sued after the Texas Department of Public Health concluded workers at her Austin nursing home failed to monitor blood sugar levels of a diabetic resident with a urinary tract infection who died in February . 
the suit , filed by Texas Attorney General Dan Morales , also alleged Finch &apos;s Pecan Grove Care Centre in Austin failed to meet minimum licensing standards in a February inspection . 
Finch defended care provided to the resident , who had been admitted a month before he died , and said her four Texas nursing homes have routinely met state standards . 
&quot; It &apos;s the same lawsuit that ( Morales ) threatened to file when I got home , but he didn &apos;t file it , &quot; Finch said . 
&quot; If my care in a community of 2,000 was so bad , would they be giving me a parade , &quot; she asked of an August celebration in Stephenville , about 50 miles ( 80 kms ) southwest of Fort worth , where allegations of neglect led to an earlier lawsuit . 
Finch in May completed an around-the-world flight Earhart was attempting 60 years ago when she and a navigator disappeared near Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean .
