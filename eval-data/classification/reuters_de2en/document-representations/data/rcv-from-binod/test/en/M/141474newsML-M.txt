the Italian lira sagged on Thursday after the Italian government &apos;s surprise cut in its key discount rate on Wednesday to 7.5 from 8.25 percent . 
analysts had thought the central bank would wait to cut its borrowing rates until after Italy &apos;s deficit-cutting 1997 budget had passed the initial test in parliament in mid-November . 
&quot; The timing of the cut was sooner than expected , &quot; said Sharde Persaud , economist at San Paolo Bank . 
Persaud said the sudden cut had dented sentiment , but much of the Italian currency &apos;s weakness was due to the advance of the mighty German mark on fading expectations of further German rate cuts . 
the lira dipped against the mark overnight to a low of 1007.10 lire against 1002.90 / 3.20 in late Europe on Wednesday but recovered to 1005.80 / 6.05 at 0855 GMT . 
long-term , however , the move is seen as constructive and follows preliminary data pointing to October inflation of 3.0 percent year-on-year after 3.4 percent in September and improving sentiment regarding the 1997 budget plans . 
&quot; This will all help the Italian economy , &quot; said one trader . 
improved sentiment about the 1997 budget followed an apparent deal on Wednesday night by the governing coalition on controversial plans to reform the income tax system . 
initial opposition to the plans had raised uncertainty about the passage of Prime Minister Romano Prodi &apos;s 1997 budget , which aims to slash the public sector deficit by 62.5 trillion lire ( $ 42 billion ) . 
despite the short-term dent in the lira , analysts said the rate cut should help revive the economy in the longer term and ease the bloated public sector debt . 
Italian gross domestic product ( GDP ) , for instance , grew by 0.7 percent year-on-year in second quarter 1996 but fell 0.4 percent from the first quarter . 
&quot; Growth is still very sluggish , there is very low consumer confidence , &quot; Persaud said . 
Prodi was quick to endorse the rate cut on Wednesday . 
&quot; It &apos;s a recognition of the validity of the work carried out by the government and a useful encouragement for the path that we still have to pursue , &quot; he said . 
Prodi is keen to bring the economy back into step and reduce public spending to prepare the country for its re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism and , he hopes , for membership of the European single currency by 1999 . 
aside from the lira , the mark was generally firmer against other European currencies on Thursday , gathering pace against the dollar and yen with the help of remarks by senior Bundesbank officials which apparently ruled out German interest rate cuts . 
Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing on Wednesday said key German interest rates were at historic lows and nothing more should be expected or is necessary . 
Bundesbank vice president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum also on Wednesday said current interest rate levels were correct and the central bank wanted to keep rates steady for as long as possible . 
&quot; The Bundesbank has led us up blind alleys before but I really don &apos;t think there &apos;s much chance of a rate move after those comments , &quot; said Peter Wood , trader at Bank of Boston .
