Singapore shares crept up on low volumes on Friday with dealers in search of something to kick start the market and lift activity ahead of the new year . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing to kick the market ; people are not inclined to invest , &quot; one dealer said . 
just 34.9 million shares were moved in dull post-Christmas , pre-weekend trade , but it was enough to see the key Straits Times Industrials Index end up 4.91 points at 2,202.60 . 
other indices , the UOB over-the-counter index and the Business Times-Singapore Regional Index also nudged higher , up 1.20 at 1,196.35 and 1.38 at 1,093.10 respectively . 
dealers said a lack of liquidity in the market had combined with an extended festive period to restrain trade . 
&quot; People have taken a very long break . 
some fund managers are around but they &apos;re not inclined to make any big bets , &quot; a dealer said . 
overall , gainers outstripped losers 195 to 98 .
