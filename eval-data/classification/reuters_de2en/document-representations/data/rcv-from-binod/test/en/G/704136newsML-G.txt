new York , July 2 ( Reuter - Around-the-clock negotiations paid off for the New York Knicks and Patrick Ewing when the 11-time NBA All-Star centre signed a four-year contract worth more than $ 60 million Wednesday , one day after he became a free agent . 
&quot; We have unfinished business , &quot; said Ewing , who in his 12 seasons with New York is still seeking an NBA title . 
&quot; Now I look forward to bringing the team and the fans the championship they deserve . 
Ewing , who will turn 35 on August 5 , became eligible for free agency Tuesday , but the Knicks -- who under salary cap rules could exceed any offer by another team -- moved swiftly to re-sign him . 
Ewing &apos;s agent , David Faulk , also wanted to clear up his business with the Knicks quickly and then move on to another client -- Michael Jordan , also a free agent who has yet to re-sign with the NBA champion Chicago bulls . 
&quot; Michael and Patrick rank number one and two in the NBA , &quot; Faulk said . 
&quot; Ewing never wanted to entertain any other offers , he just wanted market value for a centre of his calibre . 
he wanted to stay here in New York . 
Ewing &apos;s $ 15 million-plus annual aveage salary -- Faulk would not divulge details but said the four-year package was worth more than $ 60 million -- would put him in line with fellow All-Star centres Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson . 
Ewing was selected first overall by the Knicks in the 1985 draft -- the first lottery pick ever . 
&quot; Knowing that I will be able to stay in New York means a lot to me , &quot; said Ewing . 
&quot; I have had some great times over the last 12 years in a Knicks uniform , and now I look forward to many more great years ahead . 
&quot; This is a man who keeps in great shape , &quot; said Madison Square Garden president and chief executive officer , Dave Checketts . 
&quot; He very much intends to play beyond his contract . 
and Madison Square Garden will be happy to tender him still another contract . 
&quot; Patrick is a good human being , he is loyal to New York and our fans , &quot; said general manager Ernie Grunfeld . 
&quot; In this day it is very unusual for a player to play his entire career with one team , especially a player of Patrick &apos;s ability . 
&quot; He wanted to be here and we want him here as the foundation of our team . 
in the last 18 months we have made changes and rebuilt our team , but because of Ewing we have kept on winning . 
&quot; Ernie and Dave have made changes and brought in some great players to build around me , &quot; said Ewing . 
&quot; We didn &apos;t get it done last year , but we will learn from that and try again . 
last year ended on a bad note and we want to rectify that . 
this past season -- despite the expensive additions of forward Larry Johnson guards Allen Houston and Chris Childs -- the Knicks lost to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference semifinals under circumstances that led Ewing to say he felt as if he had been robbed . 
he was suspended for Game 6 of the series for leaving the bench area during a fight in Game 5 and the Knicks , who had been up 3-1 , lost the series in seven games . 
Ewing &apos;s Knicks came closest to a title in 1994 when they lost in the NBA finals to the Houston rockets in seven games . 
Ewing , who will become the first player ever to play 13 seasons in a Knicks uniform ( passing Carl Braun ) , is the team &apos;s all-time career leader in games ( 913 ) , minutes ( 33,403 ) , rebounds ( 9,513 ) , steals ( 979 ) , blocks ( 2,516 ) and points ( 21,539 ) , and is third in scoring average . 
on the NBA career lists he is 19th in scoring with 21,539 points and fifth in blocks with 2,516 . 
he has a career average of 23.6 points per game , 10.4 rebounds per game , and .513 shooting percentage . 
he was named one of the league &apos;s 50 greatest players of its first 50 years .
