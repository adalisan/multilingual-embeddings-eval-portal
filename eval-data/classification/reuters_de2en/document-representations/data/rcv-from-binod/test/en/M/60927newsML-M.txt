Zimbabwean stocks reversed their upward march on Wednesday as the market corrected after its recent heady gains . 
but brokers said the move lower was expected to be temporary as investor sentiment was still high on expectations of lending rate cuts following a dramatic fall in annual inflation . 
data released on Monday showed Zimbabwean inflation rose just 0.02 percent in August from July and 17.7 percent year-on-year . 
the key industrial index , which has soared 80.7 percent over the past nine months , dropped 39.26 points to close at 7,137.29 after a day of mixed and active trade . 
&quot; We were expecting some profit-taking but the question was when . 
so today was a departure from the trend but the market will pick up again . 
this should be a mere correction with prices having risen so much as to induce people to sell , &quot; one broker said . 
Food-canning firm Cairns lost 15 cents to 800 , while hotel chain Zimsun at 425 and packaging group Hunyani at 390 were both 10 cents lower . 
merchant bankers FMB slid 100 cents to 3,400 and multi-industrial group mash and pork processor Colcom each dropped 25 cents to 125 and 340 respectively . 
bankers Barclays and blue-chip conglomerate Delta traded at overnight levels in reasonable turnover but against the trend . 
against the trend , finance house Finhold rose 100 cents to 900 , food group Natfoods and pottery-maker Ariston each rose 50 cents to 650 and 1,350 respectively . 
soft drinks manufacturer Schweppes gained 35 cents to 660 , while multi-industrial group Tedco at 470 , sugar producer Hippo at 860 and pharmaceutical firm caps at 250 all put on 10 cents . 
Minings were also active although weaker with gold producer Ashanti sliding 500 cents to 15,500 , Rio tinto dropping 200 cents to 3,300 , Falgold down 20 cents to 180 and Wankie colliery slipping five cents off to 350 . 
falcon was the only winner , rising 50 cents to 1,800 . 
the mining index ended 42.35 points down at 1,373.97 .
