Qatari and Japanese executives began talks on Sunday to fix a price for the sale and purchase of liquefied natural gas in the next quarter , officials said . 
Qatar began supplying LNG to Chubu Electric Power Co of Japan in January . 
but under the terms of the sales-and-purchase agreement ( SPA ) valid for 25 years , pricing has been left to periodical reviews linked to quarterly fluctuations in crude oil prices . 
&quot; In January we had agreed to an interim price of $ 4.10 per million BTU for three months to March 31 . 
now , it is time to review and fix a new price for another three months , &quot; said an official at the state &apos;s Qatar General Petroleum Corp. 
QGPC owns 65 percent of Qatar liquefied Gas Co ( Qatargas ) , which signed the SPA to supply four million tonnes a year of LNG to Chubu from January 1997 and two million tonnes a year to seven other Japanese utilities from mid-1998 for 25 years . 
others partners of Qatargas are the U.S. Mobil Corp and France &apos;s Total , which have a 10 percent stake each , and Japan &apos;s Mitsui and Marubeni , which hold 7.5 percent each . 
executives taking part in the talks represent all Qatargas shareholders and Chubu . 
the price to be fixed will be C.I.F. 
( cargo including freight ) , meaning transport cost is included .
