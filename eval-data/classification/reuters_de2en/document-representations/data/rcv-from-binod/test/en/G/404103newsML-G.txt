stinging from back-to-back drug corruption scandals at the highest levels of its government , Mexico vowed on Tuesday to overhaul and clean up its corrupted police agencies in charge of the drug war . 
Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said Mexico &apos;s justice system faced its worst crisis in modern times , and pledged &quot; a radical overhaul &quot; of his agency and others entrusted with fighting the multi-billion dollar illegal drug trade . 
&quot; It is clear the attorney general &apos;s office has been suffering for some time with serious problems ... of corruption , inefficiency and obsolescence , &quot; Madrazo told a news conference . 
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo ordered the reforms following the spectacular arrest earlier this month of the country &apos;s anti-drugs Czar , Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo , on charges he had links to a drug kingpin . 
allegations by the New York Times that two acting Mexican governors have ties to drug barons also roiled the country this week , creating the impression among ordinary Mexicans that much of their government is tainted by drug corruption . 
Madrazo announced no new firings on Tuesday after dismissing 36 antinarcotics agents on Monday . 
but officials in western Jalisco state said on Tuesday they had fired some 300 police agents that had worked under army Capt. 
Horacio Montenegro Ortiz , a former chief of state police and a close aide to Gutierrez who was jailed along with the disgraced general . 
&quot; I don &apos;t want any police agents who worked with those two men , &quot; Gov. 
Alberto Cardenas , of the opposition National Action Party , told reporters . 
as part of the planned reforms , Madrazo said he would impose stricter rules governing hiring and training of police agents , and also give them high enough wages to help resist corruption . 
and north of the U.S.-Mexico border , pressure has mounted on U.S. President Bill Clinton to deny Mexico a passing grade in Washington &apos;s annual &quot; certification &quot; of countries &apos; efforts to stop drugs . 
Decertified countries face U.S. sanctions . 
Mexico , the third largest U.S. trading partner , is the main conduit for illegal cocaine and marijuana into the United States from South America and has in recent years become a breeding ground for powerful cartels . 
Madrazo echoed other Mexican officials &apos; anger at the certification process on Tuesday by saying it was a unilateral act by the United States that did not help Mexico &apos;s efforts to stem the flow of drugs to U.S. territory . 
Madrazo took over from former attorney general Antonio Lozano a few months ago . 
Mexico &apos;s top cops have lasted on average just one year in recent years due to persistent corruption scandals . 
each incoming attorney general has promised to root out corruption .
