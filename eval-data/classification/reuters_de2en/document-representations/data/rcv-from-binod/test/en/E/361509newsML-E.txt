the adjusted annual rate of growth of Irish private sector credit fell to 14.9 percent in December from a revised 16.5 percent in November , central bank monthly statistics showed on Thursday . 
market forecasts had been for a rise of 15 to 17 percent . 
the increase in private sector credit in December was reduced as a consequence of the securitisation of 200 million Irish pounds of mortgages , the bank said in a statement . 
this contributed to a fall in the total amount of residential mortage lending and caused the annual growth rate in this category to fall to 14.7 percent from 17.1 percent in the previous two months . 
if the securitisation had not occurred , the annual rate of increase in mortgage lending would have been around 16.8 percent and the underlying annual rate of credit growth would have slowed to around 15.7 percent in December , the bank said . 
the annual rate of increase in non-mortgage Irish pound credit , which was not affected by the securitisation , slowed to 16.5 percent in December from 17.5 percent the previous month . 
as a result of the ending of the payment of value-added-tax at the point of entry , payments amounting to 119 million Irish pounds which would have been due in December were deferred to January . 
as a result , private sector credit in December was lower and current and deposit account balances higher than they would otherwise have been . 
the adjusted rate of growth of M3E , the broad money supply measure , rose to 15.7 percent at end-December from 13.6 percent . 
this represented an increase of 3.8 percent or 1.277 billion in December but adjusted for changes in deposits at Dublin &apos;s International Financial Services Centre ( IFSC ) , the increase was 4.5 percent . 
the increase in private sector credit was 648 million Irish pounds or 1.9 percent in December . 
of this increase , 539 million was foreign currency-denominated but 460 million of this was due to lending to non-bank IFSC companies . 
the rate of credit growth in December was slowed by a fall of 26 million in residential mortgage lending . 
adjusting for the effect of the securitisation of existing mortgages , the underlying increase in mortgage lending was 174 million of which around one fifth was due to end-quarter postings of interest . 
lending to the Agricultural Intervention Agency rose by 69 million , virtually the same as in December 1995 , the bank said .
