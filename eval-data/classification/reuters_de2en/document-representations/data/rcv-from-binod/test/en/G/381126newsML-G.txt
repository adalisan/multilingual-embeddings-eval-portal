a dispute over who should control the pivotal river port town of Brcko still casts a shadow over the process of building peace in Bosnia after three years of war . 
a U.S. arbiter concluded it was better to avoid a clear resolution of the issue for another year than risk reigniting a war over who should control the northern town . 
Washington &apos;s envoy to the Balkans , John Kornblum , called the arbiter &apos;s ruling on Friday &quot; definitely enough &quot; to prevent renewed fighting between Bosnian Serb and Moslem forces . 
it allows Bosnian Serbs , a pre-war minority in Brcko , to remain in control until 1998 when the issue will be revisited . 
returning Brcko to Moslem-Croat control would have isolated the Bosnian Serb pocket in northwest Bosnia , including the industrial town of Banja Luka , from the bulk of Bosnian Serb territory in the east . 
in the meantime , an &quot; international supervisor &quot; is supposed to oversee the return of Moslem and Croat refugees to their Brcko homes and promote economic reconstruction . 
but the ruling gave no clear executive authority to the supervisor and did not set out a mechanism to punish either faction for violating the arbiter &apos;s decision . 
Carl Bildt , the international High Representative to Bosnia , whose office will appoint the supervisor for Brcko , warned reporters over the weekend that there were &quot; no guarantees &quot; that Serb authorities would comply . 
&quot; It is sometimes easier to write a thing in a Washington law firm than to do it on the ground in Brcko , &quot; he said . 
Bosnian Moslem leaders and political analysts say the key to defusing tensions over Brcko is to allow refugees expelled from the town early in the 1992-95 war to return . 
but ultra-nationalist Serb authorities have repeatedly refused to allow Moslem or Croat refugees to move back to territory which now lies inside Bosnia &apos;s Serb entity . 
in a year from now , the United States and European powers could be facing the same conundrum over Brcko , possibly aggravated by a local election . 
as Bosnian Moslems rebuild their army with the help of a U.S.-sponsored military aid programme , Serb authorities are ironically counting on the long-term deployment of NATO troops to prevent any possible Moslem offensive . 
Bosnian Serb leaders once had their army fire on and capture soldiers in the U.N. peacekeeping force . 
now they are grateful for the presence of the NATO-led peace force , which has U.S. troops patrolling Brcko . 
but diplomats have already predicted NATO will stay in Bosnia beyond 1998 to maintain the peace and head off another influx of refugees heading to Western Europe . 
the Bosnian Serbs , who conquered Brcko in 1992 , say privately they are confident that the peacekeeping force will remain in Bosnia indefinitely . 
this place will become some sort of Cyprus , &quot; said one Serb official , who asked not to be named . 
analysts say the Bosnian Moslems are closing the military gap with the Serbs , who enjoyed a big advantage in heavy weaponry during the war . 
the International Crisis Group , a London-based private agency monitoring the peace process , says NATO could be stuck in Bosnia indefinitely unless major powers lean on Serb authorities to allow Brcko refugees to move back . 
&quot; If we don &apos;t see any return of refugees , then you get to the stage in which the only way to get home is to fight , &quot; Chris Bennett , an analyst with ICG , told Reuters .
