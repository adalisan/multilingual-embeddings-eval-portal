Brazil &apos;s real dropped 0.03 percent to close at 1.0416 against the dollar in calm trading due to dollar inflows in the commercial foreign exchange market , dealers said . 
in the afternoon the Central Bank bought dollars at 1.0415 reais per greenback to drain excess dollars from the market . 
preliminary figures for commercial and financial foreign exchange contracts showed a Monday surplus of $ 130 million . 
the market was also calm due to the Central Bank auction of 550 million of dollar-indexed National Treasury Notes ( NTN-D ) . 
the auction helped diminish speculation over a possible acceleration of real-dollar mini-band devaluations . 
on Friday , the Central Bank surprised the market lowering the mini-band 0.14 percent by buying dollars at 1.0415 and selling at 1.0465 reais . 
dealers said they expect another calm trade session on Tuesday . 
in the interbank forex floating rate market , the real closed at 1.0473 to the dollar , down 0.05 percent . 
in the illegal parallel market , the real rose 1.35 percent to end at 1.100 per greenback due to a reduction in the demand and an increase in the supply of dollars .
