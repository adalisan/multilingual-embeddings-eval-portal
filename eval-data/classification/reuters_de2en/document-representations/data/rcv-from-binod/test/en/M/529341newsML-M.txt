CME hog futures were expected to open steady to 0.200 cent per lb lower while pork belly futures were expected to open steady to 0.200 cent higher , livestock analysts said . 
an easier tone in cash hog markets and the futures market &apos;s overbought status was expected to weigh on hog futures early . 
packers are not willing to aggressively compete for cash hogs based on poor product margins . 
margins remain in the red despite higher pork cutout values Monday , they said . 
however , technical strength an a higher CME hog index may lend support , some sources noted . 
pork belly futures were expected to show carryover gains after Monday &apos;s sharp advance and posting of new contract highs linked to higher cash belly prices and a technically strong market . 
cash bellies ranged up to $ 84 per cwt , the highest prices since late September , 1996 , sources noted . 
the market has been rallying since it was announced Japan would be buying U.S. pork bellies until late May to supplement needs through the end of the year because of the Taiwan pork ban , they added . 
estimates on Tuesday afternoon &apos;s weekly CME out-of-town report ranged from in 250,000 to 500,000 lbs versus a net in-movement of 353,000 lbs last week and in-movement of 1.609 million lbs last year .
