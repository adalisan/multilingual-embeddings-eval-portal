Britain and the Netherlands have failed to reach targets for reducing fishing capacity to save dwindling stocks and to ensure a long term future for the industry , a European Commission report said on Friday . 
Britain and the Netherlands were respectively four percent and 48 percent short of the 1992-96 fleet tonnage reduction target and will lose EU aid for fleet renewal and modernisation . 
they were also ordered to catch up the backlog . 
some countries , notably Portugal , Spain , Denmark and Germany , were well within the tonnage targets and offset the slippage by the British and Dutch . 
Britain failed to meet the target partly because of its reluctance to help fund an EU programme to lay up vessels , EU sources said . 
the British , along with the Dutch , preferred to cut capacity by limiting the number of days vessels could spend at sea but ran into a legal wrangle . 
in April , EU fisheries ministers agreed by majority vote a new programme to cut fishing by up to 30 percent over five years in order to save endangered stocks . 
Britain voted against because it wanted the problem of Spanish and Dutch &quot; quota hoppers &quot; to be settled first . 
France also opposed the move because it sought a smaller cut over a shorter period .
