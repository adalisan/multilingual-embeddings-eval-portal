NYMEX gasoline led oil prices to a lower finish Friday on the prospect of more supply , as a large refinery owned by Tosco Corp was said to be restarting sooner than expected . 
&quot; The Tosco news seemed to really bear down on gasoline . 
there was a plenty of selling in the heat-to-gasoline spread , &quot; said a New York dealer . 
March gasoline ended 0.96 cent a gallon lower at 61.82 cents , losing 2.43 cents for the week . 
the union for workers of Tosco &apos;s Marcus Hook refinery in Pennsylvania said the 150,000 barrel a day refinery was set to restart three months early in April after extensive renovation . 
gasoline was sold in favor of heating oil after the spread had risen 1.50 cents to over five cents this week . 
the spread fell Friday to 3.97 cents . 
Tosco denied the April startup Friday afternoon and said it still planned a summer startup . 
April crude settled 30 cents lower at $ 21.39 a barrel as crude was sold in favor of heating oil after a recent sharp fall in the heating-to-crude crack spread . 
March heating oil finished off 0.19 cent at 57.85 cents a gallon , and the April heat crack rose to $ 2.40 from $ 2.16 a barrel Thursday . 
Tosco took title to the Marcus Hook plant last February , after acquiring the refinery for $ 25 million , and said it would spend another $ 50 million to upgrade , cutting the capacity from 180,000 bpd to concentrate on higher value light-end products , such as gasoline .
