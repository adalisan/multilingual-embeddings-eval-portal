rival Iraqi Kurdish groups were to begin U.S.-brokered peace talks in the Turkish capital on Wednesday to end more than two months of factional fighting , diplomats said . 
U.S. envoy Robert Pelletreau , a British diplomat and Turkish officials will oversee negotiations between the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) . 
KDP leader Massoud Barzani and rival faction head Jalal Talabani will not attend the talks , scheduled to last two or three days . 
Pelletreau brokered a ceasefire between the Kurds last week after clashes throughout the mountainous north of Iraq . 
Barzani joined forces with Baghdad in late August to take the key city of Arbil from the PUK , prompting U.S. missile strikes against targets in southern Iraq . 
both Talabani and Tehran deny this .
