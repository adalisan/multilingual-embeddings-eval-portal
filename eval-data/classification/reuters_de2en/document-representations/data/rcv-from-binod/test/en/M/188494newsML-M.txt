implied volatility of BTP options traded on LIFFE rose on Thursday as Italian bond futures set a new all-time high , options traders said . 
&quot; Everybody is taking it that the upside ( on BTPs ) is being extended and volatility has moved up on the back of that , &quot; said Steven West , a broker at GNI in London . 
West said implied volatility of December options was 9.2 percent , up from a close of around 8.95 percent on Wednesday . 
West said it was hard to say whether vols would maintain this upward push . 
&quot; If we get stuck in a range , Vol will come off again but if we continue forging ahead it will continue to rise , but that depends on the rate at which we move up , &quot; he said . 
an options trader in Milan pointed to big open interest in 127.00 and 128.00 December calls ( 9,000 and 20,000 lots respectively ) as a reason for the market to keep going up . 
&quot; Today and yesterday people kept on trading these upside calls and call spreads , with strikes around 128 to 129 , even 130 , &quot; said the Milan trader , adding that 25,000 lots had been traded altogether . 
he said December volatility in normal circumstances would be easing markedly due to time decay as the contract expires in seven days . 
traders said positive news expected soon on the budget and inflation figures should continue to lift BTPs higher . 
the Milan trader said the 1997 budget was expected to complete its passage through the lower house of parliament by the end of this week . 
on inflation , he said there were widespread expectations that the consumer price figures for November , which will start to be issued on a city-by-city basis on November 21 , would show a rise for the month of 2.6 percent or possibly even 2.5 percent , compared with three percent in October .
