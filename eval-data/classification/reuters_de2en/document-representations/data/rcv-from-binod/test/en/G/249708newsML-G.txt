Algiers city authorities have banned a march planned by the secular Socialist Forces Front ( FFS ) in the Algerian capital , the party said on Wednesday . 
Party spokesman Abdeslam Ali Rachedi said by telephone the march on Thursday was supposed to be in &quot; support of peace , democracy and social justice , but above all , peace . 
&quot; Alas , there is still no peace , &quot; he said , referring to the killing of 20 people on a bus in Blida province just south of Algiers early on Wednesday morning . 
Algiers city authorities refused permission on Tuesday for the proposed march . 
the FFS , whose stronghold is in the Berber Kabylie mountain region of the northeast , is the main secular opposition party to the authorities . 
it opposed recent constitutional changes that will ban parties based on religion , language or regionalisation . 
the new constitution , signed into force this month by President Liamine Zeroual , also makes Arabic the official language , angering those who want Berber as an alternative .
