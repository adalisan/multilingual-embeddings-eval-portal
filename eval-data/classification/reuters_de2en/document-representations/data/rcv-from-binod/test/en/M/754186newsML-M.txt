U.S. treasuries were well supported around Tokyo levels in London on Thursday , but will struggle to make much upside progress in the near term , analysts said . 
&quot; There isn &apos;t a huge focus today , but in the short run the underlying backdrop is still very very healthy , &quot; said Philip Tyson , senior international economist at HSBC Markets in London . 
&quot; It will probably be difficult to make fresh progress today in the absence of any real news , but I think the market will stay reasonably well supported , trading in a very narrow range . 
by 1000 GMT , the 30-year long bond was at 102-18 to yield 6.43 percent , up from 102-16 in Tokyo and New York . 
the 10-year paper was at 103-16 versus 103-15 in Tokyo and 103-14 in New York . 
one trader at a U.S. house in London said some investors were looking to buy 10-year paper and sell bonds . 
he said there was some swap selling in three year notes and noted Asian central bank buying of five year notes . 
&quot; It &apos;s been pretty active across the curve in all types of accounts except real money , &quot; said the trader . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been seeing a bit of redistribution after the five year auction . 
I &apos;d look for a bit more of that this morning , but I think the market will find a base here or a bit lower . 
investors snapped up the Treasury &apos;s sale of $ 11.5 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday . 
Tyson expected the tone across the curve , particularly at the longer end , to stay positive . 
&quot; If anything , there might be a slight flattening bias from here , &quot; he said . 
the only data on the agenda for Thursday was initial jobless claims for the week ending July 19 , seen having minimal impact on the market . 
according to a Reuter poll , economists expected the figure to come in at 333,000 versus 349,000 in the previous week . 
analysts said with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s Humphrey Hawkins testimony out of the way , the market would now turn its attention to Tuesday &apos;s employment cost index for the second quarter and the July payrolls data on Friday next week . 
&quot; That will show how the economy is looking into the third quarter , &quot; said Tyson .
