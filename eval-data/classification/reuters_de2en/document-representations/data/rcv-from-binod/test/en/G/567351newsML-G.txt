German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on a visit to Egypt on Wednesday defended his country &apos;s abstention from a United Nations vote condemning Israel &apos;s building of settlements in Jerusalem . 
Kinkel held talks in Luxor with Egypt &apos;s President Hosni Mubarak , who plays a role in the Middle East peace process by consulting often with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
Germany broke ranks with its European Union ( EU ) partners when it abstained from a United Nations General Assembly vote in April which demanded a halt to the construction of the Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem . 
&quot; This issue had a big place in our talks , &quot; Kinkel told reporters after his talks with Mubarak and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa . 
&quot; We have said that our abstention was because of our view that the proposal ( in the U.N. ) was not balanced . 
&quot; It does not mean that our policy has changed . 
we are against the settlements , &quot; Kinkel said before leaving for Germany . 
the session was the fourth time a U.N. body debated the Israeli decision in March to build 6,500 homes for Jews at the site , called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic , captured in the 1967 Middle East war . 
virtually all speakers in the U.N. session criticised Israel &apos;s action . 
most of those who abstained felt the resolution would not help the Middle East peace process . 
peace talks between Israel and Palestinians stalled after the Israelis broke ground on the settlement . 
U.S. and EU envoys were in the region on Wednesday trying to break the deadlock . 
Moussa told reporters the EU should increase its role as a broker of the peace process . 
&quot; As much as we were disappointed with Germany &apos;s abstention , in that it is a friendly country which understands developments in the Middle East and realises the danger of the settlement policy , the minister &apos;s presence and the messages that he sent and Germany &apos;s assurance that it opposes settlements and that it will stand against settlement policy , all of this naturally reduced the effect of the whole issue . 
&quot; Moussa said .
