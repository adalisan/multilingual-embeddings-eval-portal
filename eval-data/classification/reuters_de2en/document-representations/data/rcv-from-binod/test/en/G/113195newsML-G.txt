President Bill Clinton on Sunday defended himself against Republican charges that he is a big-government liberal as he began preparing for his second and last debate against challenger Bob Dole . 
&quot; The government cannot solve all your problems with a big bureaucracy . 
that government is gone , &quot; Clinton told about 5,000 cheering supporters at a rally in Albuquerque &apos;s historic downtown on a sunny autumn day . 
later , he went into a debate-preparation session at his hotel with senior White House officials and former Sen. George Mitchell of Maine , who is playing the role of Dole in the sessions . 
aides said he may not need as much time to prepare for the San Diego confrontation on Wednesday night as it will be his second debate against Dole . 
White House aides said no special attention would be given to answering &quot; character &quot; accusations , despite increasing Republican talk about them . 
they said the &quot; town hall &quot; format of the debate made it likely that members of the audience who pose the questions will ask about larger issues . 
&quot; The people of the United States are not interested in the kinds of things the Dole campaign is raising , &quot; said deputy White House press secretary Mary Ellen Glynn . 
&quot; They &apos;re interested in things that are relevant to their lives . 
White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes said the Republican attacks represent &quot; a sign of desperation on the part of the Dole campaign . 
they don &apos;t have a programme for the future . 
they know it and the American people know it and so they are trying to scrape up anything they can find . 
Clinton came to New Mexico , a state he won in 1992 and expects to win this year , after an overnight visit to Colorado . 
trying to burnish his credentials as a crime-fighter , he announced in Denver that he had made it a federal crime for anyone to use the sedative Rohypnol , which has become infamous as &quot; the date rape drug &quot; after a series of incidents in which victims were drugged by acquaintances and then raped . 
Clinton signed the drug-induced Rape Prevention and Punishment Act of 1996 . 
it toughens the penalties to those who traffic in the drug , making it comparable to the penalties that apply to the manufacture , distribution , importation and exportation of heroin , cocaine and other illegal drugs . 
possession of more than one gramme of the drug can lead to a prison term up to 20 years and a fine up to $ 1 million . 
the law also applies to other illegal drugs used with the intent to commit a violent crime . 
&quot; Today I sign legislation to crack down on criminals who employ illegal drugs in a sick attempt to facilitate their violent crime . 
this law will strengthen penalties against anyone who uses the date rape drug Rohypnol in connection with violent crime , &quot; he said . 
in Albuquerque , Clinton appeared to be laying the groundwork for a defence of his government philosophy , under attack by Republicans who say that while he talks about smaller government , they fear he will want to expand Washington &apos;s bureaucracy if given a second term . 
he said he had created the smallest national government since John Kennedy was president and reduced federal regulations more in three years than Republican presidents had done in the previous 12 . 
&quot; I believe that the national government &apos;s responsibility is to do those things that we must do together . 
my opponent says , &apos; Oh , the president thinks the government knows best . 
now , if we fall for that one again we ought to be ashamed of ourselves , &quot; he said . 
he also accused Republicans of having a holier-than-thou attitude about government . 
&quot; Their theory is that once you get elected to public office , you no longer belong to the people . 
you lose all your common sense and you become the enemy -- unless you &apos;re a Republican , in which case you don &apos;t , &quot; he said . 
at the same time , he vowed to protect federal funding for two national research laboratories important to this area &apos;s economy , Los Alamos and Sandia .
