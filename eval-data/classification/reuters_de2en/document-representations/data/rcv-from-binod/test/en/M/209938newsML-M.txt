grain and soybean fob values were steady on Friday in very quiet conditions as brokers shifted their attention to logistics rather than trades , several export sources said . 
brokers noted northbound barge traffic in the upper Mississippi River was closed for the season but slow harvest progress meant there was still quite a bit of corn and soybeans to move . 
wheat markets were quiet as world buyers continued to look to Argentina for supplies . 
Argentine traders confirmed on Friday that Bulgaria bought 300,000 tonnes Argentine wheat . 
prices were said to be between $ 133 and $ 135 fob for January / March shipment . 
U.S. soft white wheat , the lowest priced variety , was at $ 152.50 fob on Friday , sources said . 
&quot; We &apos;re just not competitive , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; At this point , we &apos;re better off waiting until Argentina runs out . 
wheat brokers noted offers were quoted against CBOT March for soft red winter wheat . 
the December contract traded at a 20-1 / 4 cent per bushel premium to the March on Friday .
