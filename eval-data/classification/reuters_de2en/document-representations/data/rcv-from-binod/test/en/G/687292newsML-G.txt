German Chancellor Helmut Kohl plans to return a Rolex watch offered to world leaders at the G7 summit in Denver last week , a government spokesman said on Wednesday . 
Kohl , who had already turned down a pair of cowboy boots presented by U.S. President Bill Clinton , plans to send back the Rolex watch he was given last week . 
&quot; The Chancellor has no intention of accepting this gift and will return it to the Rolex company , &quot; a Bonn spokesman said on Wednesday , referring to the luxury timepiece given to him by the Swiss manufacturer . 
the German leader had earlier given his counterparts a lesson in the simple life by shunning the black Mercedes , Cadillacs and other state limousines on offer in Denver to travel to and fro sessions on an ordinary tour bus .
