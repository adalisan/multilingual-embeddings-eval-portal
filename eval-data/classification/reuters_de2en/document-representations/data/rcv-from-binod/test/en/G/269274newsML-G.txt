Bosnian Croat authorities freed four Bosnian Serb detainees on Friday in exchange for two Croat civilians in Serb custody , the United Nations said . 
the Serbs had been sentenced only the day before to 27 days in a Bosnian Croat jail for alleged spying , but U.N. monitors denounced the case as little more than hostage-taking designed to set up a swap for two detained Croat soldiers . 
Andrea Angeli , spokesman for the U.N. &apos; s International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) in north Bosnia , said the four Serbs -- who denied any wrongdoing -- were released from jail in Orasje and allowed to leave Croat territory on Friday afternoon . 
in exchange , two Croats who had been jailed in the northern Bosnian Serb town of Doboj went free . 
Angeli could not immediately say why the Croats had been held in Doboj . 
Alex Ivanko , IPTF spokesman in Sarajevo , said on Thursday after the Serbs were sentenced to prison that &quot; they were basically taken as hostages for the exchange of two HVO ( Bosnian Croat militia ) soldiers &quot; . 
Peter Fitzgerald , Commissioner of the IPTF , which monitors local police work and human rights standards in post-war Bosnia , asked Bosnian Croat authorities to release the four Serbs without conditions . 
the four Serbs were sentenced in Orasje a day after being detained by the HVO while crossing Croat-held territory between the Bosnian Serb towns of Bijeljina and Bosanski Brod in the ethnically-divided country . 
two other Serbs were freed after questioning .
