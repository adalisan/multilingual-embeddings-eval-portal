Aranxta Sanchez Vicario was writing herself off earlier this year and the Wimbledon bookmakers agreed with her . 
after some miserable results and no tournament wins for a year , the normally exuberant Spaniard had lost her motivation and was slipping down the rankings . 
&quot; Every athlete goes through a tough moment and it &apos;s been very hard , &quot; she said after displaying all her old vigour and skill against Mary Pierce on Tuesday to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals . 
although she had been runner-up here the past two years and champion Steffi Graf is out through injury , some bookmakers priced her at an outsider &apos;s 20-1 before the tournament . 
she is now a 9-2 chance . 
they had not reckoned on Sanchez Vicario &apos;s indomitable spirit and the influence of her close family back in Barcelona . 
it was brother Emilio , a former top 20 player in his own right , who took over as her coach in March and badgered and cajoled her on to the tennis court when she did not feel like training , helping her shots and boosting her confidence . 
&quot; Working with my brother helped a lot , &quot; she said . 
&quot; He &apos;s the person who knows me best and he helped me to come back and start practising again strong and hard . 
&quot; He gave me my motivation back and made me start pushing myself and believing in myself and working hard , &quot; she added . 
the 25-year-old Spaniard has come back in style . 
she reached the final of the pre-Wimbledon Eastbourne tournament , which was rained off . 
and she has dropped only 13 games in four rounds on her way to the Wimbledon quarter-finals . 
she blew away Pierce , seeded nine to her eight , 6-1 6-3 in 57 minutes . 
&quot; I could have won easier than 6-3 in the second set , &quot; she said . 
the busy Spaniard , brought up on Iberian clay , buzzed about the baseline , ran down every ball , and even attacked the net , something she has learned to do in 11 appearances at Wimbledon . 
after turning professional before her 14th birthday , becoming the youngest French Open champion at the age of 17 in 1989 and reaching 11 Grand Slam finals , Sanchez Vicario should perhaps have been expected to hit a bad patch sooner or later . 
Unluckily for her opponents it looks as though the patch may be over already .
