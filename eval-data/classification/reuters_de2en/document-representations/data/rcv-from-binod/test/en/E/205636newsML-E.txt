inflation has picked up a little bit recently , but is still mainly under control , Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert McTeer said on Thursday . 
&quot; Inflation is still primarily under pretty good control , &quot; he told a conference sponsored by the Dallas Fed and the Small Corporate offering Registration group . 
McTeer said inflation indicators , such as commodity prices , turned down several months ago . 
and while wages and employee compensation have been rising faster than productivity , pushing up unit Labor costs , that has so far not translated into big price rises , he said . 
McTeer contrasted the situation now with that in 1994 , when the Fed embarked on a series of interest rate increases . 
rates then were lower than they are now and there was a &quot; lot of inflation in the pipeline , &quot; he said . 
while inflation is mainly under control now , it should be lower , according to McTeer . 
&quot; It &apos;s not low enough , &quot; he said . 
he told his audience that the power of the Fed was sometimes overstated . 
&quot; Monetary policy is very important but so are a lot of other things , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We certainly don &apos;t have any dials we can dial up the perfect economy . 
although , in these days , in one respect , we do have almost a perfect economy , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been operating at pretty well maximum capacity , &quot; the Fed official added .
