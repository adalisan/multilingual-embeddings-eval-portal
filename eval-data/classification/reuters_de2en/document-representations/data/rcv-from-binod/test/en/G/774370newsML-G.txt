Australian Tom Moody rewrote the English Sunday League record books for his adopted county Worcestershire . 
Moody completed 4,000 runs in the 40 overs competition during the match against Kent at Worcester , reaching the landmark in fewer innings than any other player . 
the Australian all-rounder passed the milestone in 100 innings , including 14 for his former county Warwickshire . 
the previous record had been 106 innings by South African opener Barry Richards for Hampshire in 1976 . 
Worcestershire captain Moody said : &quot; I was not aware of the records but they are there to be broken and it &apos;s an honour to pass someone like Barry Richards . 
Moody scored 26 against Kent in a match washed out by rain after his side reached 117 for three off 24 overs . 
a telling all-round display by Darren Maddy for Leicestershire thwarted Essex &apos;s bid to go to the top of the league . 
Maddy struck 75 from 61 balls and then claimed the last three Essex wickets for 17 in 3.3 overs as Leicester won by 35 runs at Colchester . 
Leicester made 225 for nine in their 40 overs and bowled Essex out for 190 , pace Bowler James Ormond taking three for 30 including England middle order batsman Nasser Hussain for a duck . 
Warwickshire , joint leaders with Lancashire , maintained their 100 per cent home league record with victory over Sussex in a rain-curtailed match at Edgbaston . 
after restricting Sussex to 162 for nine , South African fast Bowler Allan Donald capturing three for 31 , Warwickshire made 102 for three in 22 overs to win on faster run rate . 
Australian batsman Darren Lehmann played a key role as a Bowler in Yorkshire &apos;s 38-run victory over Northamptonshire at Headingley . 
Lehmann &apos;s slow left arm deliveries earned him three for 43 as Yorkshire , whose attack was below strength because of injuries , dismissed Northnats for 201 . 
Durham batsman Jon Lewis completed a memorable weekend by helping his team to record a win double against Derbyshire at Chester-le-Street . 
following his 160 not out in the championship victory on Saturday , Lewis applied the finishing touches to a five-wicket Sunday League win with a valuable 36 . 
Durham , facing their opponents &apos; 181 for nine , recovered from 29 for two to ease home with two overs to spare at 185 for five .
