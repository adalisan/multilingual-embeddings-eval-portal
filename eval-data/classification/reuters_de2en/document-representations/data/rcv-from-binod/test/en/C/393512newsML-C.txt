ninety of Nigeria &apos;s 190 textiles companies have been in trouble since the military government lifted the ban on importation of textiles , according to the head of their association . 
Walid Jibrin , chairman of the Nigeria Textiles Manufacturers Association ( NTMA ) , told industries minister Lieutenant-General Muhammadu Haladu on Thursday in the capital Abuja that 11 of the 90 had shut down operations . 
Seventy-three others were in distress while the remaining six were on the verge of shedding their staff , he said . 
in January , government announced in its fiscal budget that textiles could now be imported into the country . 
Jibrin said : &quot; importation of textiles is capable of killing local initiatives . 
more textiles industries will die off by the end of this year if government does not reverse its stand . 
&quot; smuggling of sub-standard textiles materials is being encouraged while Nigeria will become a dumping ground for inferior fabrics , &quot; he added . 
Haladu disagreed with Jibrin , saying government lifted the ban on textiles imports in order to encourage competition among local manufacturers and enhance productivity . 
the cost of locally-produced fabrics did not drop when the ban was in force , Haladu said , adding that the period within which the ban was lifted was too short for the industries to begin to face problems .
