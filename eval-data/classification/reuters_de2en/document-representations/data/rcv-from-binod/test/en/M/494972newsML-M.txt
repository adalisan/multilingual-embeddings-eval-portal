Dutch money market rates were stable on Tuesday , while the guilder gained versus the mark . 
dealers said the guilder was likely to linger between 112.35 / 60 per 100 marks as players were getting used to a slightly more volatile guilder . 
the guilder was trading at 112.47 per 100 marks today versus 112.51 on Monday . 
dealers said overall money market business was thin , but noted some interest for Dutch Treasury certificates ( DTCs ) , the government &apos;s short-term borrowing instrument . 
on Monday the Finance Ministry said it was opening a new DTC programme which matures on June 30 . 
the finance ministry already had three DTC programmes open , maturing on April 29 , May 30 and December 31 . 
dealers said interest was concentrated on the new June programme which was priced at 3.16 percent in early trade and at 3.15 percent later on . 
&quot; The December issue was priced at 3.25 percent , but I have not heard of any business in this contract , &quot; said one dealer . 
dealers said the Dutch March inflation figure which was released this morning had no impact on the market . 
the Dutch March consumer price index ( CPI ) rose 2.0 percent year-on-year , a slightly lower figure than most conomists had expected .
