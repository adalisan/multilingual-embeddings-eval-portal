currency fluctuations , interest-rate uncertainty and an array of domestic concerns present a mixed outlook for Asian stocks next week . 
the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates following testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan last week could continue to dampen sentiment in Hong Kong and Singapore , but Tokyo expected to avoid any major sell-off thanks to recent strong gains by the Japanese yen . 
Malaysian stocks were seen as the coming week &apos;s best bet , with reports of a move back into first-liners after the recent red-hot performance of some of the market &apos;s small stocks . 
Singapore traders expected to lose some buyers to Malaysia due to their own market &apos;s lacklustre tone . 
little change was expected in the smaller markets of Jakarta , Manila , and Bangkok , all of which were trading on domestic factors . 
Tokyo - Tokyo stocks will be looking for direction next week , but should avoid sharp plunges as the end of the fiscal year approaches , traders said . 
&quot; Financial institutions are going to sell some of their stock holdings , especially those of expensive , high-technology firms , to make up for shortfalls ahead of the book-closing , &quot; said Akishige Ishikura , analyst at Dai-ichi Securities . 
&quot; blue-chip rallies from now on are likely to be sporadic as shareholders will sell whenever the prices rise , &quot; he added . 
blue-chip buying slowed on Friday when the yen powered to the 119 level against the U.S. dollar for the first time since January 28 . 
in addition to currency uncertainty , Tokyo stocks will confront position-squaring this week ahead of the settlement of the March futures and options expiry on March 14 . 
on Friday , the 225-share Nikkei average ended the week down 464.56 points or 2.44 percent at 18,557.00 . 
with February U.S. employment data due on Friday , analysts said investors were likely to remain cautious . 
&quot; I think the payrolls report could prompt a further selloff in Hong Kong , &quot; said Alan Hutcheson , director of research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
the Hang Seng Index ended last week on a shaky note , tumbling 147.88 points , or 1.09 percent , to 13,398.72 on Friday after U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan hinted last week the central bank may need to raise rates in coming months . 
for the week , the index fell 46.13 points , or 0.34 percent . 
Kuala Lumpur - Malaysian stocks are expected to gain ground next week driven by an influx of funds , a friendly economic backdrop and positive corporate results , brokers said . 
investors are also gradually moving into bigger-capitalised stocks from smaller ones . 
&quot; We should see a gradual swell moving into the composite Index , &quot; said one broker . 
&quot; And then , we should start seeing foreign investors ( coming in ) . 
for the week , the benchmark composite Index closed 7.81 points higher or 0.62 percent at 1,270.67 on Friday . 
Taipei - volatile trade is forecast on the Taipei exchange after the index soared to a six-year high of 7,983.71 on Saturday , up 243.77 points or 3.14 percent on the week .

the Taipei index &apos;s Saturday close was its highest since May 16 , 1990 . 
Jakarta - Jakarta shares are seen mixed in the coming week as the market adopts a wait-and-see attitude to a possible hike in U.S. interest rates . 
speculative buying could keep the index at current levels around 700 even though many investors expect to see continued selling . 
brokers said further weakness is likely in cigarette maker Sampoerna following lower-than-expected 1996 earnings . 
on Friday , the Jakarta composite index closed 8.87 points or 1.27 percent stronger at 705.37 compared to 696.50 last Friday . 
Bangkok - The Thai stock market is likely to see some selling pressure especially in finance stocks following news that the country &apos;s largest finance company , Finance One , and Thai Danu Bank plan to merge , analysts said . 
local newspapers and finance ministry officials said on Saturday the two agreed to merge , which is likely to fuel concerns about the soundness of Finance One and other finance companies . 
neither firm could be reached for comment . 
&quot; The merger is a confirmation that Finance One may have some financial probles , &quot; said Kasem Prunratanamala , a banking analyst at HSBC James Capel Asia . 
finance One has denied rumours this week that it faced a run on deposits from major clients . 
&quot; Investors will now begin to question the stability and health of other finance firms after the news , &quot; he said . 
the SET index dropped 2.69 percent in the week to 727.56 points on Friday from last Thursday . 
the market was closed on Friday for a holiday but gained 0.21 percent from Thursday . 
Manila - Philippine shares are likely to remain wedged in a tight range next week on a lack of corporate news . 
brokers said speculative issues , such as mining and oil shares , could attract attention from investors seeking short-term profits but blue chips will come under pressure from foreign funds positioning themselves for the Equitable initial public offering . 
equitable Banking Corp is offering 85.412 million shares on March 5 at 113.30 pesos each or 19-times forecast 1997 earnings , with a planned listing date of April 3 .

the STI was seen trading narrowly within 2,150 and 2,300 next week , after testing support at 2,190 on broad institutional selling this week . 
the STI index ended 5.07 points higher at 2,195.70 on Friday against 2,241.28 on February 21 .
