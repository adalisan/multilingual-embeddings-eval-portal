the Sri Lankan government on Wednesday appealed for calm after a lawmaker from the ruling coalition was shot and killed on the eve of the deadline for nominating candidates to next month &apos;s key local elections . 
&quot; I appeal to all sections of the community not to be disturbed by this incident and to make every effort to have a peaceful poll , &quot; Media Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake said . 
&quot; This is the beginning of a plot to destroy government efforts to have a peaceful election , &quot; he said in a statement . 
on Tuesday , unknown gunmen shot and killed lawmaker Nalanda Ellawala , 29 , of the People &apos;s Alliance , when he and his supporters got embroiled in a roadside quarrel with rival supporters of the opposition United National Party ( UNP ) , police said . 
the clash occurred at Kuruwita , 80 km ( 50 miles ) south of Colombo . 
the assailants also killed the guard of another ruling coalition legislator and injured five others , police said . 
police said no arrests had been made . 
Kuruwita police said they were trying to question supporters of the UNP who were at the scene of the shooting , but declined to identify them . 
police declared a curfew in Kuruwita overnight after unidentified people set fire to shops and homes of UNP supporters . 
police said the night curfew could be reimposed in the area on Wednesday , which was reported to be tense but calm . 
in Tuesday &apos;s incident , groups of party supporters were on the road canvassing the predominantly farming area ahead of the polls , tentatively scheduled for March 27 . 
the polls are President Chandrika Kumaratunga &apos;s first political test since 1994 when her People &apos;s Alliance toppled the UNP from 17 years in power after winning general and presidential elections . 
in a brief statement to a Sri Lankan daily on Wednesday , UNP leader Ranil Wickremasinghe expressed grief over Ellawala &apos;s killing . 
Kumaratunga has repeatedly called for a peaceful election campaign and stressed that no election abuses would be tolerated .
