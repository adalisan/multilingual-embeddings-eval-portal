Slovenia &apos;s SBI index firmed one percent on Wednesday , pushed up by foreign demand that focused on pharmaceutical producer Lek . 
Lek , the most actively traded share , firmed 1.12 percent to 36,000 tolars on volume of 2,597 shares for total turnover of 93.4 million tolars . 
traders said strong foreign interest should contribute to further growth over the coming months . 
&quot; I believe shares will continue rising to the end of the year , with downward corrections from time to time , due to the strong foreign demand , &quot; said Alain Al Soufi of brokerage BPH . 
he forecast the SBI would reach 1,650 points by the end of this month and over 2,000 points by year-end . 
overall 14 shares rose , one was unchanged , five fell and eight were untraded . 
turnover fell to 229.6 million tolars from 362 million . 
financial consultancy Primofin was the top gainer , closing 10 percent higher at 9,900 tolars on volume of 10 shares in a rebound after Friday &apos;s fall of 14.29 percent . 
trader Kovinotehna led decliners , down 4.72 percent to 505 tolars on volume of 3,619 shares but analysts said the share should recover shortly as the price was low considering the firm &apos;s good business results . 
&quot; Kovinotehna is probably the most undervalued share on our bourse market , &quot; Al Soufi said .
