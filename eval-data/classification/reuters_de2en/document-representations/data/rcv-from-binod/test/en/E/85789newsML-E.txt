Brazilian Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola said Monday that Brazil seeks to replace some of its domestic debt with foreign borrowings , but such moves would depend on market conditions . 
&quot; The idea is not to replace all the debt , but just part of it , &quot; Loyola told Reuters prior to a conference here . 
on Sunday , Brazil announced that it would issue about $ 750 million of 5- or 10-year Yankee bonds . 
Loyola said he could not comment on the Yankee issue , but said Brazil intended to use foreign debt markets to replace expensive domestic obligations . 
the Brazilian government said Sunday that it would use the Yankee issue to retire domestic debt . 
Loyola told Reuters that the government would buy up domestic debt depending on financial market conditions . 
&quot; It depends on market conditions , but it &apos;s a decision we &apos;re taking on a case-by-case basis , &quot; he said . 
the central bank president said Brazil had not yet decided whether to use a Mexico-style swap or to use international reserves as a way to buy back some of its Brady bonds . 
&quot; It could be both , but we don &apos;t have a decision on that , &quot; Loyola said . 
&quot; We would be seeking the best terms for Brazil .
