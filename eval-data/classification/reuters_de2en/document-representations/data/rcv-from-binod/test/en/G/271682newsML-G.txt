a bridge under construction in southern China has collapsed , burying dozens of workers under tonnes of debris and killing at least 24 people , officials said on Saturday . 
a 100-metre ( yard ) section of the almost-finished 160-metre bridge spanning a valley between Pingshi and Ruyuan counties in northern Guangdong province gave way on Friday morning , an official of the local television station said by telephone . 
rescue workers , backed by police , had searched through the night for survivors under the debris , said an official from the health bureau in the nearby city of Shaoguan who had visited the scene . 
&quot; More than 90 people were working at the construction site when the bridge collapsed , and many of them were injured , &quot; he said . 
at least 24 people had been killed and 63 injured , said another local official who declined to be identified . 
the task of digging through the rubble had been virtually completed at the scene near Ruyuan , an area populated by the Yao ethnic minority , about 150 km ( 90 miles ) north of the provincial capital Guangzhou , officials said . 
a local resident living near the bridge estimated the casualties at about 100 people killed or injured , most of them migrant workers from Henan and Hebei provinces in central and north China who were building the bridge . 
the health official said most of the injured had cuts or broken bones , and the most seriously hurt had been removed to hospitals in Shaoguan for treatment . 
health authorities had sent 11 ambulances and several dozen doctors and nurses to the scene , he said . 
an official at the Yuebei People &apos;s Hospital in Shaoguan said doctors were treating five injured workers , and all were in stable condition . 
another eight had been admitted to the Shaoguan Number One People &apos;s Hospital where one had died and the rest were expected to survive , officials said . 
officials said the cause of the collapse was being investigated .
