while the Reserve Bank board does not meet during January , the market was affected on Tuesday and Wednesday by rumours of secret RBA meetings and imminent rate cut announcements . 
based on economists &apos; forecasts , the outlook for rates is fairly evenly divided . 
those looking for a cut point to continued soft retail and labour market data , as well as moderating inflation and a belief that the U.S will not raise rates early in 1997 . 
those not expecting a cut say that the impact of the three cuts made in the second half of last year has not yet been seen , and with activity expected to pick up through 1997 , further cuts would be unnecessarily pro-cyclical . 
if a cut is going to come , economists said the window of opportunity is the first quarter . 
after the first quarter there is likely to be some stronger data that may preclude further rate cuts , economists said .

housing finance - Although the median indicates a small rise , Australian Bankers Association data released late on Friday afternoon was suggesting a small fall , according to those who had seen the data . 
housing finance approvals appear to have formed a base around 40,000 in the second half of 1996 and economists said the November and December rate cuts should help keep the market in recovery mode through early 1997 . 
labour FORCE - One of the weakest areas of the economy in 1996 , and a key factor behind the three rate cuts of the second half of the year , the employment picture is expected to have stayed gloomy in December . 
after two months of solid above trend growth ( up 24,400 in November , up 25,500 in October ) some are looking for growth to have been fairly weak in December , bringing it back in line with the trend . 
the break-up of the last two months growth has been interesting , with much of the recent strength coming from part time employment -- it accounted 34,500 of the 49,900 new jobs in the last two months .
