Mali &apos;s President Alpha Oumar Konare was sworn in on Sunday for a second term as about 100 opposition protesters attacked public buildings in the capital . 
the May 11 presidential election was boycotted by main opposition parties protesting over a chaotic parliamentary poll in April which was annulled by the constitutional court . 
Konare won 84.36 percent of the vote , but turnout was just 28 percent . 
the protesters threw stones at traffic lights and destroyed equipment at the telecommunications company headquarters . 
there was no immediate word on arrests . 
the ceremony at Bamako &apos;s Palace of Congress was attended by the presidents of Senegal , Burkina Faso and Mauritania , and by Charles Josselin , new junior minister for cooperation in France , Mali &apos;s former colonial power . 
the French foreign ministry said Josselin brought a message of congratulations from Prime Minister Lionel Jospin , who took power after a leftist alliance defeated the centre-right in last Sunday &apos;s French parliamentary election . 
Konare , embarking on his second and final five-year mandate , pledged to fight poverty in his arid , landlocked country , and said Mali was on the right track after its first five years of multi-party rule . 
&quot; If high office has taught me one thing , it is certainly the difference between ideals and reality , &quot; he said . 
Mali was widely praised for its 1992 transition from Moussa Traore &apos;s dictatorship to a multi-party system . 
military leader Amadou Toumani Toure stepped down after 14 months and now often mediates in regional political crises .
