trading in the Singapore rubber market was thin by midday on Friday with most of the business having flown to the Thai rubber centre of hat Yai for an industry dinner , dealers said . 
traders said the only sign of business was the bid of a foreign brokerage house to offer several hundred tonnes of RSS3 grade rubber at around 108.00 U.S. cents a kg . 
&quot; It &apos;s very , very quiet . 
most of the big boys flew to Thailand on Wednesday . 
we may only see some action maybe by next week , &quot; one trader said . 
the only spot business done in the morning was for 25 tonnes of RSS1 grade rubber , dealers said . 
&quot; I &apos;m not sure if the trade will perk up this afternoon since most of the people are really on holiday , &quot; another dealer said . 
traders said the ongoing Golden Week holiday season in Japan has kept business in the local exchange subdued . 
at around 0445 GMT , June RSS3 was indicated at 107.00 U.S. cents a kg from 106.75 cents . 
September RSS1 was seen at 155.00-156.00 Singapore cents ( US $ 1.07- $ 1.08 ) a kg from 154.00 cents . 
June TSR20 was seen at 149.25-151.25 Singapore cents a kg ( US $ 1.03- $ 1.05 ) from 148.25 cents .
