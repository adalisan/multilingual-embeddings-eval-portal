the key June Japanese government bond futures contract ended higher on Friday due to investors &apos; strong demand for cash bonds , traders said . 
&quot; Investors haven &apos;t stopped buying , and this is inviting buy-backs of JGBs , &quot; a trust bank trader said . 
city banks have been selling medium-term cash JGBs and buying long-term cash JGBs in an effort to lengthen the duration of their bond holdings , the trader said . 
the June ended at 126.87 , up sharpy from the previous day &apos;s close of 126.58 . 
turnover was 41,890 contracts . 
the key 182nd JGB yield stood at an all-time low of 2.130 percent as of 0657 GMT , down from the previous day &apos;s close of 2.175 percent . 
public funds were apparently buying medium-term cash bonds , further fuelling the surge in JGBs , a trust bank trader said . 
comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , which contained no new references to the need for Japan to stimulate its economy , also made buying easier , traders said . 
Japan and the U.S. agreed in a meeting on Friday that Japan should promote economic growth led by domestic demand , a MOF official told reporters .
