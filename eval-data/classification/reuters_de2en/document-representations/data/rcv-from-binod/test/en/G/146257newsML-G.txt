Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross ahead of a possible summit with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Sunday to seal a deal on Hebron , an official said . 
but Palestinians said the two sides were still far from reaching a deal and that no preparations had been made for an Arafat-Netanyahu meeting . 
&quot; Ross is going up to the north where Netanyahu &apos;s visiting the navy to meet him . 
I presume he wouldn &apos;t go up there unless he thought there was a good chance of sealing the agreement today , &quot; said Netanyahu &apos;s top adviser David Bar-Illan . 
asked if Netanyahu would meet Arafat on Sunday , Bar-Illan said : &quot; It may happen . 
Arafat &apos;s aide Nabil Abu Rdainah said no arrangements had been made for a summit with Netanyahu . 
&quot; There are deep differences between the two positions . 
the same disputed issues are still disputed , &quot; Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said . 
Bar-Illan , Netanyahu &apos;s director of communications and policy planning , said Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had agreed on most details for implementing a long-overdue Israeli redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron and were awaiting Arafat &apos;s consent . 
&quot; Obviously they wouldn &apos;t meet if they didn &apos;t feel the time was ripe for tying up loose ends and reaching the agreement , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Arafat was due to leave Gaza on Monday on a European tour of several days . 
Bar-Illan said there would probably be no signing ceremony for the agreement , contrary to earlier Israel-PLO peace deals . 
Israel agreed more than a year ago to withdraw its troops from parts of Hebron but Netanyahu , elected last May , insisted on adjusting the agreement to help safeguard 400 Jewish settlers who live among 100,000 Palestinians in the West Bank town .
