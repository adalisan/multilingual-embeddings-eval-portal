the dollar slipped against the mark in morning Europe , breaking below 1.79 after comments from German Finance Minister Theo Waigel that Germany was interested in a strong mark . 
Waigel also said the strength of the dollar and sterling against the mark reflected market overreaction , prompting a two-pfennig drop in sterling / mark to just above the 3.00 marks level . 
&quot; There was talk the Bundesbank was checking rates around in the mid-1.79 area which capped earlier , then Waigel &apos;s comments were enough to take it lower , &quot; said a UK bank dealer . 
Waigel , speaking at a news conference in Berlin , said Germany was in contact with its G7 partners on forex developments . 
by 0745 GMT , dollar / mark was trading at 1.7856 / 61 marks from its early levels above 1.79 marks and below late Monday &apos;s European level of 1.7885 / 95 marks . 
the dollar soared to a near six-year high of 1.7995 marks in U.S. trade on Monday , eventually settling down in Asian trade . 
dealers said the market was extremely wary of coordinated intervention at 1.80 marks and vulnerable to Bundesbank verbal intervention to prevent it breaching that level . 
&quot; Our feeling is that that 1.80 will eventually be breached and we will see a move up to the 1.85 level , &quot; said Rob Hayward , economist at Bank of America . 
&quot; The fundamentals suggest people will remain very cautious about the European currencies . 
sentiment for a broad-based European monetary union and a resultant weaker euro has been the main backdrop for the weaker mark and the Bundesbank is keen not to let the mark weaken into the run-up to start of the single currency . 
&quot; But this has been an orderly trend higher , backed by fundamentals , there is no sentiment to reverse this trend ( for a weaker mark ) , &quot; said a German bank dealer . 
by mid-morning , sterling recovered almost all of its early fall on Waigel &apos;s remarks , rebounding off an intraday low of 3.0045 marks . 
the yen weakened slightly against the dollar and mark , extending overnight losses made after comments from senior Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) official Eisuke Sakakibara . 
the MOF official was reported to have said the market &apos;s expectations for a stronger yen were too high and the Group of Seven nations ( G7 ) had no intention of using foreign exchange rates as a trade tool . 
by 0833 GMT , the dollar was trading at 114.22 / 27 from 113.68 / 73 late Monday in Europe . 
mark / yen was firmer but off an early attempt to clear the 64.00 yen area , settling back to 63.74 / 77 compared with 63.52 / 55 late Monday . 
the mark was mostly steady on its crosses , off the earlier highs seen after Waigel &apos;s remarks . 
the Irish punt has come back slightly from Monday &apos;s levels which saw it trading over 13 percent above its central rate against the French franc within the exchange rate mechanism . 
the maximum allowed is 15 percent .
