the fanfare over Ukraine &apos;s first post-Soviet constitution has died away , but one question vital to a free market economy remains unanswered -- can land be privately owned ? 
diplomats and analysts studying the document , produced during an all-night session of parliament in late June , say no . 
&quot; The constitution guarantees everything under the sun but as far as Western-style land ownership , which is one of the foundations of a market economy , is concerned , it doesn &apos;t do it , &quot; said a Western diplomat . 
without such guarantees investors cannot know whether they will own the land on which their factories are built , those wishing to farm privately are wary of striking off on their own , and people wishing to build homes on property they own outright are forced to wait until the law of the land is clarified . 
&quot; This constitution is a step in the right direction but in order to accomplish the privatisation of agricultural land more specific reforms need to be legislated in the new civil and land codes , &quot; said Chuck Costanza , a project manager with the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) . 
private land ownership has long been a goal of President Leonid Kuchma &apos;s economic reform programme , started in late 1994 . 
but parliament , dominated by communists and their allies , has maintained that land must remain in public hands . 
there are no plans to let foreigners buy land either , and Western investors complain that their local joint ventures with Ukrainian companies are also unable to buy land . 
the IFC , the World Bank &apos;s private investment arm , has been running several land privatisation projects but , ultimately , the land has remained in state hands . 
some 35,000 private farmers who have been given government land face a six-year moratorium on its sale . 
Article 14 of the constitution states : &quot; The land is the main source of national wealth , which is under the special protection of the state . 
it continues : &quot; The property right on land is guaranteed . 
this right shall be acquired and executed by legal entities and state only according to the law . 
experts said the statement is not clear because it does not specify land ownership ; private , collective or state-owned . 
&quot; The language was watered down , so the constitution doesn &apos;t forbid it , and it doesn &apos;t guarantee it , &quot; said a Western diplomat . 
Kuchma , determined to push ahead with land reform and privatisation in the agriculture sector , has at times issued decrees ordering collective farms be divided -- only to add to the confusion of those trying to carry out his orders . 
&quot; Do you give more weight to the land code or to the decree , which gives you more freedom ? 
&quot; an analyst said . 
contradictory legislation in all walks of life , inherited from the days of the former Soviet Union , is a constant headache to foreign funding bodies and investors . 
Ukraine has attracted only about $ 1.5 billion in foreign investment since independence five years ago , but government officials predicted it would grow to $ 2 billion by the end of the year . 
the recently-reconvened parliament is unlikely to clarify the land issue through the civil and land codes , according to one Western diplomat . 
&quot; You can rest assured that the people who had it watered down in the constitution will try to have it watered down in these laws as well , &quot; he said . 
a new land code has been rejected twice by parliament , said Alexy Onyshenko , an IFC consultant and a professor for the Institute of Economic Studies with the National Academy of Sciences . 
&quot; This is a very complex political question , &quot; he said . 
&quot; As far as I can see the right to own land now exists but there are many people against it , who fear selling Ukrainian land . 
he said many bureaucrats , who carry a great deal of weight in post-Soviet society , stand in the way of land reform . 
&quot; Nothing will happen without a fight , &quot; Onyshenko said .
