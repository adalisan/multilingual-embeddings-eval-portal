police in southern Egypt may have found a motive for the massacre of 10 Christian youths by suspected Islamists after investigations showed that many of them had visited Israel , security sources said on Thursday . 
six gunmen shocked Egypt last week when they stormed a church in Abu Qurqas town and sprayed bullets into a youth meeting . 
police believe they belong to the militant Al-Gama &apos;a Al-Islamiya ( Islamic Group ) . 
the father of Adel Mikhail Abdel Malak , one of the youths killed in the attack , told reporters on Thursday that his son had worked in Israel for five months as had some of the others shot dead inside the church . 
southern police officials confirmed that some of the youths had spent several months in Israel and said this fact had added &quot; another dimension &quot; to the incident . 
a spokesman for the interior ministry in Cairo however said they did not have any idea about an Israeli connection . 
militants have often targeted policemen and sometimes Christians in their attempt to transform Egypt into a strict Islamic state but security sources said that this was the first time that gunmen attacked the interior of a church . 
although Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 , official relations are cool but run to hostility among most Egyptians , who still regard the Jewish state as the enemy . 
Moslem militant groups active in Egypt since 1992 are particularly venomous towards the Jewish state . 
last April , the Gama &apos;a said it had massacred 18 Greeks outside a Cairo hotel after mistaking them for Israelis .
