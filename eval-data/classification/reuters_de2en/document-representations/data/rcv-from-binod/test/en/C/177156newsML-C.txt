Swiss banking group CS Holding said it would buy or swap stock for the few remaining shares in subsidiaries Credit Suisse and Swiss Volksbank as part of a major restructuring announced last July 2 . 
&quot; If this offer is taken up in full , the value of the transaction will total 8.5 million Swiss francs , &quot; CS Holding said in a statement . 
CS Holding has 99.96 percent of all shares in its flagship bank Credit Suisse and through Credit Suisse holds 99.92 percent of all Swiss Volksbank shares . 
Swiss Volksbank will be merged into a reshaped retail banking division named Credit Suisse , one of four divisions that will make up the concern when CS Holding changes its name to Credit Suisse Group as of January 1 . 
CS Holding said it was offering holders of Credit Suisse bearer and registered shares the choice of a cash payment of 825 Swiss francs net per share or the exchange of one share for six CS Holding registered shares plus 75 francs cash . 
both offers are open from November 11 to November 25 . 
CS Holding said the offer applied to 1,045 registered and 6,570 bearer shares in Credit Suisse and 17,567 registered shares in Swiss Volksbank held by private individuals . 
CS Holding said it would declare invalid any remaining Credit Suisse and Swiss Volksbank shares after a new Federal Act of Stock Exchanges and Securities Trading enters into force , which is now expected to happen in the second quarter of 1997 .
