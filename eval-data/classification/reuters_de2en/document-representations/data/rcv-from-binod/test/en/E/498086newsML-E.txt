Romania &apos;s new centrist government signed a letter of intent on Wednesday for the resumption of International Monetary Fund credits , a key element in underpinning its drive for market reforms . 
finance Minister Mircea Ciumara and Central Bank chief Mugur Isarescu signed the letter and turned it over to the IMF &apos;s chief negotiator for Romania . 
the Fund &apos;s Board is to discuss restoration of credits to Romania , which were suspended last year while ex-communists were still in power , at a meeting later this month in Washington . 
neither side disclosed the contents of the letter . 
government sources say Romania is seeking about $ 400 million in credits from the IMF and up to $ 600 million from the World Bank . 
IMF negotiator Poul Thomsen said the government &apos;s reform programme , drawn up in February , was proceeding well . 
&quot; I &apos;m encouraged in many respects by the main stabilisation achieved by the government , &quot; he told reporters after the signing ceremony . 
&quot; We are pleased that the programme is on track and in some areas is doing better than ( planned ) . 
previous programmes have collapsed in months because of the lack of structural reforms . 
but he said the Fund still wanted assurances that measures on restructuring or closing down inefficient industries and farms &quot; will be put in place within weeks &quot; . 
he also said approval of an austerity budget , to be presented to parliament on Thursday , was vital to the programme &apos;s success . 
the government introduced steep price increases on staple goods and utilities in February and earlier this week rushed to approve a law on proceeding with delayed bank privatisation . 
the central bank has tightened monetary policy to restore confidence in the leu currency after removing restrictions on foreign exchange markets . 
the 1997 budget calls for monthly inflation , which hit a 45-month peak of 18.8 percent in February , to be reduced to 2.2 percent by the end of the year . 
the budget deficit , three times over target last year at 5.8 percent of gross domestic product , is to be pared to 4.5 percent this year . 
on the eve of Wednesday &apos;s ceremony , centrist President Emil Constantinescu warned ministers against complacency . 
State television showed him telling cabinet ministers and members of parliament that &quot; we are far from the point where we can relax in thinking that we have done our duty to the people who elected us &quot; . 
among the government &apos;s shortcomings so far , he said , were a delay in introducing a revenue-generated tax on oil products , slow approval on certain aspects of privatisation and a lack of action on reducing the overmanned civil service . 
the IMF halted credits to Romania last year after the leftist government , thrown out of office by centrists last November , overshot spending targets and slapped curbs on foreign exchange markets . 
many Romanian and Western economists have said slow reforms and overspending by the ex-communists destabilised the economy and sent Romanian living standards plunging below those of other east European countries .
