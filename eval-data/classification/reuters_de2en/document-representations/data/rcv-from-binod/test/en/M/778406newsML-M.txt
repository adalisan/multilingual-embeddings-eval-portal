the Mauritian rupee was fixed weaker against both the dollar and the pound on Tuesday , reflecting international market trends , currency dealers said . 
the rupee was quoted at a mean commercial rate of 21.7665 to the dollar from 21.7105 on Monday and at 35.5135 to the pound from 35.424 . 
dealers said the dollar had surged on international markets on speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates . 
they added that in the local market there was a dollar rush as importers forecast further strengthening of the U.S. currency . 
&quot; The fact that demand for dollars exceeds supply in the local market , coupled with international factors , made the rupee weaker , &quot; one dealer said . 
Forex dealers said the central bank was seen selling dollars in the interbank forex market on Monday afternoon at a price above the prevailing interbank rate .
