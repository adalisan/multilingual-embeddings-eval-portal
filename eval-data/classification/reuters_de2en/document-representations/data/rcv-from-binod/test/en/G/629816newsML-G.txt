beleaguered Australian captain Mark Taylor received a vote of confidence from coach Geoff Marsh on Monday just three days before the first ashes test against England . 
Taylor , who has not scored a test half-century since 1995 , was dismissed for 63 against Derbyshire on Monday in his final innings before the Edgbaston match . 
&quot; We &apos;ll sit down after this game with the three selectors and pick the best side to win the test match and I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be there , &quot; Marsh said . 
former Australian captains Ian and Greg Chappell have both called for Taylor &apos;s dismissal in favour of vice-captain Steve Waugh . 
marsh , Taylor and Waugh are the tour selectors .
