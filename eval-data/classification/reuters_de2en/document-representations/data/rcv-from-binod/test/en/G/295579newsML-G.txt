Wellington , Jan 10 - The music will play on , but there &apos;ll be no quips about individual players at Tuesday &apos;s Shell Cup cricket final at the Basin Reserve , NZPA reports . 
Wellington Cricket Association executive director Rodney Moore said some opposition batsmen could expect to stride out to specially chosen music . 
but there would be no personal comments . 
Central Districts cricketer Mark Greatbatch was furious about comments by Basin Reserve master of ceremonies Martin Devlin on New Year &apos;s Day . 
as Greatbatch walked out to bat , Devlin said the kiwi vice-captain had struggled to score runs this season , then played the tune from Mission Impossible . 
Moore could not give more details about Tuesday &apos;s entertainment programme . 
however , players in the Wellington team have chosen a piece of music to accompany them to the pitch -- such as Last Post for No 11 batsman Glenn Jonas . 
opponents &apos; music had been selected for them . 
&quot; What we &apos;ve done with the opposing teams is not intended to be offensive or denigrating in any way , &quot; said Moore . 
selecting an appropriate piece of music for some visiting batsmen -- such as the theme music from Dr Who for Auckland captain Justin Vaughan -- was done in good humour , he said .
