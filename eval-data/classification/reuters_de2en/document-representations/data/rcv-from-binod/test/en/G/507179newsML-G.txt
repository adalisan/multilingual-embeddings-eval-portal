Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged heavy fire and mortar shelling across their border in the troubled Kashmir region for the sixth day on Monday , an Indian defence official said . 
Pakistani troops have fired on the mountainous Kargil region continuously since last Wednesday , the official told Reuters . 
Kargil is 220 km ( 150 miles ) southwest of Srinagar , the summer capital of India &apos;s Jammu and Kashmir state . 
India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 over Jammu and Kashmir , two-thirds of which is in India . 
Islambad rules the rest . 
two Kargil residents , one of them a child , were killed and nine were seriously wounded in the shelling on Friday . 
at least 15,000 people had fled their homes in the town , the defence official said . 
they were being lodged in houses and tents in nearby villages where civil administrators provided them rations , medicines and kerosene oil . 
Pakistani defence officials told Reuters in Islamabad last week that nothing unusual had happened and that exchanges of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops were routine across the border in the Himalayan region . 
but Indian defence officials said the situation had taken a serious turn from last week due to the death of civilians . 
&quot; The panic is more on account of civilians dying than anything else , &quot; said a defence official who asked not to be identified . 
chief Minister Farooq Abdullah said others in Kargil town and adjacent areas had been evacuated to safer villages at least 35 km ( 22 miles ) away . 
&quot; We never initiated the shelling of mortars from this side , it is the Pakistani troops who pounded our villages and towns in Kargil sector , &quot; said Abdullah , who plans to visit the area later this week to take stock of the situation . 
the &quot; working &quot; border between India and Pakistan stretches 174 km ( 109 miles ) between the Chenab and Ravi rivers to join up in the north with the Line of Control , or ceasefire line , dividing Kashmir .
