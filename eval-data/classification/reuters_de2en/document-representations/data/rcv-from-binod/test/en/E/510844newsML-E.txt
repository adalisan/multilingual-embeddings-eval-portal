the former Soviet bloc &apos;s most successful economies told the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) on Tuesday that they were still not ready to be weaned from its assistance . 
Western countries have begun suggesting that the EBRD , set up in 1991 to aid the transition from communism to free-market economies , should scale down its work in Hungary , Poland , the Czech Republic and Slovakia and let them stand increasingly on their own feet . 
but Polish and Hungarian representatives told the EBRD &apos;s annual meeting in London that they still needed its backing . 
&quot; Even in the most advanced countries in transition , there is still a great demand for the Bank &apos;s financing in areas where it can be additional , having significant transition impact and meeting sound banking criteria , &quot; Polish National Bank Governor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said . 
&quot; Despite our progress in the market transition , the EBRD still has room to expand in Poland . 
some western officials and bankers argue that it is anachronistic for countries on the threshold of joining the European Union , some of which enjoy higher bank credit ratings than existing EU members , to receive EBRD backing . 
they want the bank to focus more on much poorer countries further east , especially in the former Soviet Union . 
but Tibor Draskovics , state secretary in the Hungarian finance ministry , said the leading reform states still faced demanding economic adjustments as they prepared for membership of the EU and other international bodies . 
&quot; We will have to implement further tough changes that other countries , which do not aspire to join these institutions , will not have to face in the coming years , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Hungary expects further support from the EBRD during this challenging new phase ... There are still sectors of our economy in need of both institutional support and long-term funding -- goods that the EBRD can deliver . 
Slovenia also entered the fray , calling on the Bank to perform a &quot; more pro-active role &quot; in preparing it and other countries for EU membership . 
Western countries and top EBRD officials have generally adopted a tougher tone with former communist countries at this year &apos;s annual meeting ending on Tuesday . 
they called for tougher action to stamp out corruption and crime and to improve the transparency and regulation of financial markets . 
Australian representative Neal Blewett said the most successful former communist countries were those which had undertaken the most vigorous reforms . 
warning against &quot; reform fatigue , &quot; he said the EBRD should concentrate on countries most committed to reform and where its support would make most difference . 
&quot; The scope for the Bank &apos;s involvement to be effective would appear to be greater in those countries that are in the intermediate or early stages of transition , &quot; he said .
