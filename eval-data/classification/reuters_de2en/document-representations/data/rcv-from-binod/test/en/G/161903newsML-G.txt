the United Arab Emirates launched a two-week anti-divorce campaign on Saturday to curb the rising number of failed marriages , local newspapers said . 
over the last few years , 36 in every 100 marriages ended in divorce , compared with 10 divorces in every 100 marriages in the 1980s , according to a recent study by the Labour and Social Affairs Development Ministry , they added . 
family interference , mixed marriages , infertility , financial problems and &quot; the wife &apos;s disobedience &quot; were cited as reasons for divorce in the oil-rich Gulf Arab state . 
Dubai police chief Major-General Dhahi Khalfan Tamim told reporters on Friday that divorce was rare in the past because the conservative Moslem society shunned it as shameful . 
&quot; But today , it ( the marriage certificate ) is regarded as a piece if paper with no obligation on either party , &quot; the English-language Gulf News quoted quoted him as saying . 
&quot; Recent statistics have shown that the increase in divorce is threatening social stability and security , &quot; he added . 
&quot; It was dreadful to learn that of every 100 marriages , 36 ended in divorce &quot; , Tamim added . 
in the last few years , one in every four marriages among UAE national ended in divorce . 
the campaign will use television and newspapers to focus on the causes of divorce and its effects on children .
