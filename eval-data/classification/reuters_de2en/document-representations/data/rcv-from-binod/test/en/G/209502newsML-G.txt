a compromise mediated by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to defuse the political crisis in Belarus ran into immediate trouble on Friday when parliamentary deputies attacked it as a sellout . 
Chernomyrdin hammered out the deal in 10 hours of overnight talks involving hardline President Alexander Lukashenko and parliament chairman Semyon Sharetsky , spokesman for the opposition to the president &apos;s proposed extension of his powers . 
in the accord , signed as dawn broke over the capital Minsk , Lukashenko agreed that a referendum on Sunday on his proposed constitutional changes will not be legally binding . 
Parliament , which by confronting the president stirred memories of Russian President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s violent showdown with his own legislators in 1993 , dropped impeachment moves against Lukashenko . 
but a few hours later angry deputies attacked the deal as a betrayal . 
tempers rose in the parliament chamber and one pro-Lukashenko deputy tried to grab the microphone as opponents of the president denounced Sharetsky for signing the deal . 
Sergei Kalyakin , head of the communist group , said the agreement suited nobody 100 per cent and would have to win the approval of two thirds of parliament to be valid . 
&quot; We have only gone half way . 
in fact there is no agreement , &quot; he said . 
social democrat deputy Pavel Znavets said parliament should press on with its bid to remove Lukashenko from office : &quot; We must declare impeachment . 
God has given us one last chance . 
&quot; We got nothing from Lukashenko , &quot; complained liberal deputy Lyudmila Gryaznova . 
Sharetsky sat silent and exhausted and finally adjourned the session until an expected visit to parliament by the president later in the day . 
earlier Chernomyrdin hailed the deal as an end to conflict and made clear the negotiations had been very difficult : &quot; I have not been involved in such an undertaking for 15 years . 
in Moscow , the Kremlin trumpeted it as a political masterstroke . 
&quot; This is a huge success , a genuine breakthrough in the search for a way out of the constitutional crisis in Belarus , &quot; spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing . 
Russian analyst Arkady Moshes , at Moscow &apos;s Institute of Europe , said the economic pressure Russia can bring to bear on Belarus may have been a key factor in the deal . 
&quot; Lukashenko has nowhere to turn . 
his prospects would be pretty short-lived if he antagonised Russia , &quot; he said . 
further proof of Moscow &apos;s powerful leverage over Lukashenko came on Friday when his chief aide Vladimir Zametalin told Reuters that Belarus had completed the handover of its former Soviet nuclear missiles to Russia . 
the handover of the last batch of 16 missiles was due by the end of 1996 , but Lukashenko suggested this month that it be delayed in order to extract a promise from NATO that it would not deploy nuclear missiles on the territory of new member states such as Poland . 
Moscow quickly vetoed the idea . 
parliamentarians had already offered their main concession -- dropping the impeachment proceedings -- earlier in the week . 
but Lukashenko , confident of popular support in Sunday &apos;s voting , had refused point blank to make terms and threatened to dissolve parliament and the constitutional court . 
Chernomyrdin said that a political treaty signed between Russia and Belarus last April meant that Moscow felt closely connected to the fate of its neighbour . 
under the terms of the deal a constitutional committee withe 50 representatives each of parliament and of the president will draw up a new constitution over the next three months . 
&quot; The committee will be headed by the president . 
the committee must over three months accept a new constitution on the basis of whatever draft is accepted by a majority in the referendum , &quot; the moustachioed Lukashenko said . 
but Viktor Gonchar , sacked by the president last week as head of the central electoral commission , told Reuters : &quot; This document is just a cover for unlawful actions by Lukashenko . 
&quot; It &apos;s clear Lukashenko will definitely have a majority in the constitutional assembly , &quot; he added , describing the accord as a betrayal .
