President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday discussed ways to generate Middle East peace momentum out of Israel &apos;s withdrawal of troops from Hebron . 
seated in the Oval Office , Clinton and Netanyahu held their first meeting since Israel handed over most of West Bank Hebron to Palestinian rule in January . 
they were to have a working lunch and conclude their visit with a news conference . 
Clinton , in brief remarks to reporters , applauded Netanyahu &apos;s &quot; terrific effort &quot; in concluding the Hebron deal with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and added : &quot; I &apos;m looking forward to the next steps . 
Netanyahu applauded the &quot; decisive &quot; role Clinton and his diplomatic staff played in prodding the deal along . 
&quot; It &apos;s time that we see such steps from our partners as well . 
and if we have this mutuality we will have I think a great future , a different future of hope for our children and our grandchilren . 
he was apparently referring to Syria , seen as the missing cornerstone to an overall Middle East peace . 
Israeli-Syrian negotiations have long been stuck over the fate of the strategic Golan Heights , captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war . 
Damascus wants the heights back , Israel says no . 
a potential sore point in the three-hour meeting between the U.S. and Israeli leaders was Netanyahu &apos;s concern about a possible sale of U.S. F-16 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia . 
the Israeli news agency Itim quoted Netanyahu as telling reporters aboard his plane that Israel would view such a sale &quot; with severity . 
asked White House reaction , spokesman Mike McCurry said : &quot; Well , I &apos;m not sure what the potentiality of that sale is at this point . 
but regional arms balance issues are routinely on the agenda that we have with the government of Israel . 
Netanyahu is the first in a parade of Middle East leaders scheduled to visit Washington over the next several weeks . 
he will be followed by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan . 
he began his day at breakfast with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , their first meeting since she discovered she is of Jewish ancestry through investigative news articles into her family &apos;s wartime background in Czechoslovakia . 
the prime minister was also meeting new Defence Secretary William Cohen during his two-day Washington stay . 
he spends Saturday , the Jewish Sabbath , in New York before flying home . 
Netanyahu will also meet leaders of Congress , which gave him a standing ovation on his first post-election visit last year and gives Israel $ 3 billion a year in aid , the highest sum given any country . 
he and Clinton , joined by Arafat and King Hussein , last met in October after violence over Israel &apos;s opening of a new entrance to a Jerusalem tourist tunnel near a Moslem shrine threatened to overwhelm the Middle East peace process . 
since then Israel has given most of Hebron &apos;s Palestinians self-rule , agreed to free Palestinian prisoners and set three deadlines for pulling troops out of West Bank rural areas .
