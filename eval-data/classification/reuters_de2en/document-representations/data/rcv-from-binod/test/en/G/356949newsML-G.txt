seven dangerous inmates escaped from a jail by digging a 36-foot ( 12 meter ) tunnel , the prison director said on Wednesday . 
the breakout was discovered late on Tuesday in the sultry industrial city of San Pedro sula , 100 miles ( 165 km ) north of the capital city . 
the jail holds 1,500 convicts . 
local press dubbed the escape the most spectacular in Honduran history . 
authorities ordered a national alert to capture the fugitives and keep them from leaving the country . 
&quot; There are seven convicts on the run . 
they dug a 12-meter tunnel from a carpentry workshop to beyond the outer wall , &quot; director Juan Paz said . 
he said the fugitives , including murderers , drug traffickers and bank robbers , dug the tunnel over a period of weeks using tools from the workshop . 
an investigation is under way to find out how they could have dug the tunnel for so long without being caught , he said .
