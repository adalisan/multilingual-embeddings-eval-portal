German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said on Thursday the Bundesbank &apos;s gold reserves should be revalued at close to the market level but stressed the central bank would not sell off any of its bullion . 
&quot; Germany will not sell one ounce of gold , &quot; he told a news conference . 
he was speaking on a hectic day when he learned his 1997 budget would have 18 billion marks ( $ 10.6 billion ) less in tax revenues that he had originally expected . 
Waigel , who dashed from Bonn to Frankfurt by helicopter to discuss revaluing the gold with the Bundesbank , said Germany &apos;s record unemployment -- one of the main drags on his budget -- would average 4.3 million this year . 
additional outlays for unemployment could cost the government up to 20 billion marks , he added . 
but he repeated , as he had done all day , that Germany would still meet the deficit target this year for joining the single European currency . 
the Maastricht treaty sets a budget deficit ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) for states wanting to join economic and monetary union ( EMU ) , which is due for launch in 1999 . 
Waigel said that changes to the Bundesbank law needed to allow the revaluation would be passed before the parliamentary summer break . 
gold is valued at an average of 144 marks per ounce in the Bundesbank balance sheet , well below the market price of around 600 marks . 
a revaluation of the gold held at the central bank would give the Bundesbank -- and thus Bonn -- windfall profits of about 40 billion marks if current market prices were adopted . 
but analysts say a new book price between the current book level and the current market level is a likely option . 
Bonn , desperate to qualify fairly and squarely for EMU , is seeking ways to trim its budget deficit to the three percent Maastricht target . 
it was not immediately clear how the Bundesbank profit could be used to help Germany to qualify for EMU , as such one-off gains cannot be used to reduce deficits under EU rules . 
Waigel also told the news conference that the ruling coalition planned to discuss further budget measures but he gave no details . 
economists said Waigel &apos;s frantic search for extra funds looked like the &quot; creative accounting &quot; he and the Bundesbank have long criticised in other European countries . 
&quot; If Waigel wants to change the rules of the Bundesbank because of EMU , that looks like trickery , &quot; said Bronwyn Curtis , chief economist at Nomura in London . 
Deutsche Bank analyst Hans-Juergen Meltzer said : &quot; If Germany now tries to meet the EMU criteria with the Bundesbank &apos;s help , this will weaken the position of all the Europeans who are trying to keep Italy out of the EMU because on the grounds that its finances are shaky .
