the Romanian central bank &apos;s foreign exchange reserves rose to between $ 1.55 and $ 1.6 billion in May from $ 1.45 billion last month and should hit over $ 2 billion in June , the bank &apos;s governor said on Wednesday . 
the levels announced by governor Mugur Isarescu are the highest since the 1989 fall of communism . 
&quot; I estimate Romania &apos;s foreign reserves now stand at around $ 1.55 to $ 1.6 billion , &quot; Isarescu told reporters at the end of a banking seminar . 
&quot; One week ago , they were $ 1.5 billion . 
he said the rise was triggered by capital inflows , purchases of dollars from the local interbank market and by direct foreign investments and repatriation of export earnings . 
&quot; Some $ 250 million came from savings from people who took the dollars from under their matresses and sold them to currency shops , &quot; Isarescu said . 
late last month , the International Monetary Fund released the first tranche of about $ 86 million of a 13-month $ 430 million stand-by accord for Romania . 
Isarescu said further IMF tranches , purchases from the local market and a pending bond issue by Romania &apos;s Finance Ministry for around 700 million marks could push the BNR &apos;s reserves beyond $ 2 billion in June . 
&quot; It is possible that in June , with the bonds issued by the Finance Ministry , the total could exceed $ 2 billion , but this is only a forecast , &quot; he said . 
the central bank ( BNR ) has bought large amounts of dollars over the past two months to prevent the leu from firming . 
money market and commercial bank interest rates were pushed up earlier in the year in line with tougher policy to control inflation but have since fallen . 
the leu has been trading in a relatively stable range near 7,050 to the dollar this month after recovering from a record low of 9,000 in mid-February . 
latest data show foreign reserve assets in the banking system stood at $ 2.88 billion in March . 
these assets include gold reserves of about 90 tonnes , Special Drawing Rights and hard currency reserves of local banks and the BNR .
