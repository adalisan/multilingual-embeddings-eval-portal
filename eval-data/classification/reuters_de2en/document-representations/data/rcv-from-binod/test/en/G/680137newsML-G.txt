a British veteran vowed on Monday to fight a court battle against the Japanese government to seek a formal apology and cash compensation for Japan &apos;s treatment of prisoners during World War Two . 
I didn &apos;t like it , &quot; Arthur Titherington , secretary of the Japanese Labour Camp Survivors &apos; Association , said . 
&quot; I will not surrender again , &quot; he told a news conference in Tokyo . 
Titherington was representing some 10,000 British prisoners of war at a Tokyo district court . 
the former POWs are demanding that the Japanese government make an unequivocal apology and pay each $ 22,000 in cash compensation . 
&quot; There is no hatred . 
there is no question of revenge . 
it is simply a matter of justice , &quot; the 75-year-old veteran said . 
Titherington accused the Japanese government of &quot; sitting back and waiting for a natural solution to the problem &quot; . 
&quot; The natural solution being the death of people like me , &quot; he said . 
more than 12,000 Britons died from disease and starvation in Japanese war camps or in work gangs . 
&quot; Because of the procrastination of your government , you the ordinary Japanese are invariably refered to , certainly in Britain , with derogatory names , usually the bloody Japanese , &quot; Titherington said . 
&quot; Very seldom are you referred to as the Japanese , &quot; he said . 
&quot; You are held responsible for something you didn &apos;t do , &quot; he said .
