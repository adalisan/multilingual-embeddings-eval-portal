the Swiss Federal Office for Economic Policy will report on Tuesday that third-quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) fell by 0.7 percent after a provisional 0.9 percent second-quarter drop , banking sources said . 
the data are due for official release only next week , but the office , a division of the economics ministry , routinely circulates them under embargo to bank economists and economic institutes ahead of publication , the sources said . 
&quot; This has been going on for years , &quot; one source said . 
the numbers are provided in advance to allow the banks and institutes to prepare analysis and analytical commentary ahead of the announced released date , the sources said . 
this time they found their way into the markets , but have had no major impact . 
an economics office official confirmed that the data has for some time been circulated in such a manner to allow economists more time to analyse the data . 
&quot; I can confirm this , &quot; said Andre Schwaller of the Office for Economic Policy . 
&quot; It is handled in such a way that certain circles and people get this information in advance , the Centre for Research of Economic Activity as well , &quot; he said . 
he was referring to the KOF economic think tank , one of Switzerland &apos;s top forecasting institutes . 
he could not say whether people informed in advance were able to profit from their knowledge , adding : &quot; Not as such because all banks are treated in the same way . 
in this regard , no one is better off than the others . 
all banks operating here would be included in this system , and not just Swiss banks , he said . 
&quot; Swiss banks are not given preference , &quot; he added . 
he said the system aims to give institutions the chance to keep publications that require weeks of preparation up to date . 
&quot; The people who look after these publications are supposed to keep the data to themselves , but I can now see it is apparent this information is going in different directions and I suspect we will have to consider how this is handled , Schwaller said . 
he said his office had not encountered any problems in the past . 
&quot; This is apparently the first time a problem has arisen . 
someone has not stuck to the rules of the game . 
the Swiss system complies with guidelines drawn up by the International Monetary Fund and posted on the Internet on the Dissimination Standards Bulletin Board . 
the Web site ( http : / / DSBB.IMF.ORG ) opened in April 1996 to guide members that wish to access capital markets . 
&quot; Data are made available under strict conditions , to the Minister of Economy , the Minister of Finance , the Governor of the National Bank , the Swiss Council of Economic Advisers ( KFK ) and national forecasting institutions ( including reserach divisions of accredited banks ) some days ahead of press release , &quot; it says on the page . 
&quot; Data are provided to the press and to the interested public on an embargo basis by postal mailing the day before and by fax the day of release , &quot; it adds .
