rival forces clashed in northwest Cambodia early on Saturday and international human rights group Amnesty International expressed grave fears for the safety of hundreds of supporters of the country &apos;s ousted co-premier . 
residents in Siem Reap , 250 km ( 150 miles ) northwest of Phnom Penh , said there was shelling in an area west of the town although the town itself , under the control of forces loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen , remained quiet . 
forces loyal to ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh have been attacking Hun Sen &apos;s troops in the area in an attempt to cut the town off , military officials loyal to Hun Sen said . 
residents of Siem Reap , near the famed Angkor Wat temple complex , said the shelling began about an hour after dawn and lasted some 20 minutes . 
there were no reports of casualties and military officials in the area were not immediately available for comment . 
in a letter obtained by Reuters on Saturday , London-based Amnesty International expressed serious concerns about the fate of hundreds of soldiers and officials of Ranariddh &apos;s royalist FUNCINPEC party believed to have been captured by Hun Sen &apos;s forces . 
&quot; We hold grave fears for the safety of the hundreds of FUNCINPEC soldiers and officials believed to be in the custody of your forces , &quot; Amnesty secretary general Pierre sane said in an open letter to Hun Sen. 
Amnesty said it was deeply concerned for the safety of politicians , journalists and activists linked to FUNCINPEC and two smaller parties allied to the royalists . 
&quot; We urge you to clarify immediately and publicly the status and welfare of all those being held , provide guarantees for their safety and fair treatment and afford access to them by independent monitors , &quot; sane said . 
sane also condemned the reported summary execution of officials from Ranariddh &apos;s royalist FUNCINPEC party . 
Hun Sen &apos;s officials confirmed the arrest and subsequent execution of senior FUNCINPEC member Ho Sok , a secretary of state at the interior ministry . 
Hun Sen later said he regretted Ho Sok &apos;s death and said he had ordered and an investigation to find out who was responsible . 
a newspaper which supports Hun Sen later reported the suicide of FUNCINPEC intelligence officer , Chao Sambath , although government officials have not confirmed his death . 
Ho Sok and Chao Sambath were among four senior royalists who Hun Sen said were responsible for last week &apos;s fighting in Phnom Penh which left at least 58 dead and up to 200 wounded . 
in an apparent reference to the brutality of Cambodia &apos;s &quot; killing fields &quot; regime , Amnesty &apos;s sane urged Hun Sen to halt alleged human rights abuses . 
&quot; You know only too well the spectre of gross human rights violations that haunts Cambodia to this day , &quot; he said . 
more than one million Cambodians died under the brutal Maoist Khmer Rouge rule from 1975 to 1979 . 
the other two royalists identified by Hun Sen were Ranariddh &apos;s top military man , General Nhiek Bun Chhay , and the prince &apos;s chief security officer , Serey Kosal . 
general Nhiek Bun Chhay fled from Phnom Penh as Hun Sen &apos;s forces took control of the city and its outskirts on Sunday . 
his whereabouts were not known but there have been rumours he was captured by Hun Sen &apos;s troops . 
Serey Kosal is believed to have fled to northwestern Cambodia .
