the UK &apos;s FTSE 100 index closed the week at record highs as lower-than-expected U.S. price data allayed worries about a possible U.S. rates rise and investors looked ahead to more favourable earnings reports next week . 
the FTSE closed Friday &apos;s session at 3,967.9 points , up 35.3 points on the day and just off the all-time high of 3,970.5 set mid-afternoon as U.S. treasuries soared on a weaker-than-forecast 0.1 percent rise in U.S. consumer prices in August . 
&quot; The figure wiped out the last of the worries about rates . 
either it means the Fed will raise by only 25 basis points , which most have discounted , or not at all , &quot; said one trader . 
the market had been capped this week by worries the September 24 meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting might result in a monetary tightening . 
&quot; A fortnight ago everyone was worried that interest rates would go up in excess of a quarter point , now there &apos;s a chance that there will be no rise this time around and the FTSE is looking to go to 4,000 points , &quot; a second dealer said . 
strategists and dealers agreed the 4,000 point barrier would fall early next week and said investors , taking heart from favourable earnings reports from UK companies this week , were looking for more confirmation of solid corporate performances . 
dealers said interest was spread broadly in moderate volume of just over 580 million shares . 
&quot; It looks dramatic ... but activity has been quite modest . 
most business has been in British Telecom , BTR and Hanson , &quot; said one dealer , who said a slight retracement was possible on Monday before the market resumed its climb . 
strategists warned the market could level out . 
&quot; We should see 4,000 points next week but levels significantly above that could be hard to maintain . 
we are approaching fully-valued levels . 
&quot; said Richard Jeffrey , strategist at Charterhouse Tilney . 
with U.S. rate worries dwindling , analysts said investors would continue to focus on company results , after upbeat half-year reports this week from Kingfisher , BTR , British Aerospace , Legal and General and Williams Holdings . 
players will also keep a weather eye on Wednesday &apos;s UK retail sales and Tuesday &apos;s UK public sector borrowing requirement data , although analysts said those figures , and Thursday &apos;s money supply news , should prove uncontroversial . 
a statement on monthly trends for September from the Confederation of British Industry next Friday could , however , prove more decisive . 
on Friday , British Telecom headed volume , gaining 8-1 / 2p to close at 831p . 
other major movers included BTR , up 1-1 / 2p at 274p , and Railtrack , which gained three pence to 287-1 / 2p on follow-through after a wave of U.S. interest , traders said .
