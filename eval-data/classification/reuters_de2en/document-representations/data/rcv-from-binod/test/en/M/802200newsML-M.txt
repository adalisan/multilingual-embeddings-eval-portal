the Mexican bourse shrugged off some its early lethargy in early afternoon trading on Friday after television network TV Azteca went public with the largest initial offering of Mexican stock in recent years . 
Azteca CPO shares were trading at 36.95 pesos , or 1.52 above their floatation price , but were off an early high of 38.20 . 
&quot; You know the way it goes -- pushing and shoving to buy at first , then they all lower their bids , &quot; a floor trader said . 
the leading IPC share index was down 20.54 points , or 0.41 percent , at 4,994.07 . 
&quot; It was the event of the day . 
the word is it &apos;s a good long-term buy , but maybe not so good for day-trippers ; the stock ( TV Azteca ) may not be so liquid , &quot; the trader added . 
dealers recalled Azteca went public just before midday with a star-studded celebration in the stock exchange . 
&quot; ( Company President ) Ricardo Salinas Pliego was here ... ( interviewer ) and ( anchorman ) Javier Alatorre was reporting upstairs . 
all the spit and polish , &quot; another dealer said . 
dealers noted that dealing was unusually slow , aside from the Azteca IPO , amid market caution over a sharp slide on Wall Street and the runup to the August 19 Fed meeting . 
&quot; Just look at the volume . 
if you take away the two cross trades to float Azteca , it &apos;s really very shameful , &quot; a desk trader said . 
trading volume was dead slow at 35.9 million shares . 
two cross trades in TV Azteca accounted for some 23 million of the total . 
on the broad market , decliners outnumbered gainers by 43 to 33 , out of 96 stocks that had changed hands .
