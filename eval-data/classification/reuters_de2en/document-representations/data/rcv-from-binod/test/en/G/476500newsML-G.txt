Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on Monday described a planned union between Russia and Belarus as &quot; nonsense &quot; that could ruin the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) , the grouping of 12 former Soviet republics . 
&quot; If there is unification it will be completely mechanical because the speeds of development of Russia and Belarus are absolutely different as are the opinions of the leaderships , &quot; Kuchma told a news conference . 
Kuchma was referring to plans by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko to sign a bilateral Union Treaty in Moscow on Wednesday . 
this is a way to the destruction of the CIS , &quot; he said . 
Yeltsin on Monday approved the draft of the treaty despite liberals &apos; fears that he might be signing away some of his powers to authoritarian Lukashenko . 
Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov , who co-authored the draft , later dismissed such fears as groundless . 
Ukraine , whose referendum on independence in December 1991 heralded the end of the Soviet Union , is generally sceptical about the re-integration of ex-Soviet states and aims for integration with European structures . 
Kuchma was the first foreign leader to meet Lukashenko after a controversial constitutional referendum in Belarus last November which gave the Minsk leader sweeping powers . 
the Ukrainian leader , usually hesitant to criticise Lukashenko , said he did not support some of the Belarus leader &apos;s actions such as his recent crackdowns on the mass media . 
Belarussian authorities have recently warned foreign correspondents that they would have their licences to report withdrawn if they showed bias . 
one Russian television correspondent had his accreditation withdrawn and was ordered to leave Belarus by March 31 . 
Kuchma also praised a CIS summit in Moscow last week as the first one to take Kiev &apos;s interests into account . 
&quot; It was the first attempt to show the CIS consists of equal partners . 
before , issues were often considered only from Russia &apos;s point of view , &quot; Kuchma said . 
Kuchma , who met Yeltsin on Saturday after the CIS summit , confirmed the Kremlin leader would visit Kiev , a trip that has been postponed at least six times . 
but he added that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would come to Kiev before Yeltsin to discuss economic issues . 
&quot; Relations between the two governments have been stopped and this was a tragedy for Ukraine , &quot; Kuchma said . 
Ukraine holds observer status in the CIS , despite being one of its co-founders .
