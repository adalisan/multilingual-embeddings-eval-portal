a 19-year-old man was shot and seriously injured in Northern Ireland late on Wednesday , shortly after an explosion was heard outside a police station . 
police said details about the incident were sketchy and they could not confirm reports of a bomb . 
they said a hostile crowd had gathered at the scene , a police station in Coalisland , County Tyrone . 
local people said they suspected the explosion , heard shortly before 1000 p.m. ( 2200 GMT ) , was caused by a stun grenade fired by security forces . 
councillor Jim canning said he was at a function nearby in the town . 
&quot; There was an explosion followed by a number of gunshots . 
some of us went outside and there was a man lying on the ground surrounded by a number of men who appeared to be some form of undercover operation , &quot; canning said . 
he said the man had his hands tied behind his back and the &quot; undercover &quot; people appeared agitated . 
&quot; They were concerned about the crowd that was gathering and they were shouting at the crowd to stand back and eventually plastic bullets were fired , &quot; he told reporters . 
hospital sources said the man was admitted with gunshot wounds to the stomach and was in a &quot; serious but stable &quot; condition . 
two women also suffered minor injuries in the melee around the police station , they said . 
the incident came hours after two suspected IRA bombs exploded in north west England , damaging railway lines and signalling equipment . 
earlier the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) said it would not relax its guerrilla war to end British rule of Northern Ireland and blamed Britain for the lack of progress in peace efforts for the province . 
&quot; Everyone should be assured that we are united , we are strong and we remain steadfast in our determination to achieve our objectives , &quot; the IRA said in a statement .
