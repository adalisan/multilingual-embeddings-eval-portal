trade on the European Options Exchange ( EOE ) on Thursday was heavily dominated by interest in the AEX contract itself as market makers were forced by a rising index to buy back their positions . 
dealers said market-makers had sold calls on the index , believing it would remain below 620 points but year-end position squaring by some large institutional investors has now forced their hands and they added the game may not be over yet . 
December options expire on Friday and dealers said the index could be squeezed higher by option-holders . 
the AEX was trading around 624 points on Thursday , five points above the close . 
some dealers said the index could rise by another four or five points tomorrow ahead of the expiry . 
the EOE contract captured more than 30 percent of total trade on Thursday , with nearly 30,000 changing hands .
