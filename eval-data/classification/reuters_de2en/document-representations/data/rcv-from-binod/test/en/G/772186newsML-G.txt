Russian pianist Svyatoslav Richter , one of the greatest musicians of the age , died of a heart attack in a Moscow hospital on Friday . 
he was 82 . 
&quot; To lose a man like this is terrible . 
for us he was a poet , a painter , everything , &quot; Lilian Hochhauser , Richter &apos;s London agent for over 35 years , told Reuters by telephone . 
&quot; But the recordings will live . 
Richter , born of ethnic German stock in Zhitomir near Kiev in 1915 , had lived in Paris and Germany in recent years . 
he had been in poor health since a heart bypass operation 2 1 / 2 years ago and had not performed in public for some years . 
he returned to Moscow with his wife Nina Dorliak about a month ago . 
Itar-Tass news agency said he had continued playing for several hours a day but was rushed into the elite Central Clinical Hospital on Thursday . 
his father , a pianist and composer , gave him his first music lessons and by 1933 was accompanying opera -- his first love -- in the Black Sea city of Odessa . 
he composed from the age of eight but stopped at 20 . 
for 10 years from 1937 he studied at the Moscow conservatory and by the 1950s he was one of the world &apos;s top touring performers . 
he was particularly known for his interpretations of Bach and of his great Russian contemporary Dmitry Shostakovich . 
Stylistically , he said he was influenced by modernist abstract painters like Piet Mondrian . 
he also painted himself . 
his repertoire encompassed the great classics of European music , including his fellow Russian and friend Sergei Prokofiev . 
apart from his solo work he played chamber music with distinguished friends including the late Soviet violinist David Oistrakh and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich . 
he cut an aloof figure in public and in his later years his rare performances were marked by some eccentricities . 
Hochhauser said : &quot; He hated studio recording . 
&quot; But he had recordings made of nearly all his concerts , leaving a great amount of unreleased material . 
though he toured extensively and spent much of his life abroad , Richter remained loyal to the Soviet Union , unlike some artists such as Rostropovich , who left or were expelled . 
&quot; He did what he wanted . 
he came and went as he pleased , &quot; Hochhauser said . 
&quot; It was never an issue for him to defect . 
&quot; He hated the climate , the cold Russian winters , &quot; she added . 
&quot; And he generally rose above all politics . 
he left unpleasant details to Nina . 
a dislike of flying contributed to Richter seldom returning to North America after a first visit in 1960 . 
yet he travelled extensively by land and sea , even playing in Japan after a mammoth train journey during which he stopped off to play in obscure towns along the way , Hochhauser said . 
he spoke German as easily as Russian and founded France &apos;s Grange-de-Meslay festival in 1964 , returning annually to play and delight audiences with his virtuosity , dedication to perfection and above all the depth of feeling he transmitted . 
&quot; One has to bring out intact the ideas , the heart , the naked truth of the author who created this work . 
one has to meditate on it , feel it , put one &apos;s technique at the service of this old friend , &quot; Richter once said .
