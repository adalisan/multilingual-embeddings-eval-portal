a resurgence of demand from importers taking advantage of a strong Kenyan shilling weakened the currency marginally on Wednesday , commercial bank dealers said . 
the Central Bank of Kenya posted a commercial mean of 53.06 against the dollar , compared with 52.96 on Tuesday , while against the pound it was posted at a mean of 86.75 from 86.50 . 
&quot; The demand was sudden and under normal circumstances would not have moved rates , it &apos;s just that right now , the market is extremely sensitive , &quot; one dealer from a leading bank said . 
dealers said the fact the central bank had indicated it would keep out of the market and allow rates to find their levels of equilibrium had made them nervous about maintaining long dollar positions without a buyer of last resort . 
&quot; Over the last three days , we &apos;ve kept a spread of 30 cents , which shows they &apos;re slightly anxious , &quot; one dealer said . 
some dealers expressed concern that a strong shilling would hurt exporters and the shilling was overvalued at current levels . 
but a senior central bank official told Reuters the bank believed that given economic fundamentals , the shilling was still very undervalued . 
dealers said they saw any demand as an opportunity for the shilling to correct itself and retrace its steps to 54 . 
the money market remained tight with overnight rates quoted at 20 percent levels unchanged .
