Southeast Asian grain and oilseeds buyers are currently sidelined , betting that futures prices in Chicago will fall by the end of December , and domestic corn prices are already sliding , traders said on Wednesday . 
a flour mill manager in Kuala Lumpur said international corn prices are holding up due to shipment delays throughout the world caused by congestion in U.S. ports . 
&quot; Once this clears , the price will fall again , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Traders know the price will fall to 410 or 420 ( ringgit a tonne ) by the end of the month , &quot; the manager added . 
&quot; So if they buy now , they &apos;ll be looking for this price . 
bulk corn ex-factory / godown in Malaysia &apos;s central region was quoted at 445-460 ringgit a tonne this week , down sharply from 475 to 480 ringgit previously . 
corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) have been falling steadily recently with the December contract closing 1-1 / 2 U.S. cents down at $ 2.65 a bushel on Tuesday , on reports of excellent crop prospects in South America . 
another Malaysian trader said corn importers were expected to lock in orders for 1997 beginning in early January . 
&quot; Many of us are stocked until the first quarter of 1997 , or March that is , and that means we have to start ordering by January for the shipment to reach us in time , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; A &quot; grade wheat in bags , ex-factory / godown in the central region , was quoted unchanged at 800 ringgit per tonne . 
the price of low-grade wheat was markedly lower at 450 ringgit a tonne compared to 500-510 ringgit last week . 
local soymeal was also unchanged at 810 ringgit a tonne in the central region this week . 
imported soymeal was slightly lower at 790 ringgit a tonne compared to 800 ringgit previously . 
in Thailand , buyers bought a cargo or two of soymeal for December / January shipment while dealers said further purchases would hinge on the prospects for lower prices . 
one dealer said his trading house received 5,000-6,000 tonnes of buying orders for Indian-origin soymeal for December 15 to January 15 shipment at a price around $ 304 a tonne C &amp; F. 
&quot; I would expect more buying if the prices fall further , &quot; said one trader . 
some traders said , however , that short-term buying would be limited as more soymeal from oil crushers would be available in the market soon . 
about 100,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans imported by vegetable oil producers should arrive in Thai ports between late December and early January , trade and shipping sources said . 
the vessel Yick Kam , with 47,000 tonnes of soybeans , will arrive on December 5 . 
the vessel avalanche was scheduled to load 50,000 tonnes of soybeans between November 28 and December 5 and is likely to arrive in Thailand by the end of December or early January . 
domestic Thai corn prices have eased as farmers have sold more supplies to the market ahead of scheduled debt repayments to the state-run agriculture bank later this month . 
corn prices eased to 4.20-4.30 baht a kg from 4.28-4.40 baht a kg last week . 
soymeal was quoted at around 9.20 baht a kg from 9.20-9.50 baht a kg a week earlier . 
in Indonesia , corn prices continued their downtrend due to the local harvest and are expected to remain under pressure from declining chicken prices , traders said . 
they said there was some downside potential in soymeal prices due to the arrival of Indian and South American imports from next week through until January . 
corn was quoted at 380-390 rupiah a kg in Jakarta , down from 395-400 rupiah a week ago . 
soymeal was generally stable at around 800 rupiah , unchanged from last week . 
&quot; Chicken prices are on a downtrend due to probably an oversupply situation ahead of the Christmas and New Year celebrations , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; This is certainly going to add pressure to corn prices as feedmillers will have to trim production , &quot; he added . 
traders said the corn import business was quiet as feedmillers seemed to be well covered until early next year . 
one trader from Lampung , where the harvest is in its early stage , said arrivals have been steady , keeping prices soft . 
&quot; There has been some rain in Lampung but nothing heavy or long enough to damage the crops , &quot; she said . 
another trader said he expected 154,000 tonnes of Indian origin soymeal and 60,000 tonnes of South American origin meal to arrive from next week until the end of January . 
&quot; I would say the shipments are expected to keep supplies ample , &quot; he said . 
data from Tanjung Priok Port showed that the Pisces Pioneer arrived at Jakarta with 16,500 tonnes of soybeans on November 20 from the United States . 
the Multi Purpose 3 arrived on November 24 with 15,509 tonnes of soymeal from Brazil .
