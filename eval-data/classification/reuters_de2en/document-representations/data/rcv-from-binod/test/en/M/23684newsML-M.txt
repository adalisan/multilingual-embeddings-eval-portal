U.S. stock index futures ended sharply lower as end-of-month buying failed to emerge following the morning &apos;s frantic sell-off , traders said . 
&quot; I would have expected to see more of a bid come into the market , &quot; one Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 futures trader said . 
while short-covering was noted , there was little buying momentum to prod the September S &amp; P contract much above the 653.00 level for the rest of the afternoon . 
&quot; You would have thought there would be a little bit of dough being put to work here , &quot; another S &amp; P floor source said as September languished around 652.00 . 
however , Jay Hohmann , head of stock index futures at Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities , said chart patterns suggest cash S &amp; P 500s will test and surpass their highs . 
&quot; The Dow Industrials going to 6,000 by the end of the year is not impossible . 
Hohmann said the low 650.00 handle in cash S &amp; Ps represented a pivot point , but that the index could drop to 640.00 and still manage to rebound . 
&quot; This is the zone where the market went steaming through , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There is a level of support here . 
one futures trader pegged support for September at 648.00 , and said a violation of that level could lead the contract to the low 640.00s. 
the August National Association of Purchasing Management index for the Chicago region rose to 60.0 , from 51.2 in July . 
the increase was the largest monthly rise since December 1993 , and the highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 . 
the report , coupled with an increase in July U.S. factory orders and in the University of Michigan &apos;s consumer sentiment survey , pressured U.S. stocks lower . 
the data suggested that inflationary pressures may start creeping up in the U.S. economy in the third quarter , thereby disproving forecasts of a U.S. economic slowdown sometime in the year . 
fair value for September was at 0.95 point to cash . 
arbitrage buy programs were noted in the first two hours of trade at about 1.30 points over cash . 
arbitrage sell programs were reportedly 0.20 under . 
U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for the U.S. Labor Day holiday . 
at the end of pit trade , September S &amp; Ps were off 5.80 at 651.35 , NYSE New composites off 2.20 at 350.95 , KBT Value Lines off 1.60 at 616.70 , Nikkeis down 325 at 20,185 , midcaps off 0.20 at 232.45 and Nasdaqs off 6.80 at 665.40 .
