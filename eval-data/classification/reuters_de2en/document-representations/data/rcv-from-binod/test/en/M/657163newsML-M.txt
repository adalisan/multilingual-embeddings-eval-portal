call rates rose to 9.00-9.75 percent in latest quotes . 
a strike by a section of the staff of State Bank of India ( SBI ) , leading lender , in Bombay , led to other lenders quoting rates higher than 9.0 percent , dealers said . 
&quot; There is no need to panic about SBI &apos;s absence as most of the lending institutions and banks are holding excess funds , &quot; a dealer said .
