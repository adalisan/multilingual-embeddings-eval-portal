Orange County , Calif . , said on Wednesday it does not plan to increase the tender premiums for its taxable pension obligation bonds Series 1994A . 
recent market developments should make the tender prices more attractive to bondholders , county finance officials said . 
last month , the county Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution authorizing the tender offer of the county &apos;s taxable refunding pension obligation bonds . 
the proposal calls for the county to sell up to $ 200 million of debt to refund the outstanding bonds .
