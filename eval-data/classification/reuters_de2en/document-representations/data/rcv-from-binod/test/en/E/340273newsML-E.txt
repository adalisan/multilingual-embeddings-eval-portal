foreign investment in South Africa is growing at a healthy rate and is one of the key forces contributing to the country &apos;s economic growth , Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said . 
Erwin told Reuters that investment was increasing and was spread across the economy , unlike in the 1980s and early 1990s . 
&quot; The level of investment in South Africa is growing at a very healthy rate . 
&quot; It is one of the key driving forces in the growth process at present and we are very pleased with that , &quot; Erwin said in an interview late on Tuesday . 
inward investment jumped to 3.7 billion rand in 1995 from 821 million in 1994 . 
&quot; Investment performance at the moment is very healthy . 
I don &apos;t have the exact figures but if we look at direct long-term investment , then we are very satisfied with what is happening , &quot; he added . 
Erwin said companies which disinvested from South Africa under apartheid had now reinvested -- an important sign of confidence . 
&quot; What we are starting to see , too , is new investors -- Malaysia , Korea and one or two Indian investors coming in . 
these are new investors and that is another healthy sign , &quot; he added . 
he said all projections indicated an extremely buoyant investment climate . 
&quot; In fact I think many people underestimate the investment prospects , epecially because they are linked to our really good performance on the trade front . 
&quot; And our trade expansion with Africa , Asia and Latin America is a very healthy performance , showing we are clearly turning the corner on competitiveness , &quot; Erwin said . 
but he said South Africa &apos;s relatively high interest rates remained a hurdle for investors , as did the unstable rand , which lost 29 percent of its value against the dollar last year . 
Erwin was upbeat about opportunities for trade . 
&quot; The African market is proving to be an exciting market for South Africa and the opening for South Africa of new markets in Asia , Latin America and the Middle East means that the opportunities are vastly greater than anything we have had before , &quot; Erwin said . 
he added that South Africa would host numerous trade delegations in 1997 , focusing on traditional trading partners but also new markets in Asia and Latin America . 
&quot; There can &apos;t be a more exciting time in South Africa &apos;s trading history than now and anyone that is not seeing that -- well , they must just go out of business because they are really sleeping &quot; .
