weekly store sales data , a measure of manufacturing activity in the Chicago area and new home sales figures for November will guide U.S. Treasury prices on Tuesday before trading ends early on New Year &apos;s Eve . 
U.S. financial markets will be closed on January 1 for the New Year &apos;s Day holiday . 
&quot; Probably the home sales number and the two retail sales numbers will get the market &apos;s attention , &quot; said Bill Hornbarger , fixed-income strategist at A.G. Edwards &amp; sons . 
the Lynch Jones &amp; Ryan Redbook report on store sales for the same period will come out at 1455 est / 1955 GMT , after the market has closed . 
&quot; I think people are still trying to get a gauge on how Christmas shopping went , &quot; said Hornbarger . 
&quot; The press reports that came out on sales activity right around Christmas were on the disappointing side , &quot; noted Daiwa Securities America Inc chief economist Michael Moran . 
&quot; Sales did not seem as vigorous as they did in the early part of December . 
that &apos;s quite different from the pattern you saw in previous years . 
retailers were disappointed in what they saw right around Christmas . 
on Friday , for instance , the department store chain of Nordstrom Inc said its holiday same-store sales declined from last year and that its fourth-quarter earnings would be below Wall Street expectations . 
Moran said he expected an increase in the BTM / Schroders store sales index , but only a small one . 
for Redbook , &quot; You should not be surprised at another slight downward revision to the monthly estimate , &quot; he said . 
market participants expected to see a bounce in November new home sales in line with increases reflected in other November housing market data , including the modest rise reported on Monday in November existing home sales to an annualized 4.04 million from an annualized 3.97 million in October . 
&quot; We expect a rise in new home sales , but unless it &apos;s quite large , I don &apos;t think it will shock the market , &quot; said David Sloan , senior economist at consulting firm I.D.E.A. 
Inc . 
also set for release at 1000 est / 1500 GMT on Tuesday are the December Chicago Purchasing Managers Index and the Conference Board &apos;s December consumer confidence index . 
&quot; The market will look at the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey for clues to the National ( Association of ) Purchasing Management &apos;s ( NAPM ) index , &quot; said Josh Feinman , vice president and global markets economist at Bankers Trust . 
the NAPM is due on the Thursday after New Year &apos;s Day . 
economists polled by Reuters forecast , on average , a slip in the Chicago PMI to 55.6 in December from 57.6 in November . 
in late trade on Monday , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was off slightly in thin trade , priced at 99-14 / 32 to yield 6.54 percent . 
market participants said the fact that most players have closed their books for the year made it highly unlikely that the market would budge from its current narrow range .
