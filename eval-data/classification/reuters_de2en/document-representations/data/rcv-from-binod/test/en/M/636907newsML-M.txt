* Dollar retreats late after repeated failures to break tough 1.7330 / 40 mark resistance , ends lower vs mark , little changed vs yen . 
* Buy dollar on dips mentality persists . 
expectations of strong payrolls , concern over soft-euro , gold row dollar supportive . 
* Mixed react to new French cabinet , little Mark / Paris impact . 
the dollar retreated late on Wednesday to end near the bottom of its tight range against the mark , but held steady against the yen and most other European currencies in a subdued U.S. session . 
talk of weak German jobs data and strong U.S. employment numbers , both due later this week , allowed the dollar to trade above the 1.73 mark level for much of the day and edge close to one-month peaks near midday . 
but the greenback ran out of steam after failing repeatedly to break through tough resistance at 1.7330 / 40 marks , ultimately turning lower . 
&quot; The dollar is looking tired here , &quot; said one trader at a major Wall Street investment bank . 
&quot; People still look at the dollar as the best game in town , but you &apos;re getting to a point where the risk / reward is getting worse . 
the dollar ended the day at 1.7275 / 85 marks , down from 1.7306 / 09 at the open and well off its session high of 1.7340 . 
against the yen , the dollar ended little changed at 116.28 / 38 versus 116.30 / 40 at the outset of trading . 
the German government appeared to have resolved its week-long dispute with the Bundesbank over plans to revalue the country &apos;s gold reserves on Wednesday . 
but traders said much damage had already been done and predicted lingering mark weakness and solid dollar support in the weeks to come , based on heightened prospects for a broader , weaker euro . 
&quot; I think the market is still thinking that monetary union will happen on time , but that it will be watered down , &quot; said Ricardo Gomes , foreign exchange manager at Republic National Bank of New York . 
&quot; It seems there will be an emphasis on boosting employment in Europe rather than austerity and inflation fighting and that translates into a weaker euro and stronger dollar . 
new French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin assembled a leftist cabinet of Socialists , Communists and Greens on Wednesday . 
although his appointments sparked little active trading in the franc , dealers were eager to see how the new government would address the issue of monetary union in the coming days . 
on Wednesday , more attention was focused on other European currencies , such as the Swiss franc and British pound , which were sold actively early on , then recovered late in the session . 
Jawboning by the Swiss National Bank hit the franc , while the British pound fell against the mark and the dollar after Bank of England Governor Eddie George spoke of sterling &apos;s &quot; exaggerated strength . 
&quot; You had a sharp selloff in sterling this morning ... but there was some sterling / mark being bought back this afternoon , &quot; said Robert Sabia , vice president at ING Barings Capital Markets . 
in late trading on Wednesday , sterling / mark stood at 2.8187 / 97 and mark / Swiss was changing hands at 0.8356 / 58 . 
dealers also began looking ahead to this Friday &apos;s U.S. payrolls report on Wednesday . 
in last month &apos;s April payrolls report , the U.S. jobless rate slipped to a 23-year low of 4.9 percent and many analysts believe a further drop in the May release could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its upcoming meeting in July . 
&quot; If it is a strong report it will convince people of the likelihood of a July rate hike and could give us an opportunity to revisit old highs against the mark , &quot; said Ben Strauss , assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co . 
weighing on the mark early Wednesday was a surprisingly sharp 1.3 percent drop in German industrial output for the month of April . 
keeping early dollar gains against the mark in check , however , were comments from Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer who said that he was &quot; interested in a strong mark in the future . 
the dollar ended at 1.4437 / 47 Swiss francs on Wednesday , down slightly from 1.4445 / 55 at the open . 
the pound recovered from overseas losses to end stronger at $ 1.6325 / 35 versus $ 1.6270 / 80 . 
the dollar pushed up to Canadian $ 1.3764 / 69 from C $ 1.3752 / 57 , while the Australian dollar ended at $ 0.7576 / 81 , down from $ 0.7588 / 93 .
