U.S. shares were steady to firmer in Europe on Thursday following Wall Street &apos;s 93-point surge on Wednesday as Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony eased investors &apos; concerns about interest rate hikes and stock valuations . 
but some strategists remained bearish about the Dow &apos;s near-term prospects , fearing that Wall Street &apos;s bubble could be about to burst . 
&quot; The fact that it rallied yesterday does scare the bears a bit , but I still think the Dow is risky , &quot; said Nick Glydon , technical analyst at Robert Fleming . 
&quot; On the other hand , with the Dow only 130 points short of an all-time high it is a bit scary to be going short at the moment . 
Glydon believes the Dow &apos;s bull run , which has seen U.S. blue chips jump by over 75 percent in the past two years alone , has already ended and he points to &quot; bearish &quot; technical indicators to back up this view . 
Glydon said one way of detecting a potential turning for a market comes from observing the motion of its 14-day or relative strength index ( RSI ) . 
the RSI is an oscillator defined to swings between zero and 100 PCT and is based on the proportion of how many times prices have closed higher over the past 14 days verses how many times they have closed lower . 
in the case of the Dow , the more times it closes higher over this period historically has confirmed a bull trend . 
but a turning point is usually signalled as the Dow pushes higher but the RSI starts to turn down owing to a greater proportion of down-days on the Industrials average . 
such divergence between the prevailing market direction and its RSI has occurred with the Dow . 
four months ago the Dow &apos;s 14-day RSI peaked at 88 PCT when the index closed at 6,547 on November 25 . 
since that time the Dow has romped up to 6,945 , yet the RSI has taken a fall to 54 PCT and , as a result , Glydon believes the Dow &apos;s uptrend is losing momentum and is one of the first signs of a shift from a bull to a bear phase . 
Glydon believes a bear market will be confirmed when the RSI falls below 50 percent and the Dow closes below 6,800 . 
&quot; The bear market will definitely be in place if that happens , &quot; he said . 
the Dow &apos;s strong push on Wednesday brought out a few buyers in Europe on Thursday but many players continued to stay away ahead of Friday &apos;s U.S. jobless figures , dealers said . 
&quot; The market here is relieved Greenspan didn &apos;t say anything to nasty but people are still pretty nervous about the non-farms ( U.S. payroll total ) , &quot; one market maker said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen some heavy volume in telephone which has underperformed recently . 
it is just catching up to the rest of the market , &quot; one dealer said . 
elsewhere , motor stocks were slightly lower after news that Chrysler Corp was to offer dealer incentives that will cost it $ 575 a car . 
Chrylser dipped $ 1 / 8 to $ 31 , Ford $ 1 / 4 to $ 31-7 / 8 and General Motors $ 1 / 8 to $ 57-1 / 8 . 
the March T-bond was up 8 / 32 to 110-22 / 32 while the yield on the 30-year cash long bond was standing at 6.82 percent .
