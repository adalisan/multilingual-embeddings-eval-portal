a top Malaysian politician has been charged in an Australian court with trying to take the equivalent of A $ 1.2 million ( $ 960,000 ) in cash out of the country without declaring it , police said on Tuesday . 
they said Muhammad Muhammad Taib , chief minister of the central Malaysian state of Selangor , was detected with the cash at Brisbane airport on Sunday and was ordered to appear at a magistrate &apos;s court in the city on Monday . 
&quot; He was not required to enter a plea yesterday , &quot; federal police agent Michael Spinks told Reuters . 
&quot; The whole matter has been remanded until the 21st of March . 
Muhammad , who is a vice-president of Malaysia &apos;s dominant political party , the United Malays National Organisation , is considered to be one of the country &apos;s most powerful men . 
Spinks said Muhammad was on a &quot; private business visit &quot; to Australia , where he arrived on December 16 , and was about to board a flight to New Zealand when the money was found . 
&quot; He was not here as a government employee , &quot; he said . 
Spinks said the money was found when Muhammad &apos;s baggage was examined at the airport . 
the money was a mixture of New Zealand , Malaysian and Singapore dollars . 
under Australian law , people leaving the country must declare and justify any amount worth over A $ 5,000 taken out , in whatever currency . 
a spokesman for Australia &apos;s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade declined to comment on the case , saying it was purely a police matter . 
Malaysian officials in Australia were unable to comment . 
Spinks said Muhammad would have to appear at the hearing in Brisbane in March and that he had been given unconditional bail . 
it is not clear if Muhammad is still in the country . 
Spinks said the chief minister might have to forfeit the money and pay a fine .
