the French embassy in Jakarta apparently rebuffed a bid for political asylum by three East Timorese men who broke into the mission on Wednesday , East Timorese sources said . 
the sources said the three men , who slipped past security guards at the embassy in the early hours of the day in a bid for political asylum in Portugal , had been evicted from the mission . 
an embassy spokesman said : &quot; There are no East Timorese in the French embassy . 
&quot; He refused to elaborate . 
the spokesman said he could not add to his statement when asked if the three men had broken into the embassy . 
a Reuters reporter saw the three men in the forecourt of the embassy shortly before dawn . 
they identified themselves by name and said they had scaled the embassy fence to seek political asylum in Portugal in protest against Indonesia &apos;s 1976 annexation of East Timor , a former Portuguese colony . 
some hours later , East Timorese sources told Reuters security guards in the embassy had evicted the three men from the mission . 
they said two of the three were injured while being forced out . 
it was not known where they had gone and the embassy spokesman declined to comment on the report . 
&quot; We are seeking political asylum in Portugal . 
we feel that our homeland has been taken over by the Indonesian military , &quot; one of the men , who identified himself as Sabino D &apos;Arujo , 26 , told Reuters shortly after the break-in . 
&quot; In East Timor we are always chased by the troops of the Suharto regime , &quot; said a second man who identified himself as Alberto Da Silva , 23 . 
the third man was named by his colleagues as Anatolio Francesco Arujo , 21 . 
the embassy break-in came a day after Indonesia &apos;s President Suharto visited East Timor for only the third time since he took power three decades ago . 
Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed the territory the following year in a move not recognised by the United Nations . 
DA Silva read out a statement calling for greater United Nations involvement in the troubled territory . 
the men made no mention of East Timorese Bishop Carlos Belo or self-exiled resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta who jointly won the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize last Friday . 
the statement asked for permanent presence of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) in three East Timor towns . 
at present the ICRC has only an office in the territory &apos;s capital of Dili . 
DA Silva said he and his colleagues wanted the United Nations to supervise a referendum on the future of East Timor , to include jailed resistance leader Xanana Gusmao in any international talks on East Timor , and to investigate all deaths in the territory since 1975 . 
he said they would ask the French ambassador to urge Paris to support the demands . 
it was the seventh such break-in at the French embassy since November last year . 
the spiked iron fence around the embassy was raised by a metre ( three feet ) after the last break-in , but the men said they still managed to scale it . 
a total of 89 East Timorese have been granted asylum in Portugal since September 1995 after breaking into foreign embassies in Jakarta . 
the number includes 25 who broke into the French embassy .
