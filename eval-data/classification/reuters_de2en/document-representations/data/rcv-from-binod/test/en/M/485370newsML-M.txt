world oil prices sank further on Thursday as rising supplies outweighed slack spring demand to take crude back into a lower price range not seen for nine months . 
London futures for bellwether North Sea Brent blend closed 32 cents a barrel weaker at $ 18.19 a barrel on top of a 59-cent slide on Wednesday . 
Brent has lost 25 percent of its value in the space of three months , having crumpled $ 6.50 in the three months to hit a nine-month low . 
&quot; Winter is over and there &apos;s simply too much crude on the market , &quot; said Peter Gignoux , head of the energy desk at brokers Smith Barney . 
&quot; Prices are back at the top of the old $ 13- $ 19 range -- and that could spell danger . 
oil prices rallied in the middle of last year to trade at $ 20- $ 25 for the first significant period of time since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis . 
some oil producers predicted crude had reached a new long-term plateau making up for years of price declines in real terms . 
but analysts say extra supplies are outrunning rising world demand as fresh crude outlets appear from all corners of the globe with the help of technology developments that allow new fields onstream faster and cheaper . 
dealers on Thursday said that key Atlantic Basin spot markets were suffering a glut of unsold cargoes . 
&quot; Essentially the availability of crude cargoes , including the North Sea and West African barrels , is simply too high , &quot; said brokers GNI in a daily report . 
spot price differentials for a range of crude grades have been under pressure for more than a month leaving buyers to take their pick . 
the U.S. Gulf crude market , the world &apos;s biggest import site , was awash with oil , forcing Latin American producers to slash asking prices . 
heavily discounted cash markets mean the price slump for oil producers has proved even heavier than the decline on futures markets . 
Saudi Arabian Light crude on Thursday for European buyers was valued at just over $ 15 a barrel compared to $ 23 in early January , a 35 percent slump . 
State Saudi oil company Aramco reduced prices for May loadings even further in order to keep its crudes competitive in the oversupplied market . 
sliding prices will mean heavier shipments of Iraqi crude under the U.N. oil-for-food deal now in its fourth month . 
Iraq is expected to increase sales in April in order to meet the $ 2 billion target permitted by the U.N. under the exchange . 
inventory data for the United States released on Tuesday showed fast-rising refined product output was eliminating a year-on-year gasoline stock deficit . 
the American Petroleum Institute data also showed a much larger than expected rise in crude stocks , leaving inventories well in excess of last year in the key U.S. Gulf refining region .
