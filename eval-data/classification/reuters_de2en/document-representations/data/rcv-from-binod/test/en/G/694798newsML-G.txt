reluctance of Nigeria &apos;s military rulers to state clearly their intentions regarding a timetable for a handover to civilian rule has strengthened doubts that the generals were not committed to democracy . 
the uncertainties seem poised to claim their first victim : State elections originally set for the third quarter of this year . 
politicians , who by now should have chosen their candidates for the first of four crucial polls on the road to democracy , are instead left in limbo and the political bandwagon stopped in its tracks . 
&quot; As at now neither the politicians nor their supporters can say categorically what has become of the transition timetable , &quot; wrote political commentator Yusuph Olaniyonu in the independent Thisday newspaper last week . 
Nigeria &apos;s five registered political parties last month asked the agencies supervising military ruler General Sani Abacha &apos;s transition programme to consider delaying state assembly and governorship polls set for the second half of this year so that they could all be held along with national polls in late 1998 . 
the Provisional Ruling Council met on Wednesday and said that an announcement would be made this week on the issue . 
&quot; shifting the ( local ) elections now looks inevitable since primaries to select candidates which should have taken place in this quarter have not been conducted and this shows Nigeria is just not serious about democracy , &quot; said one Western diplomat . 
&quot; tinkering with the process conveys the wrong signals , &quot; warned Matthew Kukah , an outspoken priest who heads the Catholic secretariat in Lagos . 
critics have long suspected that the programme , unveiled in 1995 when Nigeria faced severe local and foreign pressure to democratise , is a ruse to perpetuate military rule . 
under the current timetable , election of state legislators should be in the third quarter of 1997 followed by that of state governors in the fourth quarter . 
national assembly elections are scheduled for the second quarter of next year , followed by that of the president in the third quarter and the handover of power on October 1 . 
the political parties argue that holding the polls together will cut costs , make the transition less cumbersome and would not affect the final handover date . 
&quot; Nobody wants to transit forever , &quot; said Ibrahim Mantu , spokesman of the United Nigeria Congress Party ( UNCP ) , the leading party in municipal council elections held in March , the only ones contested so far on a party basis . 
&quot; The remaining elections should be held ( in the space of ) three weeks in the third quarter of next year so that members of the house of representatives , senate and president can be sworn in on the same day , &quot; he told reporters . 
opposition groups , however , argue that the move is a ploy to prolong Abacha &apos;s rule . 
&quot; Such retrogressive recommendation has exposed all the key actors in the tripartite organs of the regime as co-conspirators with the military junta in its bid to hold the nation to ransom , &quot; says the Campaign for Democracy pressure group . 
the army , which has ruled Africa &apos;s most populous nation for 27 out of its 37 years of independence from Britain , annulled a presidential vote in 1993 which would have restored democracy , plunging Nigeria into crisis that has not abated . 
in 1995 , Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth after it defied international opinion and hanged nine minority rights activists , including author Ken Saro-Wiwa . 
British foreign secretary Robin Cook made a stinging attack on Abacha &apos;s governmnent earlier this month , saying nothing had happened in the country to warrant lifting the suspension . 
a postponement of the state polls will further fuel Western view that the Nigerian authorities are dragging their feet on democracy and human rights , two issues on which it has been isolated by the West . 
ironically , Nigeria is in the forefront of the international campaign to restore democracy in Sierra Leone , a tiny West African state where soldiers seized power in a coup last month . 
&quot; What is good for Sierra Leone is good for us and charity ought to begin at home , &quot; said pro-democracy activist Sam Longe .
