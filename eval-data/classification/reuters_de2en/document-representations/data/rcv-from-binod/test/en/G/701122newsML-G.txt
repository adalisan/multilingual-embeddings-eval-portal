Brazil &apos;s transport minister , denounced last week for a &quot; racist &quot; comment about national soccer legend Pele , agreed on Tuesday to lobby for black rights in parliament , Globo television said . 
but despite profuse apologies , Eliseu Padilha failed to assuage representatives from 17 black rights groups at a two-hour meeting on Tuesday , and now faces criminal and civil actions over his remark . 
speaking at a transport seminar last Thursday , Padilha said : &quot; There are two blacks admired in Brazil . 
one is Pele , forever our king . 
the other is King Asphalt ; everybody likes asphalt . 
when reporters questioned him about the statement , he said he did not mean to demean Pele and was merely repeating a comment he had heard elsewhere . 
Padilha later apologised to Pele and said the press had wrongly interpreted his remarks as being racist . 
&quot; The minister will have every opportunity to apologise in court , &quot; Ivanir dos Santos , executive secretary of the Centre for Expression of marginalized populations , told television . 
&quot; Various Brazilian blacks are explaining themselves in court . 
they form the majority ( of inmates ) in Brazilian jails , and nobody thinks that if they apologise , they will be absolved , &quot; dos Santos added . 
Padilha will be prosecuted under a Brazilian law that makes racism a crime . 
&quot; My relationship with the movement and with the black citizens of Brazil at this moment is a question of ethics and of moral relation . 
the judicial question is a question we will judge at the appropriate moment , &quot; a shaken Padilha said on television . 
Pele , whose name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento , is Brazil &apos;s sports minister . 
although viewed abroad as one of the world &apos;s greatest athletes during his long soccer career , he has complained about being subjected to racism back home in Brazil . 
but he dismissed Padilha &apos;s remark as clumsiness and said he did not take offence .
