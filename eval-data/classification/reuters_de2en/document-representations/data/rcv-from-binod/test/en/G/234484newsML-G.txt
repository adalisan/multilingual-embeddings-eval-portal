at the insistence of Russia and China , the United Nations will shut down its military and police mission in Haiti in 6 to 8 months , according to a draft resolution to be adopted on Thursday . 
the Security Council document , worked out by the United States , Canada and other members , said the operation would be extended for another six months , until May 31 . 
but it left open a final renewal until July 31 , depending on a report from the U.N. secretary-general by the end of March . 
currently , there are 1,300 troops and close to 300 civilian police . 
half of the troops are financed by Canada and the United States rather than by all U.N. members . 
the new resolution cut the number of troops by 100 and diplomats said Canada might again make up the difference . 
it was not clear whether all foreign troops would leave Haiti next year . 
Canada , which is fielding more than 700 soldiers , might decide to keep a contingent there on a bilateral basis , depending on the situation in Haiti and on availability of funds , the envoys said . 
the current U.N. mandate expired last Friday and was extended by six days to allow for negotiations . 
Russia had insisted that a date be set for the end of the military part of the mission while China wanted it renewed for no more than five months . 
Moscow has frequently objected to keeping troops in the U.S. sphere of influence when the council rejected similar requests for peacekeepers in the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Tajikistan . 
China has a history of challenging the entire operation because of Haiti &apos;s ties with Taiwan , which it considers a renegade province , despite a marked improvement in relations between Beijing and the impoverished Caribbean nation . 
last February China threatened to veto the military force in Haiti unless its numbers were reduced , prompting Canada to rescue the mission by paying for its own troops for six months . 
in June , the United States as well as Canada helped pay for the Canadian and Pakistani troops . 
one of the operation &apos;s main tasks is to train and monitor Haiti &apos;s fledgling police , which replaced the previous paramilitary contingents loyal to the military junta that overthrew elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 . 
he was restored to power three years later by a U.S.-led 22,000-member multinational force . 
the United Nations took over peacekeeping in March 1995 with 6,000 troops , a number which has been steadily reduced since then .
