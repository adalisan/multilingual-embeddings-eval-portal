Bank of Spain Governor Luis Angel Rojo warned on Tuesday that although the 1997 Spanish budget contained austere measures the nation would need to keep narrowing its deficit in coming years . 
&quot; It is fundamental that ( Spain ) continue to reduce the public deficit in coming years because this is going to be the general approach , &quot; Rojo told the legislative budget committee . 
the five-month-old government officially submitted the 1997 budget draft to the legislature at the end of September and the Bank of Spain recognised the effort three days later with a reduction of 50 basis points in its key money market rate . 
there are &quot; elements of restriction &quot; on the economy in the 1997 budget draft which gave the Bank of Spain the scope to cut the rate to 6.75 percent , Rojo said . 
in the draft , the government cut the deficit to three percent of gross domestic product next year from a projected 4.4 percent this year and 6.6 percent in 1995 , a threshhold it must reach to be a contender for European monetary union in 1999 . 
but Rojo said countries planning to take part in currency union must continue reducing their budget in order to give the European single currency process more credibility . 
their aim should be a deficit of one percent or less of GDP . 
in coming months doubts are likely to emerge on the markets about &quot; the sustainability of the convergence process &quot; toward the common currency , he said . 
to reinforce credibility , a stability pact will likely be agreed with a three-year time horizon among the countries in the single currency . 
Rojo also said that it is reasonable to close the year with CPI at 3.4 percent year-on-year for a yearly average of 3.6 percent . 
&quot; This is reasonable and it is not optimistic , &quot; Rojo said .
