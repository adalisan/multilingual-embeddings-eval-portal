* Canada &apos;s dollar opened weaker at C $ 1.3870 ( US $ 0.7209 ) in light trading on Tuesday after Statistics Canada reported softer-than-expected consumer price data for May , traders said . 
* They said the absence of inflationary pressures in the Canadian economy would ease pressure on the Bank of Canada to tighten monetary policy in the upcoming months . 
&quot; Unfortunately , this may contribute a little bit more to the Canadian dollar &apos;s woes , &quot; said Michael Gregory , economist and strategist with Lehman Brothers . 
&quot; People are expecting the Bank of Canada to push back that point where they first tighten , and this number today would suggest that they are not going to be in any hurry , &quot; Gregory added . 
analysts said currency markets would keep a close eye on U.S. inflation data due to be released this morning at 0830 EDT / 1230 GMT . 
a Reuter survey of economists forecast consumer prices in May rose 0.2 percent . 
a stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation number , however , may not be enough to push the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on July 1-2 . 
&quot; We &apos;ll wait and see what the U.S. numbers bring us , &quot; said Reid Farrill , corporate foreign exchange adviser for CIBC Wood Gundy . 
&quot; Given the fact that last week &apos;s numbers were on the soft side , I don &apos;t think the market is expecting any major change . 
&quot; Any inflationary numbers would probably surprise the market , &quot; Farrill said . 
on the crosses , the Canada dollar climbed to 81.87 from Monday &apos;s 81.63 and rose to 1.2510 marks from Monday &apos;s 1.2487 marks .
