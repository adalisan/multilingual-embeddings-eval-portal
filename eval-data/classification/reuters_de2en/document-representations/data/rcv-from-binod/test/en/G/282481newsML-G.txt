Indian authorities said on Tuesday they expected the death toll in a bomb attack on a train to be far below the 300 initially believed to have been killed . 
Dutt , inspector-general of police in Assam state , told Reuters by telephone that 24 bodies had been found by daybreak after Monday evening &apos;s attack . 
&quot; There might be more , but not 300 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That ( 300 ) is an exaggeration . 
soon after the attack in the northeastern region , a senior police official in Assam &apos;s capital Guwahati and local news agencies said at least 300 people were believed dead . 
&quot; It appears that these figures were given by somebody who did not know , &quot; K.K. 
Gupta , a senior Railway Ministry official , told Reuters in New Delhi . 
local news agencies said that by late Tuesday morning , 32 bodies had been recovered at the site of the blast in Sensapani , 200 km ( 125 miles ) west of Guwahati . 
more were believed to be inside the wreckage , they said . 
authorities believed explosives had been laid on the railway track , not in a train carriage , and that there may have been two or three blasts , Dutt said . 
ten carriages hurtled off the track , including the three destroyed in the explosion , he said .
