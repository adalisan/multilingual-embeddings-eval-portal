President Bill Clinton made a triumphal entry to Chicago on Wednesday as his running mate Al Gore cast the 1996 election as a battle between the future and a past represented by Republican Bob Dole . 
addressing the Democratic convention , Gore began by calling Dole a &quot; good and decent man &quot; and praised his service in World War II , but he swiftly launched a double-fisted attack on the man from Kansas . 
&quot; Make no mistake : there is a profound difference in outlook between the president and the man who seeks his office , &quot; Gore declared . 
&quot; In his speech from ( the Republican convention in ) San Diego , Senator Dole offered himself as a bridge to the past . 
tonight Bill Clinton and I offer ourselves as a bridge to the future , &quot; he said to cheers . 
&quot; Let there be no doubt : the future lies with the party of hope -- and the man from Hope who leads it , &quot; said Gore , referring to Clinton &apos;s birthplace of Hope , Arkansas . 
Clinton , Gore said , &quot; never stooped to their level . 
and of course , he never attacked his opponent &apos;s wife . 
&quot; First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has been a frequent Republican target . 
the president himself completed a barnstorming 559-mile ( 895 km ) train trip on Wednesday that has helped him build a formidable lead in the opinion polls over Dole . 
&quot; Seventy days to four more years ! 
&quot; an exuberant Clinton shouted to a knot of waving spectators near Kalamazoo as his flag-bedecked , 13-car campaign train swept through Michigan . 
huge crowds welcomed Clinton at every stop as the president cut a swathe through five Midwestern states , issuing new policy initiatives along the way . 
after leaving the train in Michigan City , Indiana , Clinton flew to Chicago by helicopter , landing on a baseball field crowded with hundreds of well-wishers including wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea as a full moon crept over the horizon . 
&quot; When I accept the nomination of our party tomorrow and start this campaign , it will be the first American campaign for the 21st century and the last campaign for Bill Clinton , &quot; the president told the crowd . 
&quot; Let me just say the best is yet to come , the best days for America , the best days of the Clinton-Gore administration , the best days of our efforts together to lift up our country and move forward , &quot; he said . 
three new polls on Wednesday put the president &apos;s advantage over Dole at a comfortable 13 to 15 percentage points and Clinton is hoping for a further boost from the final two days of the Democratic convention . 
as day three of the convention began , delegates at the convention centre were pumped up with excitement after two days of political speeches punctuated , by shimmying to the Latin beat of the Macarena dance craze , and regular video updates of Clinton &apos;s progress across the heartland . 
delegates were to formally nominate Clinton for a second White House term late on Wednesday in the traditional roll call of states . 
contrary to expectations , Clinton would not visit the convention Wednesday . 
spokesman Mike McCurry said he planned to stay in his hotel , rest his voice , which was hoarse after four days on the stump , and work on his acceptance speech . 
Clinton will formally accept the nomination on Thursday and delegates were readying the kind of welcome usually reserved for pop idols and sports heroes . 
Clinton , 50 , is the first Democratic incumbent since Franklin Roosevelt to win his party &apos;s nomination without facing an internal party challenge . 
in Dole , he faces a 73-year-old opponent who would be the oldest man ever to take office for a first term if he won the November 5 election . 
that makes the election a fascinating contest between Clinton , the first baby boomer to reach the White House , and Dole , almost certainly the last stalwart of the World War II generation to seek the presidency . 
for all the doubts about his character and the scandals that have dogged his presidency , Clinton enjoys approval ratings as high as any president seeking re-election in recent memory . 
his dominance over the Democratic Party is undisputed . 
even leaders of the party &apos;s once all-powerful liberal wing have fallen meekly into line as Clinton dragged them towards the political centre .
