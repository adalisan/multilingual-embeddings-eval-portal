Palestinians from all political leanings called on Sunday for attacks on Jewish settlers and mass protests over the spread of posters depicting the Moslem Prophet Mohammad as a pig stomping on the Koran . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the posters and telephoned the Arab Mayor of Hebron to apologise . 
&quot; It is lawful to shed the blood of settlers who are responsible for this big crime , &quot; an emergency committee of Hebron nationalist and Islamist activists said in a statement . 
&quot; The cowardly deed is a great insult for all Moslems , their religion and holy books , &quot; the statement said . 
&quot; The people have the right to defend their holy places and to struggle against the occupation , the statement said . 
Islam and Judaism view pigs as unclean and ban the eating of pork . 
&quot; I felt it necessary to call the mayor of Hebron to express not only my personal revulsion but the revulsion of the entire people of Israel , &quot; Netanyahu told Jewish leaders at a conference in Jerusalem . 
&quot; This runs counter to our outlook as Jews and our respect and appreciation for the Islamic religion and for its founder the Prophet Mohammad , &quot; he said . 
Israeli President Ezer Weizman said the poster was an &quot; idiotic , stupid &quot; drawing . 
Hebron , divided into Israeli- and Palestinian-controlled sectors , is a hotbed of Jewish and Moslem militancy and has been site of fierce Arab-Israeli clashes in recent weeks . 
in the West Bank village of Beit Ummar near Hebron , dozens of Palestinian youths stoned passing Israeli vehicles in protest against the offending posters , witnesses said . 
they said a Jewish settler fired shots in the direction of the demonstrators after stones were thrown towards his vehicle . 
a Jerusalem magistrate &apos;s court remanded for five days 25-year-old Jerusalem resident Tatyana Suskin suspected of pasting the posters on 20 storefronts near a Jewish settlement enclave in the West Bank , Israel &apos;s army radio said . 
police said they arrested Suskin after she threw a rock through the windshield of an Arab &apos;s car in Hebron and found posters in her possession . 
&quot; It &apos;s connected with their views -- they don &apos;t want any Jews at all in Hebron or in this area whatsoever . 
it &apos;s unimportant how we will behave . 
they will demand more and more . 
I only say they are using their religion to force people to fight Jews , &quot; Suskin told Israel &apos;s army radio . 
some 500 Palestinians representing President Yasser Arafat &apos;s Fatah faction , the main opposition Islamist group Hamas , the smaller Islamic Jihad and leftist factions convened an emergency meeting to respond to the posters . 
&quot; We hold the Israeli government completely responsible for the results of this cowardly deed which has been done with the knowledge of the Israeli army , &quot; the statement said . 
it called for a mass demonstration on Tuesday and a general strike on Wednesday in Hebron . 
Israel handed over most of Hebron to Palestinian self-rule in January but kept troops in about 20 percent of the city to guard some 400 Jewish settlers who live and study in fortified enclaves in the heart of the city of 100,000 Palestinians .
