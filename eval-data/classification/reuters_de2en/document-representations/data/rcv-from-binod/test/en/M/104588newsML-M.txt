U.S. debt futures ended lower , erasing gains late amid active selling in reaction to a Fed governor &apos;s comments that curbing inflation may mean a temporary rise in future rates , traders said . 
Federal Reserve govenor Lawrence Lindsey made the comments in remarks prepared for delivery to a community development lending conference . 
December T-bonds initially slipped to 110-27 / 32 , through the GLOBEX low of 110-29 / 32 , and later gained momentum to the downside and fell through the 200-day moving average of 110-25 / 32 . 
the 110-25 / 32 level also represented a break-out level from Friday &apos;s rally . 
earlier in the day , traders and analysts were impressed that the contract did not challenge the 110-25 / 32 level . 
one analyst noted that the first trade after the September nonfarm payrolls data and the unemployment rate were released Friday . 
further support is seen at 110-10 / 32 , December &apos;s closing price on both the Wednesday and Thursday prior to Friday &apos;s employment data , he said . 
he said 110-10 / 32 to 110-14 / 32 area would be a critical area . 
March Eurodollars backed down to 94.24 on continued light profit taking , they said . 
support is at 94.22 . 
&quot; Eurodollars may have gotten a little ahead of themselves , &quot; Jim Collins , a debt analyst at Smith Barney , said . 
he added , &quot; Certainly , Friday will be critical . 
on Friday , both the September producer price index ( PPI ) and retail sales reports will be released . 
PPI is forecast to rise around 0.3 percent overall and 0.2 percent in the core rate . 
&quot; That translates into an increase of 2.9 percent year-over-year overall and 1.3 percent year-over-year in the core rate , &quot; he said , noting those year-over-year levels would show a decline of 0.1 percent in both overall and core rates . 
at the end of pit trade , December T-bonds were down 17 / 32 at 110-18 / 32 , 10-year notes were off 8 / 32 at 108-06 / 32 , March T-bills were down two basis points at 94.90 , December Eurodollars were off a basis point at 94.35 and March Eurodollars were three basis points lower at 94.25 .
