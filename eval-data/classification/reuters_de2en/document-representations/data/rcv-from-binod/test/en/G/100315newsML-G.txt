Taleban and rival military forces faced each other in a tense standoff in mountains north of Kabul on Monday amid growing concern among Afghanistan &apos;s neighbours that hostilities could spread in the region . 
the hardline Islamic militia , which captured Kabul a week ago , pushed northward toward the strategic Panjsher Valley where an offensive against former military chief Ahmad Shah Masood appeared to stall . 
Taleban forces exchanged sporadic artillery and mortar fire with Masood forces at his valley stronghold near Golbahar , but military analysts questioned whether the attackers could wrest the valley from Masood , who defended it successfully against Russian troops for years . 
in an effort to neutralize a possible ally of Masood , the Taleban acting foreign minister appealed to General Abdul Rashid Dostum , who is leading his own army of Uzbek fighters , to remain neutral in the offensive against Masood . 
as the threat of increased hostilities continued , Afghanistan &apos;s neighbors stepped up expressions of concerns . 
Iran , which is Shi &apos;ite Moslem and has been hostile to the Sunni fundamentalist Taleban , said the prospects of peace in Afghanistan were poor if a single faction tried to govern alone . 
&quot; No ethnic group can run that country without an active contribution from the other ethnic groups . 
and no religious group can run the country without a contribution from the others , &quot; Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said on Iranian television , which was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation . 
earlier , Alexander Lebed , Russia &apos;s national security chief and a veteran of Moscow &apos;s 10-year war in Afghanistan , called the situation very tense . 
Lebed , who spoke to reporters on Sunday on a visit to NATO headquarters , said , &quot; These military actions may have negative repercussions . 
NATO officials have expressed concern that instability in Afghanistan could have consequences for member-nation Turkey . 
in his appeal to Dostum , Acting Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Ghous said the Uzbek general would be making a mistake if he took sides with Masood , the ousted government military chief . 
he seemed to suggest Dostum could keep his heavy weapons as long as he posed no danger to the government . 
the Taleban official invited Masood also to accept a general amnesty offer but said Masood would have to yield his heavy weapons . 
if Dostum and Masood , who were briefly allies after the communist government in Kabul fell , did rejoin forces , they would form a strong alliance against the Taleban that would effectivly divide Afghanistan and could be supported by the largely Moslem states of Central Asia , especially Uzbekistan , Western sources said . 
at the scene of the standoff near Golbahar , bulldozers entered the valley north of Kabul to clear mines and landslides detonated ahead of Masood &apos;s retreat . 
the Taleban made only limited progress along the valley floor after their offensive , which had begun on Saturday . 
&quot; The main objective now is to take that mountain where the shooting is coming from , &quot; said one fighter , pointing to a peak several kilometres ( miles ) away sprouting occasional plumes of smoke and dust from Taleban tank shells . 
some locals rejected Taleban claims that it had taken by force the two hills at the entrance to the steep-sided valley , saying locally born Masood had withdrawn for fear of shelling of civilians or the town of Golbahar at the mouth of the gorge .
