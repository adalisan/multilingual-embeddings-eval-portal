Italian army tanks and armoured vehicles took up position near a hotel in the lawless Albanian port of Vlore on Thursday , in a show of strength against gunmen who have staged street battles for three days . 
witnesses said armed supporters of rival local warlords exchanged gunfire during a rally of rightist parties taking part in Sunday &apos;s general election pitting President Sali Berisha &apos;s Democratic Party against the Socialist opposition . 
police in the port said one person had died and two were injured during the day &apos;s violence . 
one witness saw a fighter erect a machine gun outside the Hotel Bologna , housing international reporters , many of them Italians , in the Adriatic port and aim it at the hotel . 
but Italian troops , based in the town since mid-April as part of a multinational protection force , were quickly despatched to the area from their local base . 
a tank approached the machine gun emplacement and the gunman took off his white tee-shirt and waved it , apparently indicating he was prepared to withdraw . 
the tank was followed by an armoured vehicle , which rolled over the machine gun and smashed it , the witness said . 
the Italians did not open fire and calm appeared to return to the area , though sporadic shooting could still be heard in another part of the town of 90,000 people . 
like most of southern Albania , Vlore is run by a &quot; Salvation Committee &quot; violently opposed to Berisha and hoping the election will force him from office . 
but the election has been threatened by the outbreak of daily street battles between two gangs , with residents scurrying inside at the sound of a warning siren . 
Vlore was the starting point in January of largely spontaneous protests by investors who lost their savings in the collapse of fraudulent investment schemes . 
angry protesters blamed the calamity on Berisha , who is campaigning to defend a huge majority his Democratic Party won in last year &apos;s parliamentary ballot . 
opposition Socialist rallies still chant &quot; Vlore , Vlore ! 
&quot; as a symbol of resistance to the president . 
Berisha &apos;s Democrats say they dare not set foot in the port . 
his opponents warn of unstoppable violence if Berisha remains in place after the vote . 
&quot; The people will vote and they will remove Berisha , &quot; said Albert Shyti , a former rebel leader in Vlore and now a candidate for the opposition Social Democratic Party . 
&quot; If they don &apos;t remove him with their votes , they will take up their guns and remove him with their guns . 
from the furious , but principled protests of January , Vlore has descended into a daily cauldron of tactical street warfare , where masked fighters use trees , posts and gutted cars to stake out territorial advantage . 
the two clans , led by local warlords , broadly favour or oppose Berisha but the distinction is blurred by a web of other business and clan interests . 
residents creep through streets as early as possible to buy bread -- fruit and vegetables are unavailable -- and conduct whatever other urgent business they have before the siren goes . 
shops abruptly put up shutters , chairs and tables are bundled safely inside cafes and the barrage begins . 
Wednesday evening &apos;s skirmishes , with each side fielding heavy machine guns , anti-tank launchers , bombs and grenades , went on until nearly midnight . 
Italian troops patrolled the town and groups of armed men moved off down the main road leading northwards out of town . 
salvation Committee members this week met Italian troops and observers of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , overseeing the elections , to try to patch together arrangements for safe voting . 
but many residents have little hope that will happen . 
&quot; Now we have fighting every day , &quot; said one elderly man . 
&quot; How can we possibly vote safely ?
