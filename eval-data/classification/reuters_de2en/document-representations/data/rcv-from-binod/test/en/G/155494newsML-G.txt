France &apos;s official journal gave notice on Wednesday that bankrupt ex-businessman and soccer boss Bernard Tapie was no longer a European Parliament Deputy . 
the Journal Officiel published a governmment decree signed by Prime Minister Alain Juppe and the ministers for justice , foreign affairs and European affairs , which notes that &quot; the ineligibility of Mr Bernard Tapie puts an end to his mandates as a representative of the European Parliament &quot; . 
the text of the decree was sent on Tuesday evening to the speaker of the European Parliament and France &apos;s ambassador at the institution will give the speaker &apos;s office official notification on Thursday in Strasbourg . 
a parliamentary committee was due to meet Wednesday or Thursday to rule on the decree . 
it has the power to overturn the decision , but French officials said this was unlikely . 
Tapie , declared by European Union law , the laws of individual member states determine eligibility for the European parliament , French authorities say . 
Tapie , target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now-destroyed business empire and the Marseille soccer team he once ran , has been sentenced to jail terms of eight and six months for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match . 
he is appealing in both cases to the Supreme Court .
