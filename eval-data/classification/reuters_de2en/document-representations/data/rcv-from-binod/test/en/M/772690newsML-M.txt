the benchmark three-month March euroyen futures contract was steady just below its contract high at midday on Friday amid a general lack of factors , although dealers reported bullish sentiment and said fresh highs could be possible next week . 
but others said wariness about the contract &apos;s present strength could well lead to consolidation at current levels for some time . 
the March ended the morning at 99.20 , unchanged from Thursday &apos;s settlement and just below the contract high of 99.22 hit in Thursday morning trade . 
it moved from 99.18 to 99.20 . 
volume was a lacklustre 19,979 contracts . 
sales by unspecified U.S. operators , probably funds , on SIMEX apparently pushed the March lower during early trade , but the firm sentiment inspired buying and helped erase these losses , one trust bank trader said . 
&quot; And we may see even more gains next week on spillover strength from Japanese government bonds ( JGBs ) , which could take a shot at 127.00 , &quot; he added . 
but he also said , and others agreed , that the market appeared to be wary about taking March euroyen futures much higher at this point , and additional gains might be slow . 
the next key point for the March is likely to be 99.25 , with the downside solid near 99.15 over the next week . 
a trader with a city bank &apos;s securities arm said a decisive break above 99.23 could take the contract quickly up to 99.28 . 
the market will keep one eye on U.S. unemployment data , due out at 1230 GMT on Friday , to see how the U.S. bond market responds , but otherwise there are few new factors to be found . 
little impact is expected from Japan July domestic vehicle sales , due for release at 0500 GMT . 
the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) injected a net 400 billion into the money market in its regular morning operation . 
key overnight call money was being traded mainly at 0.50 percent , unchanged from Thursday &apos;s weighted average . 
strong demand for short-term funds appeared to be keeping the overnight rate supported despite the generous operation , which kept the money market in surplus by around 300 billion yen . 
around 10 billion yen worth of three-month certificates of deposit ( CDs ) were issued at 0.63 percent . 
on Thursday , around 10 billion yen of three-month CDs were issued at 0.63 percent and around 160 billion yen at 0.64 percent .
