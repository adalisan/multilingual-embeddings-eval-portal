U.S. high-yield issuance maintained its luster on Thursday , although tight pricings capped gains when issues freed to trade , traders said . 
new issues still traded higher , but those gains paled next to the immediate two- to three-point gains seen for the most solid industrial credits last week . 
and in a major spate of profit-taking , bonds from TransAmerican Energy Corp &apos;s $ 1.5 billion refinancing of last week fell 1-1 / 2 points following a big seller in early dealings . 
the $ 475 million 11-1 / 2 percent notes due 2002 were last seen bid at 100-1 / 2 compared with 102 at the open . 
likewise , TransAmerican &apos;s $ 1.13 billion ( proceeds ) zero coupon bonds due 2002 fell by one and a half points to 76-1 / 2 bid near the close . 
the zeros priced at 77.6779 . 
but new issues priced late on Wednesday and Thursday suggested there was still plenty of cash in portfolio manager &apos;s hands . 
despite talk of paltry allocations , some players sensed the frenzy for fresh paper was coming off its white hot pace of last week . 
one fund manager blamed the richness of new issues for spotty softening of spreads and less enthusiastic upmoves for the latest more than a dozen deals this week . 
&quot; These are not bad companies I just think they are very rich -- like specialty Retailers ( Stage Stores ) at 200 basis points off , &quot; said one fund manager in New York . 
issuance on Thursday included Standard Pacific Corp &apos;s $ 100 million 8-1 / 2 percent 10-year Ba2 / bb senior notes , were quoted at 99.75 in late trade compared with a pricing of 99.306 . 
the issue priced via lead manager Salomon Brothers . 
specialty Retailers &apos; $ 200 million eight-year 8-1 / 2 percent Ba3 / BB-minus senior notes , priced at par late on Wednesday to yield 200 basis points over the curve , were quoted at 101-1 / 8 . 
the specialty Retailers $ 100 million 10-year B2 / single-B nine percent senior subordinated notes , priced at 99.66 , were also seen at 101-1 / 8 bid . 
elsewhere , Greater Beijing 1st expressways upsized its two-part 144A deal by $ 13 million , pricing at total of $ 100 million seven-year debt and $ 188 million 10-year debt via Morgan Stanley Dean Witter . 
seven-year 9.25 percent debt was priced to yield 387.5 basis points over and the 10-year 9-1 / 2 percent debt was priced to yield 312.5 basis points over . 
both tranches featured one-year interest reserves . 
secondary high-yield prices made small gains but spreads widened as U.S. treasuries rallied on news of softer than expected retail sales in May and downward revisions to April &apos;s numbers . 
prices were cuffed up 1 / 4 point on average . 
of particular interest but no particular surprise to the market , sources on Thursday revealed EchoStar Communications Corp will access the high-yield market late next week with a $ 325 million offering . 
EchoStar is seeking additional financing for satellites after plans for a $ 1.0 billion investment from News Corp went awry . 
without that investment , EchoStar had said it would not be able to fulfill its business plan . 
the two companies are suing each other over the deal that unravelled . 
notes will be issued through an EchoStar holding company via a Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette syndicate . 
one money manager said he was surprised the deal was announced as straight debt , and not as a convertible issue . 
turning to investment grades , large deals were again the norm , led by Hartford Life Inc &apos;s three-tranche $ 650 million A2 / single-A issue from lead manager Goldman Sachs &amp; Co . 
the deal was comprised of $ 200 million seven-year 6.90 percent notes to yield 48 basis points over ; $ 200 million 10-year 7.10 percent notes to yield 65 basis points over ; $ 250 million 30-year 7.65 percent debt priced to yield 85 basis points over the curve . 
many new investment grade deals of Wednesday were trading in line with issued spreads or tighter . 
market participants suggested the already heady flow of issues would increase as the Treasury rally solidifies . 
the 30-year Treasury bond closed up 26 / 32 to yield 6.78 percent . 
the 10-year note was up 19 / 32 to yield 6.49 percent .
