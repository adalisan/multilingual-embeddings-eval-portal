late fund selling , led by Rosenthal Collins &apos; sale of one million bushels , drove CBOT March wheat futures to close lower after setting a new contract low , with the rest of the market mixed , traders said . 
sell stops were hit in the waning 30 minutes of trading and March dropped to a new low of $ 3.52 per bushel , below the previous low of $ 3.54-1 / 2 which was set Friday . 
CBOT wheat futures closed 3-1 / 2 cents per bushel lower to three higher , with March down 3-1 / 2 at $ 3.52-1 / 2 . 
wheat was firm in early dealings and deferred months ended higher on bear spreading and on signals the market was technically oversold for the short term . 
traders said Cargill Inc was a scale-down buyer of wheat futures . 
fundamentals were little changed with the market undergoing a shift before the release Wednesday of the U.S. Agriculture Department &apos;s February supply / demand report , the traders said . 
analysts Friday said they did not expect USDA to make much of a change in the wheat balance sheets with Australian production a possible wild card . 
&quot; There is not much change in the domestic situation , but we should have an upward adjustment for Australia . 
it seems likely and logical they will bump it up a million ( tonnes ) , &quot; said Joel Karlin , analyst for Chicago-based Everen Securities . 
the market may have received a slight boost from Monday &apos;s USDA weekly export inspections report . 
USDA said for the week ended January 6 U.S. wheat inspected for export totaled 14.140 million bushels , slightly above trade expectations for 10.0 to 14.0 million bushels . 
but most traders agreed the early and short-lived gains in nearby contracts were mainly technical with several key indicators confirming the market was oversold for the short term . 
the nine day relative strength index ( RSI ) for the March closed at 23 percent . 
the trade generally considers an RSI of 30 or less as an indicator of an oversold market . 
Chartists early Monday cited first resistance in the March at $ 3.57-1 / 2 and second at $ 360-1 / 2 . 
the session high for March was $ 3.60-1 / 2 .
