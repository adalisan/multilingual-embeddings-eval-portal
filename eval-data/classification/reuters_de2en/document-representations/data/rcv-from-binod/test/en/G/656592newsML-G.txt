a jury ended its first day of deliberations on Thursday without reaching a decision on whether Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment for blowing up an Oklahoma City federal building . 
&quot; We will recess your deliberations now and you should put the matter at rest as best you can and you yourselves rest , &quot; federal Judge Richard Matsch said before excusing the jurors for the day . 
Matsch ordered the jury of seven men and five women to resume their deliberations at 8.30 a.m. local time ( 1430 GMT ) on Friday . 
the jury deliberated for about four and three-quarter hours after being given the case by Matsch shortly after noon . 
the jurors must decide whether McVeigh , a 29-year-old former soldier , should be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole for the April 19 , 1995 , bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people . 
the jury earlier heard a plea from the prosecution to sentence McVeigh to death and from defence attorneys to spare his life to prevent him from taking any secrets about the bombing to the grave .
