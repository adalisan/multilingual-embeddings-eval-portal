Byron Black &apos;s confidence is rising like the warm weather in the desert . 
black outlasted unseeded Australian Sandon Stolle 6-4 5-7 7-5 on Wednesday to reach the quarterfinals of the $ 328,000 Arizona tennis tournament . 
but after surprising top-seed Marcelo Rios of Chile in a third-set nailbiter on Tuesday , Black found himself in a similar situation -- down a late break to the hard-serving Australian . 
but the aggresive double-fisted baseliner had the answer . 
&quot; It was very similar match , and today I kept it together , &quot; said Black of the two-hour-11-minute victory . 
black lost serve to fall behind 3-5 . 
but he broke Stolle twice and served a pair of aces in the final game to cap a four-game match-ending run for the win . 
&quot; I had nothing to lose and I think Sandy put a bit of pressure on himself , &quot; said Black , who has one singles title and 14 doubles &apos; crowns since joining the ATP Tour in l991 . 
black knew he would have his hands full against Stolle , who was a semifinalist here last year . 
&quot; I knew today it would be tough because Sandy is very dangerous , &quot; Black explained . 
&quot; He &apos;s a big player with a big game ( 12 aces ) . 
his serve is tough , he covers the net so well and it &apos;s tough to lob because the ball flies due to the altitude . 
black began the new year slowly , hampered by a quadricep injury . 
but he &apos;s in his third quarterfinal and second in as many weeks before losing to Australian Patrick Rafter in Philadelphia last week . 
&quot; I really started off the first month struggling a bit and couldn &apos;t really get going . 
just of late , I &apos;ve been winning a few matches in succession and that &apos;s given me a bit of confidence . 
with the rash of upsets , Black has a chance to capture his second singles title though he &apos;s not thinking too far ahead just yet . 
&quot; One at a time .
