the forces of ousted Afghan military chief Ahmad Shah Masood sent rockets slamming into Kabul airport on Sunday in a strong signal to his fundamentalist foes that his forces were closing in on the capital . 
Reuter correspondent Kurt Schork , travelling with Masood &apos;s largely ethnic Tajik troops , said elated fighters , shouting the battlecry &quot; God is greatest &quot; , seized the village of Hussein Kot on Sunday , putting them just 20 km ( 12 miles ) from the city . 
witnesses said later they had pushed further south . 
that left Masood with just an 13 km ( eight mile ) stretch of the main road leading from the north across a lightly-populated , dusty plain to the entrance to the Kabul valley . 
&quot; God willing , we will be in Kabul today or tomorrow , &quot; Masood commander Gul Haider said in Hussein Kot , which the Taleban were peppering with mortar , artillery and rocket fire . 
the witnesses said the mostly ethnic Pushtun Taleban forces appeared to be withdrawing slowly and methodically . 
&quot; They were worried but not panicking , &quot; said one . 
but local villagers said a Taleban force had been trapped behind Masood &apos;s lines and was still resisting . 
Masood spokesman Mirabuddin Astana told reporters the Uzbek forces of Abdul Rashid Dostum , which joined the Tajiks last week , were pushing down a parallel road to Kabul and were about 30 km ( 18 miles ) from the city . 
travellers said later there did not appear to have been any significant change in the front line on that road . 
shortly after Masood took Hussein Kot , a barrage of rockets exploded around Kabul airport where the purist Islamic militia , which took the capital three weeks ago , base part of their air force . 
Schork said they were fired by a multiple rocket launcher near the village . 
&quot; Those are headed for Kabul airport , &quot; Masood officer Shirin Agha told reporters as the weapon fired a salvo . 
at least seven rockets landed within the perimeter of the sprawling airport and aircraft , civilian and military , immediately took off . 
the capital , which has been ravaged by factional fighting over the past four years , took the barrage in its stride , but the detonations were a stark reminder of just how close another battle for capital seems to be . 
in Hussein Kot , no civilians were seen on streets which echoed with the sound of incoming and outgoing artillery fire . 
rocket and artillery impacts sent plumes of dust and smoke spoiralling skyward . 
Taleban spokesmen declined to talk to reporters about what their ultra-conservative movement would do , but they have spurned warnings from Masood to quit Kabul or face battle . 
they have said the Taleban have enough men to defend Kabul , but their fighters to the rear signs of alarm as Masood &apos;s men fought their way nearer the capital . 
at the top of the pass leading into Kabul on Sunday morning , a Taleban guard pointed his gun at a Taleban pickup truck and told the driver to get back to the fighting . 
he was allowed to go on only after pointing to a wonnded fighter in the back . 
two weeks ago , Masood was penned up in his Panjsher Valley stronghold some 90 km ( 60 miles ) north of Kabul but hit back with some stunning counter-attacks . 
his latest breakthrough came on Friday when , with the backing of Dostum &apos;s artillery , he took Bagram airbase some 50 km ( 30 miles ) north of Kabul . 
since then he has pushed another 25 km ( 12 miles ) south along the main road in heavy fighting and some of the few people allowed to travel to Kabul from the area say there have been many civilian casualties .
