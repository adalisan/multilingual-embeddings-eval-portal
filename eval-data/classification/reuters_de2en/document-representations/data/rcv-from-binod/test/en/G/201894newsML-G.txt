the Atlanta braves kept baseball &apos;s best rotation intact Wednesday by re-signing right-hander John Smoltz , the National League CY Young winner , to a four-year contract with a club option for a fifth season . 
financial terms were not disclosed , but various reports have said the deal is worth $ 31 million , making Smoltz , who was a free agent , the highest paid pitcher ever . 
&quot; I &apos;m obviously excited that everything has fallen into place , &quot; Smoltz said . 
&quot; It &apos;s tremendous to play here for a potential five more years in the new stadium . 
&quot; We wanted to be patient and we wanted to do the right thing . 
this , in my mind , is the right thing . 
my main goal was to be with a winner , and my priority was to be here . 
Smoltz is part of a dominant rotation that includes Greg Maddux , Tom Glavine and Denny Neagle . 
Smoltz &apos;s CY Young Award this season snapped a string of four straight by Maddux after Glavine won the award in 1991 . 
the 29-year-old Smoltz was baseball &apos;s premier pitcher in 1996 , leading the major leagues with 24 wins and 276 strikeouts while compiling a 2.94 ERA . 
his career-high win total was six more than any other N.L. 
pitcher and he led the league in winning percentage ( 24-8 , .750 ) and innings pitched ( 253 2 / 3 ) . 
the right-hander continued his dominance in the postseason , going 4-1 with an 0.95 earned run average in five starts . 
he was also the starting and winning pitcher in the All-Star Game . 
financially , the spectacular season could not have come at a better time for Smoltz , who had never won more than 15 games in eight previous big league seasons . 
the Michigan native , who made $ 5.5 million in 1996 , had indicated all along that he wanted to stay with the defending National League champion braves . 
&quot; We &apos;re delighted to have him back , &quot; braves general manager John Schuerholz said . 
Schuerholz may now try to unload outfielder David Justice in order to pare a big payroll . 
Left-hander Steve Avery , another free agent , is almost sure to leave the braves . 
Schuerholz must deal with the upcoming free agencies of Glavine and Maddux . 
&quot; We take one step at a time , &quot; Scheurholz said . 
&quot; The pressing matter was John &apos;s situation . 
we take care of things as we need to . 
&quot; There will be no changes how our team operates , &quot; team president Stan Kasten said . 
&quot; We will keep doing what we &apos;ve been doing to win and continue to have championship teams . 
Smoltz lost his first start in 1996 , then won 14 straight decisions before a loss to St Louis in late June . 
his 24 wins were the most by a braves pitcher since the franchise moved to Atlanta in 1966 . 
Smoltz has a remarkable 9-2 career record in the postseason . 
his one loss last October was an epic 1-0 battle with the New York Yankees &apos; Andy Pettitte in Game 5 of the World Series . 
Smoltz was a near-unanimous choice for the CY Young , receiving 26 first-place votes and 136 points from a panel of members of the baseball Writers Association of America . 
the braves acquired Smoltz from the Detroit Tigers in August of 1987 for pitcher Doyle Alexander . 
Smoltz was bothered by arm problems for several years but he underwent surgery in September 1994 and says that he did not regain full strength until prior to the 1996 season . 
Smoltz and outfielder Albert belle were the prized free agents available this off-season . 
belle left the Cleveland Indians Tuesday to sign with the Chicago White SOx for the richest baseball contract ever , $ 55 million for five years .
