the Sri Lanka rupee closed barely moved after crawling in a tight range as dealers went to the Central Bank for dollars . 
the rupee finished at its previous closing level of 57.16 to the dollar , after opening at 57.13 . 
&quot; The range for the day was between 57.14 and 57.16 , with many imports being covered with dollars from the Central Bank when the exchange rate went near the top end , &quot; said a Standard Chartered Bank dealer . 
since the Central Bank left the exchange rate unchanged , buying and selling prices remained at 56.0291 and 57.1610 . 
with little happening overseas to lead the Central Bank to change the dollar-rupee aggressively , the exchange rate should remain at current levels for some time , dealers said . 
&quot; Given the current international scenario and barring anything unforseen , the rate should be around the same level , &quot; said a Citibank dealer . 
overnight call money closed at 15 percent after opening at 16 , due to the marekt being well offered , dealers said .
