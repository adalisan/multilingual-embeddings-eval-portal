the sizzling rally in world coffee prices appears overdone and London robusta futures were expected to retreat by between US $ 50 and $ 130 a tonne on profit-taking , Asian traders said on Thursday . 
they New York arabica prices were expected to follow suit in profit-taking later in the day , they said . 
&quot; The rally is way too much overdone . 
it &apos;s due $ 120 down , &quot; the chief coffee dealer for a U.S. commodity trading house said . 
another trader for a European commodity house said : &quot; Nothing lasts forever . 
we should see it go down about $ 55- $ 130 . 
very tight supplies of coffee in Latin America and low stocks in consuming countries have sparked the rally . 
London &apos;s benchmark May robusta contract soared on Wednesday to a new nine-month high of $ 1,820 a tonne before late profit-taking knocked it back down to $ 1,780 , up $ 82 on the day . 
new York May rallied to a 2-1 / 2 year peak at 209.50 U.S. cents a lb prior to settling at 200.65 cents . 
U.S. coffee prices have now gained 30 cents , or 17 percent , over the last four days . 
&quot; Some sort of correction is reasonable to expect , &quot; a European trader said , adding that the pattern of &quot; forced liquidation &quot; seen in New York and London towards the end of trading on Wednesday may again be seen later on Thursday . 
&quot; New York went up much faster than London so New York will go down much faster than London , &quot; another dealer said . 
some speculative fund managers appear to have decided to decide to cash in their profits , one trader said . 
&apos; The next guy decided to take their profits and this seems to have spread , &quot; he said . 
some traders said any correction may be mild and short-lived as the bullish fundamentals of the coffee market remained intact . 
&quot; We still have the same huge shortage of coffee coming up over the next 1-1 / 2 years , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t count on a big correction , the way the market has been behaving the past few days , &quot; another coffee trader said .
