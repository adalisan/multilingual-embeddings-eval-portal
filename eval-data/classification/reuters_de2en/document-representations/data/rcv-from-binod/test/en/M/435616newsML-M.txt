Lithuania &apos;s stock exchange said on Wednesday it would set up an official list of the bourse &apos;s top companies in the next two weeks . 
&quot; In the next two weeks we will form the bourse &apos;s official list , &quot; the director of Lithuania &apos;s stock exchange , Rimantas Busila , told Reuters in an interview . 
some 460 companies are currently listed on Lithuania &apos;s stock exchange , with 35 on the A list of most actively traded stock . 
Busila said he was awaiting international audit figures before a final decision would be made about the list . 
&quot; It is absolutely clear which companies could be on the official list and the only obstacle which delays the final decision are the international audit results of the financial activity , which are expected soon , &quot; Busila said . 
&quot; Preliminary conclusions of the audit in all the companies which are candidates for the list are positive , &quot; Busila said . 
Vilniaus and Hermis banks , packaging company Medienos Plaushas and dairy Rokishkis cheese are the top candidates , Busila said , adding that this group would grow . 
&quot; I think that the official list will expand and we expect there will be around ten comapnies on the list before year-end , &quot; Busila said . 
he declined to name other candidates . 
in order to make the official list , companies must have been stable and profitable over the last three years , and the company &apos;s share capital must be no less than five million litas , Busila said . 
a company also must have been listed on the bourse for at least six months and accounting must heed international standards , Busila said .
