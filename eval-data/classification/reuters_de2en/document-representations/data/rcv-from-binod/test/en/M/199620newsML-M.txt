Mexican stocks fell for the fourth straight session Tuesday , hurt by investor interest in the U.S. markets , traders and analysts said . 
&quot; The market is very quiet again . 
foreign investors have yet to step in , I think they &apos;re still wary of Mexico due to political factors and because the Dow is still rallying , &quot; said Daniel Romo , equity analyst at the Bancrecer financial group . 
volume was a lackluster 72.5 million shares . 
the Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.69 points to 6,397.60 , its 40th record close this year . 
&quot; As long as the party goes on in New York , they won &apos;t even turn to look at us , and unless they do , things here won &apos;t change , &quot; said a floor trader . 
although stocks closed down , they were off lows and respected resistance at 3,350 points , analysts noted . 
&quot; It rebounded near support again , and the winter rally could begin from these levels , &quot; Romo said . 
a total of 104 stocks were traded , of which losers outnumbered gainers by 50 to 28 . 
financial stock Abacogf A series headed the gainers , up 20 ( $ 0.03 ) centavos to 2.80 pesos ( $ 0.35 ) , but at moderate trade , dealers noted . 
small autoparts maker Iasasa A series shares headed the losers , down four centavos ( $ 0.01 ) to 41 ( $ 0.05 ) , but at minimal volume .
