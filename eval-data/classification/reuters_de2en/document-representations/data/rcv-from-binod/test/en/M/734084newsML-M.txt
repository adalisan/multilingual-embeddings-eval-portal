copper prices slid to a key support level and cash to threes backwardation contracted sharply as London Metal Exchange ( LME ) stocks soared by a whopping 17,025 tonnes on Wednesday morning . 
the other metals were also weaker with copper , with lead trading some $ 45 down from Monday &apos;s high and tin probing fresh 2-1 / 3 year lows . 
flagship three months copper was last quoted at $ 2,263 / 2,268 per tonne , compared to Tuesday &apos;s kerb close of $ 2,278 . 
but traders noted that prices had bounced from a low of $ 2,247 despite the dampening effect of the inventory hike . 
&quot; It &apos;s lost quite a bit of ground and prices should hold here for the time being , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; If the support holds people will come in and buy again . 
but watch out if $ 2,250 goes . 
even more dramatically , the cash / threes backwardation nipped in sharply to $ 190 / $ 200 , some $ 60 narrower than at Tuesday &apos;s kerb close . 
&quot; As we ease into the July period where the squeeze dates are , the less the backwardation will be and the more pressure will be put on the market , &quot; the trader said . 
analysts said the stock hike was attributable in large part to the flaring backwardation attracting metal . 
big deliveries had also been expected from the Far East into LME warehouses in Singapore , and some metal was clearly being redirected from the COMEX warehouses into LME warehouse . 
in other markets , aluminum was actively sold down in early business , bottoming out just below the $ 1,550 support level , traders said . 
it was last trading at $ 1,554 , down from $ 1,563 , after LME stocks decreased by 1,100 tonnes . 
lead , which was hit by stop loss selling in late Tuesday trading , was last quoted at $ 629 / $ 631 , compared to the previous kerb close of $ 638 and Monday &apos;s high of $ 674.50 . 
technically , lead &apos;s next target was $ 625 . 
&quot; However , it would take a breach of the recent lows of $ 613 / 615 to re-establish a downwards trend , &quot; brokers Brandeis said in a commentary . 
tin also crumbled below important support at $ 5,490 to hit fresh lows since March 1995 . 
last trading at $ 5,450 / 5,470 , tin was seen vulnerable to further losses targetting $ 5,420 . 
nickel maintained its recent quiet tone , shedding just $ 10 to trade at $ 6,865 . 
Alloy was little changed , straddling support , at $ 1,410 / 1,420 .
