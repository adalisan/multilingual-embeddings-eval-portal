England &apos;s batsmen dug in on the third morning of the inaugural test against Zimbabwe at Queen &apos;s Club to reach 128 for two at lunch . 
resuming at 48 for one , the tourists lost the wicket of Nick Knight before the interval as they replied to Zimbabwe &apos;s first innings total of 376 . 
Knight reached a fluent half century before falling lbw to a good slower ball from paceman Henry Olonga for 56 from 80 balls with nine boundaries . 
but the left-hander &apos;s dismissal stemmed the flow of runs as leg-spinner Paul Strang troubled all the batsmen with his clever variations . 
he bowled 12 overs for 19 runs and was unlucky not to pick up a couple of wickets . 
Nasser Hussain was particularly fortunate to survive against Strang , being dropped off a sharp chance to short leg first ball and given the benefit of the doubt when the next delivery prompted a good lbw shout . 
at lunch Alec Stewart was on 29 with Hussain on 12 .
