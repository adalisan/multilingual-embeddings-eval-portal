Japan &apos;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry will look into rumours in the financial markets that industrial output data , released on Friday , were leaked before the announcement , a MITI official said . 
&quot; If the data were actually leaked , we will look into the matter and will take proper measures to prevent it from happening again , &quot; the official told Reuters . 
operators in Japan &apos;s bond markets said figures for July industrial production and forecasts for August and September output circulated in the markets about 10-15 minutes before the announcement of the data at 3.30 p.m. ( 0630 GMT ) . 
the ministry announced industrial production in July rose 4.1 percent month-on-month , and also said output by major manufacturers is expected to fall 1.2 percent in August but rise 0.1 percent in September . 
&quot; The figures in the markets were exactly the same as those that the ministry announced , &quot; one dealer said . 
but the MITI official said the ministry kept the information under tight control and he did not think a leak was possible .
