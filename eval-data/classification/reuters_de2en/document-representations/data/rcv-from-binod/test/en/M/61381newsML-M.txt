local institutions and retail players took profits after two straight days of gains , pushing blue chips lower at the close , analysts said . 
the blue-chip composite Index slipped 6.14 points to close at 1,128.74 while the Second Board Index closed up 4.45 points at 599.16 
volumes were again high , with 309.5 million shares traded , valued at 2.7 billion ringgit . 
&quot; Local funds were taking some profits today , but the market was still being supported by foreign institutional funds , &quot; said a local analyst . 
Audrey Ho , head of research at Mohaiyani Securities said : &quot; We view the profit taking as a healthy sign . 
share scrip deliveries after heavy trading eight days ago contributed to the downward pressure , she said . 
Ho also said that foreign institutional funds were seen selectively &quot; nibbling &quot; at blue-chip stocks . 
YTL Corp was up 40 cents at 13.20 ringgit after posting a 57.5 percent gain in net profits for the year ended June 30 , 1996 . 
second board volumes constituted roughly 45 percent of total volumes , suggesting reduced retail interest , said Ho .
