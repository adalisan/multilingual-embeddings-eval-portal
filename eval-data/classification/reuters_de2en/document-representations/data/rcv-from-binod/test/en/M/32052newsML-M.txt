blue-chip stocks ended with small gains Wednesday as Wall Street reacted calmly to news of the second U.S. military strike against Iraqi targets and focused on Friday &apos;s jobs data for clues to the Federal Reserve &apos;s interest rate policy . 
the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 8.51 points at 5,656.90 . 
in the broader market , advancing issues led declines 1,370 to 927 on moderate volume of 351 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
&quot; At the present time both stocks and bonds are acting antsy about Friday &apos;s news , &quot; said Harry Laubscher , market analyst at Tucker Anthony . 
&quot; Investors are largely on the sidelines in advance of the jobs data . 
the new round of missile attacks by the United States against Iraq early Wednesday continued to roil limited segments of the market , though oil stocks were only barely higher on the day . 
traders said the U.S. military intervention had largely faded as a market-moving factor , and most investors shifted to upcoming economic data , such as Friday &apos;s jobs report that is expected to help the Fed decide whether to raise or keep interest rates unchanged . 
analysts on average expect non-farm payrolls to rise by 224,000 in August compared with July &apos;s 193,000 increase , while the unemployment rate is seen edging lower to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent . 
in the bond market , the 30-year Treasury bond was off 16 / 32 and its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , rose to 7.10 percent from 7.06 percent at Tuesday &apos;s close . 
the energy-hungry transportation sector was weak and the shares of airline companies were battered by the prospect that higher fuel prices will hurt their results . 
crude oil prices ended 16 cents lower at $ 23.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after soaring $ 1.15 Tuesday on the United Nations &apos; decision to call off the sale by Iraq of 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per day of oil following Baghdad &apos;s military incursion into northern Iraqi Kurdistan . 
despite the pullback , oil prices have gained about $ 1 this week and are nearly $ 6 above year-ago levels . 
retail stocks got a boost from news that office product retailer staples Inc. agreed to acquire competitor Office depot Inc. in a deal that creates an industry giant with more than $ 10 billion in annual sales . 
office depot jumped 4-5 / 8 to 20-1 / 2 , while staples , which will pay 1.14 shares for each Office depot share , fell 3 / 4 to 18-3 / 4 . 
the deal sparked strong demand for retail stocks . 
J.C. Penney Co. gained 1-7 / 8 to 55-1 / 2 , May Department Stores Co. rose 1-3 / 8 to 47-1 / 2 and sears Roebuck &amp; Co. rose 1-1 / 8 to 44-3 / 4 . 
&quot; You &apos;ve had concern in that sector about too many competitors and margin erosion , &quot; said Philip Orlando , chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management . 
&quot; This deal suggests managements recognise the potential problem and are going to enact the strategic consolidation that is needed . 
one stock that failed to participate in the retail rally was OfficeMax Inc . , which slipped 5 / 8 to 13-1 / 8 . 
the company , a direct competitor of staples and Office depot , said it may pursue acquisitions of its own in light of the merger . 
Rubbermaid Inc. fell 3-5 / 8 to 22-7 / 8 after warning that its third quarter earnings would be hurt by rising raw materials prices . 
the company also said it agreed to buy Graco Children &apos;s Products Inc. for $ 320 million in cash . 
the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.53 points to 1,143.82 . 
the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.89 to 655.61 . 
the American Stock Exchange index dipped 0.45 to 557.34 . 
the NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks rose 1.61 to 352.37 . 
the average share was up 6 cents . 
the Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE , American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,454.798 , up 10.114 , or 0.16 percent .
