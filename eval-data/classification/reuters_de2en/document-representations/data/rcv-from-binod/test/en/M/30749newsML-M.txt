the Philippine call loan rate jumped to 11.5625 percent on Tuesday from 10.3125 following a rise in Central Bank overnight rates , dealers said . 
the interbank rate peaked at 12.53125 percent after the Central Bank raised its overnight borrowing rate to 11.5 percent from 10.25 . 
the Central Bank also increased its lending rate to 13.5 percent from 12.75 . 
traders said they see the high peso rates as temporary on hopes of a further slide in August inflation numbers , which are due to be released on Thursday . 
the Central Bank used its overnight rates to curb any speculation in the foreign exchange market and to siphon off liquidity from the market . 
the peso ended sharply down at 26.265 on Monday from 26.211 following a fall in overnight money and treasury bill rates . 
&quot; The market is now awash with cash as banks refused to use the reverse repo facility of the Central Bank , &quot; said one dealer . 
banks continued to shy away from reverse repos in protest at a new rule requiring them to reveal buyers so the government can check if the necessary taxes have been paid . 
secondary trading of government securities remained active . 
the three-month bills were at 11.7 percent , six-month bills at 12 percent , and one-year bills at 12.6 percent .
