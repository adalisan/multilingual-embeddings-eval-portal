Latin America offers a wealth of trade opportunities for Asia and the two rapidly growing regions must try to forge stronger economic links , Thai officials and Latin diplomats said on Tuesday . 
&quot; For Asian countries , especially Thailand , Latin America is increasingly considered as an inviting source of raw materials and as a market of untold promise , &quot; Thai Foreign Minister Amnuay Viravan told a seminar on investment opportunities in Latin America . 
Amnuay and ambassadors from several Latin American nations told the government-sponsored seminar that while trade between Thailand and Latin America was still relatively small , it had been rising sharply over the past few years . 
&quot; From 1985 to 1995 , the trade volume between Thailand and Latin America has risen five fold , &quot; Amnuay said . 
&quot; But in absolute terms that is not nearly enough , given the considerable potential for closer economic partnership between us . 
ambassadors from several countries said their bilateral trade with Thailand had grown an average 130-to-150 percent over the past year . 
&quot; It &apos;s not very big in absolute terms , &quot; Argentine Ambassador Jesus Fernando Taboada told Reuters . 
&quot; But we &apos;re working to change that . 
look at this seminar -- it &apos;s a sign the ( Thai ) Foreign Ministry has a lot of interest in Latin America . 
Latin America and Southeast Asia comprise some of the fastest growing economies in the world . 
Peru &apos;s ambassador to Thailand , Oscar Maurtura de Romana , compared his country to the &quot; Asian Tigers &quot; that have seen such rapid growth over the past decade . 
&quot; It is my country , Peru , that is striving to become an &apos; Andean Tiger &apos; , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We share with our Asian counterparts a commitment to growth , development , productivity and hard work . 
needless to say , we are beginning to roar . 
Maurtura said Latin America was attractive to investors for its minerals and natural resources . 
as infrastructure demand continues to rise in Asia , so would its need for raw materials that could be provided by Latin American exporters . 
high-level government visits between the regions had increased over the past few months , diplomats said , a sign of the growing importance of Asian-Latin American links . 
Argentine president Carlos Menem just completed a visit to Malaysia and Indonesia during which he called for improved trade links between the seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) and the South American common market , Mercosur . 
Mercosur comprises Argentina , Brazil , Uruguay and Paraguay , with Chile as an associate member . 
Thailand was already Southeast Asia &apos;s biggest importer from Brazil , said Ambassador Arnaldo Carrilho . 
&quot; Last year , the value of our merchandise exports ( fob ) to the Thai market amounted to $ 419 million , one quarter of the total exported to the six other ASEAN nations , &quot; he said . 
Amnuay said it was time for Thailand to branch out from its traditional economic partners in Asia , Europe and North America . 
&quot; With continued efforts at economic integration within and between the two regions , I believe Asia and Latin America will carry great weight in international economic affairs , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We should , therefore , take advantage of this opportunity to expand our trade and investment cooperation , and bridge the gaps which have too long separated us , &quot; Amnuay said .
