the Mexican peso pared earlier advances against the dollar at the close on Thursday as dealers took advantage of peso strength to cover short dollar positions , traders said . 
&quot; The dollar was well oversold in the morning as the market took advantage of euphoria in the wake of Wednesday &apos;s strong GDP figures , &quot; a trader said . 
the benchmark 48-hour peso and the 24-hour contract closed 0.15 and 0.8 centavo firmer , respectively , at 7.7625 / 7.7650 and 7.7535 / 7.7560 per dollar . 
same-day peso contracts had closed earlier 4.4 centavos firmer at 7.7390 / 7.7410 per dollar , after lagging the market . 
dealers said earlier peso firmness was also due to new measures announced by Banco de Mexico on Wednesday which aim to prevent excessive market volatility . 
one mechanism provided for the central bank to hold one auction of $ 300 million in dollar puts in the middle of each month in addition to exisiting auctions held at the end of each month . 
traders said the measure was designed to drain surplus dollars in case the peso became too strong . 
on the other hand , the central bank made it clear it was prepared to inject $ 200 million into the market if the peso should devalue by two percent in a given day . 
dealers were mixed about whether such an amount was sufficient to stabilize a jittery market suffering from a speculative onslaught . 
nonetheless , they noted a two percent swing had not been seen in all of 1996 or to date in 1997 , and felt the expressed intent to do what many suspect the central bank has effectively done in practice would be effective enough . 
&quot; To a certain extent , it is a step towards bringing back the floatation band system , &quot; a trader said , referring to fixed trading bands of the past . 
Banco de Mexico scrapped trading bands on December 21 , 1994 , two days after a raising the top of the band 15 percent led to a run on the peso which depleted international reserves and put Mexico &apos;s ability to meet short-term international debt obligations in question . 
traders said that peso strength may have been sapped by increased yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yields to 6.65 percent , from 6.57 percent on Wednesday .
