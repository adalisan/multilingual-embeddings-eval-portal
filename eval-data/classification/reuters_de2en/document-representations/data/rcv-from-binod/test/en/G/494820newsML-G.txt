President Bill Clinton on Tuesday appeared to rule out U.S. arm-twisting to revive the Middle East peace process , saying it was up to Israel and the Palestinians to get stalled negotiations started again . 
&quot; I want these parties to do what they have to do to get this process up and going again . 
we &apos;ve got to have an atmosphere of zero tolerance for terror , but we &apos;ve also got to have the kind of confidence-building necessary to make peace , &quot; Clinton said . 
the president &apos;s comments to reporters , at a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien , came as Israelis and Palestinians clashed anew after his apparently inconclusive talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . 
Clinton , under pressure from U.S. foreign policy experts and editorial writers to take a firmer stance in the mushrooming crisis , said &quot; the parties have got to do what it takes &quot; to revive the peace process . 
he called the latest outbreak of violence &quot; troubling , &quot; but said it should not be allowed to divert attention from getting the negotiations going again because &quot; that &apos;s the ultimate resolution of all these things . 
Clinton also repeated that he and Netanyahu had &quot; a long , thorough , very frank conversation &quot; on Monday . 
&quot; He &apos;s got some good ideas , and I think we &apos;ve got some good ideas and we want to talk to the Palestinians this week to see if we can get this going again , &quot; he said .
