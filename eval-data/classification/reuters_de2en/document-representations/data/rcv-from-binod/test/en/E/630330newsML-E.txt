Hungarian commercial corporate lending and deposit rates continued to decline in April despite a National Bank of Hungary ( NBH ) interest rate hike at the end of March . 
&quot; The trend of interest rate decline , beginning in the summer of 1995 , did not change in April , &quot; the NBH said in a statement on Monday . 
the NBH said that the average interest rate of commercial bank loans to enterprises , maturing within one year , dropped in April 0.1 percentage point to 22.3 percent . 
as the interest rates of enterprise deposits with maximum one year maturity eased by 0.4 percent to 17.8 percent , the average interest rate margin narrowed by 0.3 percentage points to 4.5 percent , the NBH said . 
these interest rates have dropped since the middle of 1995 from a high of above 33 percent for loans and almost 26 percent for deposits . 
year-on-year consumer inflation has seen almost monthly falls from its peak of 31 percent in June 1995 , and ran at 18.6 percent in April 1997 . 
the average interest rate on interbank overnight and tomorrow-next dealings dropped in April by one percentage point to 21 percent , the NBH said . 
in March , the NBH raised its six-month deposit rate by 0.25 percent to 21 percent , to protect savings following a rapid decline of interest rates in the first months of the year . 
the measure either stabilised or slightly pushed up government securities yields but commercial bank interest rates continued to drop . 
the managers of several commercial banks which held annual meetings recently said that competition for corporate and retail customers was increasing , which led to narrowing interest rate margins .
