aluminium &apos;s physical premiums in Europe have not been bruised much by the seasonal summer slowdown or backwardations on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) , traders said . 
&quot; premiums seem to be holding . 
the back has not been big enough to have an effect on the premiums , &quot; one trader said . 
tightness centred in August pushed the benchmark cash / threes spread into a modest backwardation at certain times this week . 
on Thursday pre-market activity it was indicated nearly level , bid at a $ 2 contango and offered at a $ 3 backwardation . 
Russian A7E aluminium , which is deliverable on the LME , was quoted at a $ 30 / $ 40 premium to LME cash in Rotterdam , down only about $ 5 from its level three weeks ago . 
Western duty-unpaid metal was at a $ 40 / $ 50 premium , also virtually unchanged on the month . 
turnover is very slow , however , especially with futures prices hitting fresh 19-month highs , they added . 
&quot; Not much is being done . 
there was some panic buying when prices shot up , &quot; a trader said , referring to a rally that swept three-month prices $ 100 higher since last week . 
&quot; There are bits and pieces but the market is already expensive , and with the back , the much stronger dollar and the steady premiums , it is killing the rest of the physical activity , &quot; another said . 
&quot; The market is not easing , so consumers are continuing to buy hand to mouth , they are very frustrated , &quot; he added . 
the outlook for the rest of the year is positive with the stronger dollar helping export prospects in continental Europe , one trader there said . 
speculative activity was expected to help underpin prices until industry gears back up in the autumn . 
&quot; If they can keep prices up here during August , then when the consumers come back they &apos;ll have to buy it at the higher levels , &quot; he said . 
another trader said the market would have to wait until after the summer to determine whether the fundamentals were actually supporting the price . 
&quot; The problem is the premiums aren &apos;t going to be tested too much until such time as the real buyers have to come in and pay for material . 
I can &apos;t see anything fundamentally altered in the physical business in the last week , &quot; he said , adding that he believed the three month price would remain in a range capped by about $ 1,700 . 
&quot; I can &apos;t see any justification for a push up to $ 1,800 , but that &apos;s not to say it won &apos;t happen if the funds keep buying .
