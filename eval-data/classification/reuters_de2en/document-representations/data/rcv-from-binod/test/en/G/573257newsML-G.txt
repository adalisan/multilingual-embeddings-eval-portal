the United Nations accused Zairean rebels on Friday of blocking a probe into alleged massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire . 
U.N. investigators and forensic experts had planned to dig up mass graves in a mission seen as a litmus test of rebel leader Laurent Kabila &apos;s willingness to assist human rights investigations . 
but a U.N. statement released in Geneva said the Tutsi-dominated rebels had refused access to the U.N. team to areas they control in eastern Zaire . 
U.N. sources in Rwanda , where the team has been stuck for nearly a week waiting for rebel permission to go to Zaire , said the investigators planned to return to Geneva at the weekend . 
the rebel blockage is an open challenge to the United Nations , whose top human rights body ordered the mission , and to western nations which have condemned the alleged killings and urged Kabila to cooperate with the probe . 
last week , Washington said there were increasingly credible and shocking reports of killings of refugees in rebel-held areas . 
Kabila &apos;s forces control about three-quarters of Zaire and are closing in on the capital , Kinshasa . 
they are vowing to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko unless he resigns . 
a statement from the U.N. mission accused the rebel alliance of trying to be &quot; members of its own jury &quot; by proposing to create its own team of national experts to work with the U.N. team . 
it said the rebels also had serious reservations about the participation in the mission of U.N. rights investigator for Zaire Roberto Garreton , who last month accused the rebels of continuing massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees and civilians . 
the three-member U.N. commission was set up in April upon the demand of Garreton , who said witness reports spoke of up to 50,000 Hutu refugees and civilians killed by the rebels . 
the Hutus are the rump of two million Rwandans who fled to Zaire after Tutsi rebels ended the Hutu-led genocide of minority Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 -- one of the worst mass slaughters of the 20th century . 
ethnic hatred between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes goes back centuries and has repeatedly exploded into bloodshed .
