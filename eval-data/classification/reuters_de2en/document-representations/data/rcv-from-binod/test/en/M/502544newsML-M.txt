* Central Bank seen net buyer of dollars 
the Philippine peso was boosted on Friday by inflows for fixed-income and stock market investments to close at 26.363 from 26.365 , dealers said . 
relatively smaller requirements from oil firms for the day also gave support to the peso , they said . 
the day &apos;s average was at 26.364 from 26.365 , with volume down to $ 148.9 million from $ 193.6 million . 
the peso had weakened to its day-low of 26.37 in early trade due to arbitrage play for the coming weekend . 
banks took about $ 15 million from the Central Bank at 26.37 in exchange for the higher-interest earning pesos for placements at the weekend , traders said . 
as inflows came in , the Central Bank eventually bought about $ 18 to $ 25 million at 26.358 / 26.363 , dealers said . 
&quot; We see a further strengthening of the peso on Monday , &quot; a big bank dealer said , since T-bill rates are expected to rise in the regular auction which would attract more dollar inflows . 
a Reuter poll of five financial institutions projected the bellwether 91-day T-bill rate would rise to 9.93 from 9.583 percent after the Central Bank raised its overnight borrowing rate to 10 from 9.9 percent on Thursday . 
the Central Bank &apos;s action was intended to attract more inflows and mop liquidity from the system , dealers said .
