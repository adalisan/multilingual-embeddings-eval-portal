LIFFE robusta coffee futures shed some gains towards the morning close on Thursday after a firm start in response to a strong showing in New York on Wednesday . 
dealings were again subdued and centred on nearby switch trades . 
traders said both London and New York markets showed further upside potential although London was more likely to rally than New York . 
new York &apos;s run-up on Wednesday was seen purely technical . 
fundamentally , the market could come under pressure from rising U.S. certified stocks . 
LIFFE &apos;s September stepped back slightly after failing to breach the immediate $ 1,850 resistance . 
it finished $ 15 higher at $ 1,840 after a low of $ 1,825 . 
volume was low at 1,549 lots . 
July / Sept switches were traded at $ 20 while Sept / Nov widened to $ 30 from $ 21 . 
new York &apos;s September rallied on Wednesday after hitting buy-stops at 175 cents a lb . 
traders expect a further rise if the contract clears the next resistance at 181 . 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) said on Wednesday it had confidence in its 28-million bag estimate of Brazil &apos;s 1997 / 98 coffee harvest , and that a lower estimate of 24 million by a U.S. agricultural attache did not take into account all factors influencing the crop . 
&quot; We stand by our numbers and the integrity of our system , &quot; said Ed Cissel , director of production estimates and crop assessment for the USDA &apos;s Foreign Agricultural Service . 
Cissel added the attache reports were one of many pieces of information -- including the attache reports , weather , statistical trends and trees planted -- evaluated in preparing an official agency estimate . 
the Association of Coffee producing Countries earlier on Wednesday expressed concern about a four-million bag difference in a pair of recent crop estimates and sought an explanation from the USDA regarding the conflicting figures .
