the Israeli president &apos;s proverbial loud mouth has landed him in trouble again . 
this time Ezer Weizman , a former air force chief with a rough hide and a history of verbal faux pas , has mocked homosexuals , catering to Israeli machismo but angering rights activists and leftwingers . 
his aides were scrambling once more to dislodge their boss &apos;s foot from his mouth . 
&quot; The president will meet with a respectable delegation of homosexuals and lesbians on Monday and I think things will be clarified , &quot; said Weizman &apos;s office director , Arieh Shumer . 
but pressed on the president &apos;s reaction to the tempest his remarks stirred , Shumer said : &quot; He doesn &apos;t retract his statements . 
Weizman , whose presidential role is largely symbolic and void of political power , sparked the ruckus in a rambling response to a question during a speech to high school students . 
&quot; ( Homosexuality ) is abnormal from a social point of view . 
what the public decides to do with ( homosexuals ) , it will decide through laws , &quot; Weizman said , drawing applause from students . 
the cheers turned to giggles as Weizman used an inflection to deride homosexuality . 
&quot; It has become &apos; nice &apos; , &quot; the president said , his voice rising in tone . 
he repeated the word &apos; nice &apos; in an even higher pitch . 
rabbis lauded Weizman , who is expected to seek reelection in 1998 , but hundreds of Israelis protested outside his Jerusalem home on Saturday and demanded his resignation . 
&quot; It grants legitimacy to illegal attacks , to incitement , it invalidates a whole section of the public which under the law is equal in every way . 
the president of Israel is delegitimising this group , &quot; said legislator Yael Dayan . 
Weizman , the nephew of Israel &apos;s first president Chaim Weizmann , took office in 1993 after an illustrious military career and 15 years in politics . 
he helped forge the country &apos;s historic peace accord with Egypt in 1979 and served as a cabinet minister in successive Israeli governments in the 1980s -- all the while notorious for his abrasive candour . 
in 1994 , he outraged women &apos;s groups when , commenting on one woman &apos;s quest to become an air force pilot , Weizman said a woman &apos;s place was in the home . 
he has incensed politicians from left and right with pronouncements considered inappropriate for a president . 
earlier this year he compared Islamic guerrillas fighting Israeli troops in Lebanon to Nazis . 
radio news shows buzzed with talk of Weizman &apos;s latest slip , but not all the voices were negative . 
&quot; Certainly they ( homosexuals ) are doing things that are abnormal and abnormality should be condemned , &quot; Chief Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron told Israel &apos;s army radio . 
&quot; From a humane , biblical and Jewish standpoint ( homosexuality ) is a bad thing , a profane thing , and this should be stated out loud , &quot; he said . 
a former Weizman aide , now a member of Israel &apos;s main gay rights organisation , said the president had gone too far . 
&quot; It hurts me to see how this man has deteriorated . 
it almost makes me say this is not the same person who was elected president , &quot; Menahem Shaizaf told Israel Radio . 
&quot; His ignorance simply amazes me .
