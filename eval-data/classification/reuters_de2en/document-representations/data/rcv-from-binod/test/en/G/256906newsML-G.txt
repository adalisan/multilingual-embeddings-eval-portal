troops sealed all entrances to the largest refugee camp in northwestern Tanzania and stopped vehicles using the road to the Rwandan border on Saturday , preparing for refugees to return to Rwanda . 
Tanzanian soldiers turned back all vehicles trying to reach Benaco camp , 17 km ( 11 miles ) east of the border with Rwanda , and barred officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . 
before the security clampdown in the border area aid workers said they expected large numbers of the 540,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania to return to Rwanda on Saturday . 
UNHCR said on Friday Tanzanian authorities had ruled that no Rwandan refugees would be allowed to remain in their camps in northwestern Tanzania after troops and police turned round hundreds of thousands of refugees trying to trek into the bush . 
thousands of heavily armed troops surrounded Benaco camp overnight after long lines of refugees rushed past stick-wielding soldiers and back into the camp they had fled only hours earlier . 
hundreds of thousands of refugees slept in Benaco and a smaller satellite camp and on roads back to the camps under army guard after failing in their bid to flee deeper into Tanzania since last Sunday . 
&quot; The operation is now completely in the hands of the Tanzanian military , &quot; said UNHCR official Anne Willem Bijleveld , adding he believed refugees would soon be ordered by Tanzanian authorities to return to Rwanda , which they fled in 1994 . 
the UNHCR opposes the forced repatriation of the refugees from Tanzania but first aid stations and water points have been prepared by aid agencies on the route to the border and were staffed round-the-clock from Friday . 
it was unclear what would happen to Hutu hardline militiamen and troops who refuse to go back to Rwanda as they face jail for their part in the genocide of an estimated 800,000 people in 1994 . 
there are also 112,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania . 
soldiers beat refugees at Benaco with sticks on Friday but gave up when it was clear they could not keep them out of Benaco . 
troops also fired teargas canisters and shot in the air to keep the refugees on the road back towards the border . 
the UNHCR said 1,463 refugees voluntarily returned on Friday , bringing the total number to go back to 7,224 since a Tanzanian government deadline of December 31 was set last week for all Rwandan refugees in northwestern Tanzania to go home . 
refugees started leaving the camps last Sunday , saying they were on a marathon trek to asylum in Kenya or as far south as Malawi , 850 km ( 530 miles ) away , to avoid being forced home . 
the exodus had threatened a repeat of events in Zaire in November when over half-a-million Rwandan Hutus fleeing a revolt by Zairean rebels left camps to return to Rwanda while many others fled or were driven by Hutu militia deeper into Zaire . 
Tanzania and UNHCR announced the refugees should go home by the end of this month in the hope of a mass return because of the momentum generated by the move from Zaire . 
but the human rights group Amnesty International and a Hutu refugee lobby group said it amounted to forced repatriation .
