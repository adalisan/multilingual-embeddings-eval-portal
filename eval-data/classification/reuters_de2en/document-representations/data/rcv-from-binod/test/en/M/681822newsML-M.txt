Hong Kong &apos;s blue-chip Hang Seng Index surged to a new all-time high in early trade on Monday , before running into profit-taking and reversing course . 
following through on a record-breaking rally on Friday , the Hang Seng Index jumped 167.97 points , or 1.11 percent , to an all-time high of 15,322.33 points in early trade as investors remained bullish on the market &apos;s tone over the handover period . 
profit-taking then kicked in to bring the market down 60.62 points , or 0.40 percent , to 15,093.74 by late morning . 
&quot; Local profit-taking emerged following the sharp rally , &quot; said Michael ng , a dealing director at Sassoon Securities . 
he said he welcomed a healthy correction following Friday &apos;s surge of 647.87 points to new record ground . 
but in this final week before Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule , analysts said the market should remain well supported by mainland liquidity flows and the prospects of further economic integration with China . 
the range for the week was expected to be 15,000 to 15,500 points . 
&quot; People are bullish for two reasons , &quot; said Kelvin Tang , an analyst at ImPac Asset Management . 
&quot; One is the inflow of money from China and , secondly , the economic outlook for China will benefit Hong Kong . 
we have seen the Chinese economy improve over the last year . 
the red chip Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index was down 73.05 points , or 2.34 percent , at 3,054.82 . 
analysts said China &apos;s move on Friday to tighten its hold on red chips and future asset injections could dampen sentiment in the sector in the short-term but would provide a healthier environment by reducing excessive speculation on the stocks . 
China &apos;s State Council said Chinese-controlled companies making share offers abroad must obtain approval from domestic regulators . 
government approval would be required for asset transfers to Chinese-controlled companies abroad if the purpose was to inject the assets into a listed vehicle . 
&quot; The major red chips will be alright because they have got good ( government ) connections , &quot; said Alex Wong , technical analyst at Dharmala Securities .
