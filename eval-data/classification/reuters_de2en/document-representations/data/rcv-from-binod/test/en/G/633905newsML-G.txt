a lawyer for President Clinton and Hillary Clinton Tuesday accused Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr of flouting legal ethics with a public relations blitz aimed at damaging the Clintons . 
in a blistering six-page letter , David Kendall cited legal principles that he said were violated by Starr and his associates in cooperating with the author of an article that appeared this week in the Sunday New York Times Magazine . 
&quot; The course you have chosen is unprecedented and profoundly ill-advised for a number of different but mutually reinforcing reasons , &quot; Kendall said in a letter to Starr . 
citing the &quot; truly awesome might &quot; given to an independent counsel , he said Starr had a responsibility &quot; to conduct grand jury investigations fairly so that the reputations of those investigated but not charged will not be besmirched . 
he charged that the article contained &quot; plain violations of grand jury secrecy , &quot; noting references it contained to closed-door legal proceedings by the jury into the billing records of Mrs. Clinton when she was an attorney in Arkansas . 
&quot; Grand jury secrecy rules are aimed at preventing precisely this kind of leak-and-smear damage , &quot; Kendall complained . 
he urged Starr to &quot; abandon your public relations offensive , get on with your investigation in the manner of previous independent counsels , and bring it to a speedy conclusion . 
White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said Kendall discussed the letter with Clinton , who &quot; agrees with the sentiments expressed . 
the letter was the latest step in an unusual public debate by lawyers dealing with allegations involving Clinton . 
on Sunday , a separate set of lawyers debated on television programmes the merits of a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton by Paula Jones , a former Arkansas state employee . 
the lengthy article in the New York Times was written by Jeffrey Rosen , legal affairs editor of the New Republic and a constitutional law expert who teaches at George Washington University Law School . 
Kendall , citing federal laws and Justice Department guidelines prohibiting federal prosecutors from disclosing matters before a grand jury , told Starr &quot; the comments of you and persons in your office , directly and indirectly quoted in the magazine article , flout all these obligations . 
&quot; Perhaps most troubling are the plain violations of grand jury secrecy &quot; contained in the article , which offered as attribution unnamed prosecutors , he said . 
he cited as an example a passage in the article that dealt with possible obstruction of justice by Mrs. Clinton involving her billing records when she was a lawyer in Arkansas . 
the records had been subpoenaed by federal investigators but disappeared . 
they later were found by a White House aide who was clearing items from the private residence of the White House . 
Mrs. Clinton was forced to testify last year before a grand jury in Washington about her billing records .
