U.K. spot natural gas prices closed slightly stronger in the first quarter 1998 and in the gas year from October on Friday , traders and brokers said , although the market was generally quiet . 
winter prices softened , with trade done in Q1 98 at 16.85 pence a therm . 
but levels later recovered , and by the close Q1 was reported by a broker to be bid at 16.925 pence a therm against an offer at 17.00 pence . 
&quot; It &apos;s been all over the place , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; The numbers keep changing hour by hour . 
the gas year was also done at least twice at 13.00 pence a therm , after closing at 12.90 / 12.95 pence on Thursday , but most other periods were relatively quiet . 
&quot; Everyone &apos;s just sick of it at the moment , &quot; said a trader . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very hard market to get anything done in . 
IPE prices were weaker in the winter but firmer next summer . 
the contract closed before the rally on OTC winter prices which brought spot winter prices back up late in the day .
