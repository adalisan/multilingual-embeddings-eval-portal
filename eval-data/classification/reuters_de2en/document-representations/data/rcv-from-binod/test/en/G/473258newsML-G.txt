Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held separate meetings with Arab-American and Jewish-American leaders Wednesday and heard strong words from both groups about the crisis in Mideast peacemaking . 
Jewish leaders said afterward they supported Albright in her call for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to make a vigorous statement giving an unambiguous &quot; red light &quot; to anti- Israel attacks by militant Palestinians . 
Arab leaders , on the other hand , told reporters Washington was focusing unfairly on Arafat . 
it was time for the United States to &quot; toughen &quot; its stance on Israel and insist the Jewish state halt plans to build a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem , they said . 
Albright called the groups to the State Department as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross flew to the region for talks with Arafat in Morocco and with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel . 
the State Department said Ross was carrying messages from President Bill Clinton for both leaders in his latest effort to defuse tensions and get peace talks back on track . 
Ross would return to Washington by the weekend to report to Clinton on his discussions , spokesman John Dinger said . 
U.S. officials said the decision was made to send Ross to the Middle East after Albright spoke to Arafat by telephone on Tuesday night while she was travelling back to Washington from a day spent in North Carolina with Republican Sen. Jesse Helms , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . 
Mideast tensions are once again on tenterhooks after Netanyahu &apos;s recent decision to proceed with a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem and a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv by militant Palestinians . 
Netanyahu has accused Arafat of giving militants a &quot; green light &quot; to launch attacks on the Jewish state . 
that was very much on the minds of the Jewish-American leaders , who said they were satisfied with Albright &apos;s comments on the issue . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been told by the secretary that she told Arafat in no uncertain terms that on the subject of the green light ... they told Arafat that &apos; now &apos;s the time to show a red light and to get the violence that is occurring to stop , &apos; &quot; said Leon Levy , head of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish-American Organisations , which encompasses 53 groups . 
Jewish leaders also raised the matter of Arafat releasing from prison men accused of commiting violent acts against Israel , a move that &quot; shocked the people of Israel and only created fuel for possible additional violence , &quot; Levy said . 
but while Levy was able to clearly articulate what he said was the U.S. message to Arafat , when asked the U.S. message to Netanyahu , he told reporters : &quot; This was not discussed . 
the leaders said they agreed &quot; we want to see an end to the violence ( and ) we believe that Mr. Arafat must be held accountable &quot; and they were reassured by Albright on this . 
Arab-American leaders were less satisfied with the U.S. position . 
James Zogby of the Arab American Institute said his group was concerned the United States was pinning the blame on Arafat and expressed these concerns to Albright . 
&quot; The act of violence that took place was condemnable and we condemn it but we do not believe Chairman Arafat gave a green light . 
to the contrary , we believe he has made it very clear about how he responds to terrorism , &quot; Zogby said . 
he and other leaders said the Americans have stressed a &quot; perception &quot; in the Middle East that Arafat gave a green light to Palestinian militants and Arafat must now make the extra effort to send a strong red light against violence . 
but Arab-American leaders said the United States has created its own &quot; perception &quot; in the Arab world that it supports the new Israeli settlements because it failed to insist that Israel halt the construction and because it twice vetoed U.N. resolutions condeming the settlements . 
the fact is that at some point the United States has to manifest its own interests and ... be able to say to the Israelis ... you must stop that &quot; settlement activity , Zogby said .
