Indonesia , home to the world &apos;s largest Moslem population , started a major airlift on Saturday to send 200,000 pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the annual Haj , airline and airport officials said . 
&quot; We have started sending the pilgrims to Saudi Arabia . 
one flight from Jakarta Halim Perdana Kusuma airport has taken off , &quot; an airport official told Reuters . 
an official from the state airline PT Garuda Indonesia , which transported the pilgrims , said there would be a total of 474 flights originating from six cities in Indonesia to send the people to Saudi Arabia . 
he said the airlifts would continue until April 10 and the pilgrims would start to fly back to Indonesia on April 22 . 
the official said Garuda would use 24 wide-bodied aircraft to transport the pilgrims to Saudi Arabia . 
devout Moslems make the Haj , or pilgrimage to the holy Saudi city of Mecca , at least once in their lifetime . 
around 85 percent of Indonesia &apos;s more than 200 million people are Moslem . 
at least 580 of Indonesia &apos;s 195,000 pilgrims died during last year &apos;s Haj , most of them because of illness .
