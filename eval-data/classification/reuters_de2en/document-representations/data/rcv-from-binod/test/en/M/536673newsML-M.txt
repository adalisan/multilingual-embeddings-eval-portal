the Federal Reserve was expected to add reserves to the banking system during its usual midmorning intervention period Thursday , perhaps via 14-day fixed-term repurchase agreements , economists said . 
on Wednesday the Fed entered the system twice , the first time it had done so since announcing late last year it would exercise its option to do so any time it felt such operations were warranted .

fed funds were trading at 5-1 / 2 percent , right at the Fed &apos;s current official target range .
