Zairean rebels rejected on Wednesday diplomatic pressure for a ceasefire , saying their forces were pushing on towards a showdown at the garrison city of Kisangani . 
&quot; Kisangani is in our grip and we are putting constant pressure on the town . 
the people are waiting for us and it will soon be over , &quot; Raphael Ngenda , rebel information commissioner , told Reuters in the eastern border town of Goma . 
the rebels have forecast the imminent fall of Kisangani , the capital of the northeast and the main rebel target , for days . 
their reports of clashes this week have suggested growing resistance from Zaire &apos;s mercenary-backed army , making what is widely seen as its last stand in eastern Zaire in Kisangani . 
with fighting once again stirring international concern for refugees trapped for months in the jungle , the United States on Tuesday rejected renewed pressure from France for U.N. intervention but said it was still pursuing a Zaire ceasefire . 
&quot; We are not prepared right now to sign on to a multinational force , &quot; said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns . 
he said U.S. officials would continue to discuss the multinational force idea , put forward by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and backed by France . 
&quot; We think that actually what &apos;s being done is the best way to help the refugees and to stop the fighting -- to pursue the ceasefire and to continue to encourage the United Nations to deliver this humanitarian assistance , &quot; he said . 
witnesses said at a rally in the eastern town of Kindu on Tuesday rebel leader Laurent Kabila received a resounding &quot; No &quot; from a crowd of thousands of people asked if they wanted a ceasefire . 
Kinshasa says it will accept a five-point U.N. plan which includes a ceasefire , but rebels say a ceasefire can come only after negotiations which are themselves subject to rebel terms . 
there were signs that the five-month-old conflict could take on wider dimensions . 
U.N. sources and diplomats said Angolan government troops and former UNITA rebels had moved into Zaire in recent weeks with some involved in fighting in the east . 
a U.N. official said UNITA troops had been flown out of bases in UNITA-held territory to help the government of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko in its fight against the rebels . 
&quot; We think at least 2,000 UNITA troops have been sent to Zaire . 
most of these are fighting troops , &quot; the source said . 
he said UNITA got involved to keep open vital supply routes out of Zaire to its bases in the north and east of Angola . 
the role of Angolan government soldiers was not as clear but sources said technical advisers had been sent to assist the Zairean rebels amid hopes of cutting off the UNITA supplies . 
Zaire accuses neighbouring Rwanda , Uganda and Burundi of helping the rebels , a charge they deny . 
&quot; There are no foreign soldiers or advisers of any kind helping us , &quot; said Ngenda . 
Zaire &apos;s defence ministry said the army , which has sown land mines round Kisangani , was set for war there but rejected suggestions by the rebels they were within 10 km ( six miles ) of the city . 
&quot; They are around 40 km ( 25 miles ) from Kisangani . 
we are still on a war footing , &quot; a ministry spokesman told Reuters .
