White sugar futures pushed through initial sell-stops above the $ 304 resistacne on the March contract by the close on Tuesday , traders said . 
but volume was fairly light and included commission house crosses with March trading 1,034 lots and May the second highest total with 120 lots . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing really outrageous and the volume is quite light , &quot; said one trader . 
the March closed at $ 305.40 a gain of $ 4.00 on the day , while May was up $ 3.30 at $ 304.20 and other traded positions were also firmer . 
technically , March has passed its 40-day moving average at $ 304.00 , which acted as a nearby resistance when it stood at $ 304.50 in Friday &apos;s session . 
physical brokers said the results of Iraq &apos;s tender to buy sugar under the U.N. oil-for-food deal would be slow to emerge as the financing arrangements would demand scrutiny from various parties and the tender restrictions were numerous . 
Paris futures also gained ground although only the two nearbys were traded . 
March was up $ 2.90 at $ 305.00 and May up $ 2.00 at $ 304.00 .
