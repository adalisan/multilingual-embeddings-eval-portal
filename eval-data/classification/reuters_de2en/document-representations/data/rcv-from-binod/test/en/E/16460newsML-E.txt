Japan signed three loan agreements with Peru on Tuesday worth 62.081 billion yen ( $ 615 million ) that can be used over the next six to eight years and paid off over 25 years , officials of the Japanese delegation in Peru said . 
the payments on the unconditional loans have interest rates of between 2.5 percent and 2.7 percent , the delegation said in a statement . 
the agreements were signed earlier on Tuesday by President Alberto Fujimori and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto , who is visiting Peru as part of a 10-day tour of Latin America . 
the first loan of 33 billion yen ( $ 330 million ) will help build a 126 mewgawatt hydroelectric plant in the country &apos;s central department of Junin on the river Paucartambo . 
the second loan of 16.421 billion yen is destined for the improvement of 383 miles ( 613 km ) of roads in the south of Peru . 
the third loan of 12.660 billion yen should be used to improve the drainage system in the south of the capital , Lima . 
payments on this last loan have an interest rate of 2.5 percent -- lower than the 2.7 percent rates of the other two loans -- because the money in this part of the credit is directed towards improving the environment , the statement said . 
the loan for the hydroelctricity plant could be used over eight years , while the money from the other loans should be spent within six years , the statement added .
