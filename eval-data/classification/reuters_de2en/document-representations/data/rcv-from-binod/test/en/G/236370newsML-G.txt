Western powers warned Bosnia &apos;s leaders on Thursday that further reconstruction aid depended on a stronger commitment to last year &apos;s agreement ending 43 months of war . 
winding up a major conference on implementing peace in Bosnia a year after the Dayton peace accord , British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind also pledged tougher measures against indicted war criminals still at large . 
but the commitment brought little enthusiasm from Bosnian leaders at the talks . 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic made clear his disappointment that no firm proposals had been announced to arrest war criminals on the loose in Bosnia . 
&quot; Apart from the fact that all speakers pointed to the need for arresting war criminals , nothing concretely has been agreed , &quot; Izetbegovic said . 
the Serb member of the three-member Bosnian presidency , Biljana Plavsic , said it was more important to bring refugees home and resolve the problem of the disputed northern Bosnian city of Brcko . 
Rifkind said the international community had made clear its disapproval of the policies of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic , whom the opposition in Belgrade has accused of ballot-rigging in last month &apos;s local elections . 
the London conference has been overshadowed by mass street demonstrations in Belgrade by opposition supporters and students who have protested at the closing down of the independent B-92 radio station and demanded that Milosevic resign . 
Rifkind said he had spoken to Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic at the conference and &quot; he will take back to Belgrade a clear message about the views of the international community &quot; . 
international mediator Carl Bildt said Milutinovic had &quot; virtually assured me &quot; that radio B-92 would be allowed back on the air as soon as &quot; some problems &quot; had been resolved . 
the Serbian opposition on Thursday scented victory in its campaign against Milosevic when the Belgrade election commission asked the supreme court to review disputed poll results . 
frustration over repeated delays in implementing the civilian aspects of the Dayton accord has led Western leaders to link aid to a renewed commitment to genuine peace on the ground . 
&quot; Bosnia-Herzegovina &apos;s leaders can be in no doubt that the international community &apos;s willingness to devote further human and financial resources to their country is dependent upon a strengthened commitment from them to implementation of the peace agreement in all areas , &quot; Rifkind told a news conference . 
he stressed that Western support was &quot; not going to go on indefinitely . 
Rifkind said that as part of an action plan for Bosnia in 1997 , the West would strengthen the resources and powers of the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) in Bosnia . 
but Bildt , asked if the international police would now have powers to arrest the 70 indicted war criminals still at large in Bosnia , said : &quot; No , that &apos;s not within their mandate . 
Rifkind said measures to deal with war crimes included strengthening the Hague war crimes tribunal by &quot; enhancing information-sharing and -gathering so the tribunal has its own ability to identify the location and circumstances of alleged war criminals &quot; .
