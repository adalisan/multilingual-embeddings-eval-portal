Hong Kong stocks ended Tuesday &apos;s half-day trading session modestly lower due to some cautious profit-taking , after clawing back most of the market &apos;s sharp early losses , brokers said . 
&quot; The market was down today because of the small headline fall in the Dow , &quot; said Chris Geiger , associate director at Vickers Ballas . 
the Hang Seng Index closed this year &apos;s final trading session 29.30 points lower at 13,451.45 , after recovering from a 116-point drop at the open . 
the exchange will not hold a session on Tuesday afternoon and will remain closed on Wednesday for the New Year holiday . 
normal trading will resume on Thursday , January 2 . 
the Dow Jones Industrial average dipped 11.54 points to 6,549.37 , pushed down by program selling late in the session . 
Geiger added many people have profits that they feel like taking out at this time . 
while brokers noted the market has become more speculative , it appeared less vulnerable to sensitive political issues . 
&quot; The market is losing the Deng effect , &quot; said one broker with a large regional house . 
a local Chinese-language newspaper report on Tuesday saying China &apos;s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was taken to hospital last week was talked about in the market did not appear to have any impact on trading , the broker said . 
China-related red chips and H-shares led trade . 
the H-share sector outperformed the rest of the market , with the sector index advancing 2.41 percent to 980.55 . 
laggards , chiefly utilities , led the blue chip sector . 
finance and property counters tended weaker .
