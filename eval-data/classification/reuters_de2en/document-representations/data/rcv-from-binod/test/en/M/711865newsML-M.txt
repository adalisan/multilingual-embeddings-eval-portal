Asian dollar deposit rates were little changed in moderate trade on Monday with most traders sidelined due mainly to the absence of fresh incentives , dealers said . 
&quot; The market was quiet and featureless in the morning on lack of fresh factors . 
there &apos;s no ( U.S. ) economic indicators coming out tonight and most people were reluctant to open or hold new positions , &quot; a local dealer said . 
&quot; But some people are waiting for Tuesday &apos;s issue of the ( U.S. May ) consumer credit index and Friday &apos;s release of the ( U.S. June ) producer price index data , &quot; he said . 
in day-to-day rates , Monday / Tuesday , Tuesday / Wednesday and week-fixed were unchanged from last Friday &apos;s common 5-5 / 8 5-1 / 2 percent , respectively . 
among longer dates , one-month was unchanged at 5-11 / 16 5-9 / 16 percent , three-months unchanged at 5-3 / 4 5-5 / 8 , nine-months unchanged at 5-15 / 16 5-13 / 16 and twelve-months unchanged at 6-1 / 16 5-15 / 16 percent .
