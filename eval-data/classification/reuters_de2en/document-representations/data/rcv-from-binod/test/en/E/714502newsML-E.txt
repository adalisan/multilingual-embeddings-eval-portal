the long-awaited economic upturn in Italy has still not appeared , the head of the industrialists &apos; organisation , Confindustria said on Tuesday . 
&quot; We &apos;re now more than half way through the year and we &apos;re still waiting for clear signs of an economic recovery , &quot; Giorgio Fossa told a convention . 
&quot; We &apos;re not yet experiencing an ( economic ) pick-up . 
there has not been a turn around . 
we &apos;re still far from a true and proper recovery , &quot; he said , adding that Italy needed lower fiscal pressure and increase labour flexibility to boost the economy . 
Italy &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) fell by 0.4 percent , year-on-year , in the first quarter of 1997 . 
&quot; The reason for the mediocre performance of the Italian economy is this : we have only straightened out ( public ) finances with larger taxes , bringing forward tax payments and delaying spending , &quot; Fossa said . 
he said this had allowed Italy to bring its deficit to close to three percent of GDP . 
&quot; But it has badly stalled the motor of the real economy , &quot; he added . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Monday he wanted to cut tax rates , but added that government accounts did not allow this at the moment .
