Alberto Tomba and Deborah Compagnoni , like many Alpine skiers and most Italians , believe there is no place like home . 
the two world and Olympic champions will be hoping to prove the point when the two-week long Alpine skiing world championships start on Italian snow on Monday . 
their names alone will pull the spectators to Sestriere , where Italy hopes home advantage will help them repeat the feat of 1996 when they won more golds than anyone . 
but they will not be the only ones appreciating familiar surroundings . 
after excursions to the Far East and southern Spain , the Alpine championships are returning to the Alps -- to the enormous relief of many competitors . 
Morioka in Japan in 1993 was ravaged by wind and bad weather while the Sierra Nevada event had to be moved from 1995 to 1996 due to a lack of snow . 
the exotic experiments over , the sport is once again embracing its heartland in the last big Alpine skiing event in Europe in the 20th century . 
in short , Alpine skiing is coming home -- albeit in a modernistic resort founded in the 1930s by the Agnelli family on a lonely plateau 2,000 metres up in the mountains . 
if Sestriere , without the wooden chalets or historic centre snuggled around a tall-spired church , lacks the traditional charm it has plenty of what is needed most : snow . 
it also has technology , with sparkling pistes bathed by floodlights ready for late night slaloms . 
athletes from a record 58 nations will compete for 10 gold medals . 
in an ideal world for the host nation -- and one many Italians believe to be entirely possible -- the home skiers will improve on the four golds won in 1996 . 
however the Austrians , whose skiers captured just one gold in Sierra Nevada , and the Swiss -- who won nothing -- are expected to prove far stiffer opponents this time . 
the Austrian men have been impressive in all events this season , with Thomas Sykora winning five of the seven slaloms staged on the World Cup circuit so far . 
Sweden &apos;s Pernilla Wiberg , winner of two golds in Sierra Nevada , leads the women &apos;s overall World Cup while the Norwegian men , so powerful in Morioka , remain a threat . 
the Swiss are strong in men &apos;s giant slalom while women &apos;s downhiller Heidi Zurbriggen is on top form . 
Germany &apos;s Olympic downhill champion Katja Seizinger is another danger . 
the Italians look strong in women &apos;s events after taking eight races this season and six since the New Year . 
Compagnoni , the giant slalom champion in Sierra Nevada , has won four and sparked off &quot; Debbymania &quot; in Italy . 
Isolde Kostner , the world super-G champion , is peaking at just the right point with back-to-back downhill and super-G wins in Cortina d &apos;Ampezzo this month . 
there will be a new women &apos;s downhill champion with 1996 winner Picabo Street of the United States injured . 
the Italian men have meanwhile found a new hero in Kristian Ghedina , now Italy &apos;s most successful downhiller ever . 
Ghedina , with France &apos;s Luc Alphand and Austria &apos;s Fritz Strobl , is one of three men to dominate the downhill World Cup and a leading contender for the showpiece event . 
but Tomba , triple Olympic gold medallist and reigning giant and slalom world champion , will be the star attraction at the site of his first World Cup victory in 1987 . 
his form this season has alarmed his fans , whose hopes took a knock when the 30-year-old was injured pre-season . 
&quot; La Bomba &quot; , who considered retiring last year but stayed on precisely because of Sestriere , has since completed less than a handful of races but two were second-place finishes . 
this may or may not be his last major skiing appearance . 
whether he continues or calls it a day will depend largely on how the Bolognese performs in Sestriere . 
the expectations are huge in Italy and , with thousands expected to cram the resort to see their heroes compete for the first time in a major competition at home , the enormous pressure could work for or against them . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be a madhouse , &quot; said Kostner last week . 
the opening ceremony is on Sunday with the men &apos;s super-G starting the race programme on Monday .
