canola prices were expected to strengthen over the next few days following a bullish planting intentions report issued by Statistics Canada on Wednesday , Canadian analysts said . 
StatsCan put Canadian canola area at 11.6 million acres , up 30 percent from last year but below most trade expectations which ranged from around 12.0 to 12.75 million . 
&quot; I still think we are going to see 12.5 million acres when its done but we &apos;re going to need higher prices to do that and I think the market is going to do that , &quot; said analyst Greg Kostal of Continental grain Canada . 
on the Winnipeg commodity Exchange canola closed Tuesday at a premium of C $ 56.60 to flaxseed , basis the new crop November contracts . 
analysts said there were fewer surprises on cereals , although all wheat planting intentions were a little higher than some had anticipated at 28.8 million for all Canada and 28.2 million for western Canada . 
StatsCan projected summer fallow acres would fall by 5.3 percent to 14.1 million . 
barley acreage was slightly higher than expected at 12.7 million acres for all of Canada and 11.9 million for western Canada . 
the UGG survey had put western Canadian barley acreage at 11.83 million . 
&quot; We are well supplied on the feedgrain side of things now and another sizeable barley crop is eventually going to push us lower , &quot; UGG analyst Jubinville said of prices . 
the report was also seen as bearish for oats , with acreage down four percent at 4.9 million but above expectations .
