British newspapers speculated freely on Thursday as to why Kevin Keegan suddenly resigned as Newcastle United &apos;s manager , variously blaming pressure from banks , the millions he spent and the stresses of the job . 
his shock departure from the leading English soccer club left thousands of fans in tears outside Newcastle &apos;s ground and pushed every other story into the background , even making the lead on Britain &apos;s most serious evening television news programmes . 
the tabloid Daily Star , which devoted no less than 14 pages to the story , said Keegan feared he was about to crack up under the pressure . 
he had already tried to leave twice before and finally got his way at the third time of asking . 
&quot; If I didn &apos;t quit the job was going to get me , &quot; the paper quoted him as telling a friend . 
some observers said he had aged 20 years over the last three months . 
assistant team manager Terry McDermott said : &quot; He told me that soccer left him a burnt-out shell of a man . 
the Times said the bank backing Newcastle &apos;s planned flotation on the stock market had insisted that if Keegan really wanted to step down , he should do so immediately so as not to harm the club &apos;s prospects by scaring away prospective investors . 
it said NatWest Markets made the ultimatum to the club -- one of the most powerful in England -- at a secret meeting on Tuesday . 
early on Wednesday , Keegan announced it was time to go after almost five years during which he saved the club from disaster but failed to win any silverware despite shelling out 60 million pounds ( $ 101 million ) on high-profile players . 
the turning point may well have been last season &apos;s disaster when the side let slip a 12-point lead to give arch-rivals Manchester United the premiership title . 
the Times and other newspapers said Keegan &apos;s relations with club chief Sir John Hall -- who put up the money -- had worsened as the team continued to splutter despite the signing of England striker Alan Shearer . 
&quot; He has fallen prey to the savage beast that is modern , money-washed English soccer whose insatiable appetite defies satisfaction , &quot; said the Sun tabloid . 
the rival Daily Mirror said the real turning point was a blazing row Keegan had with his players last month after a 1-0 loss away to lowly Blackburn Rovers when he accused them of not earning their huge wages . 
but despite a string of disappointing results the side is still in fifth place with half the season to go and has reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup , prompting speculation that something else might lie behind his departure . 
&quot; There have been rumours he &apos;s not been entirely happy with things for some time now . 
but I suspect only Kevin and his pillow will know the real reasons for his decision , &quot; said former Southampton teammate and close friend Mick Channon . 
the favourite to succeed Keegan is Kenny Dalglish , who took over his place as a Liverpool player in 1977 . 
Dalglish guided both Liverpool and Blackburn to the English league title .
