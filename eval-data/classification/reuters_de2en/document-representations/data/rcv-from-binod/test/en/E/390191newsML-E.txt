Michael Trebing , an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia , said on Thursday that U.S. manufacturers were more optimistic in the bank &apos;s February survey regarding future employment and adding orders . 
&quot; When we do look at the six-month forecast for employment for these manufacturers , they are a lot more upbeat this month than they have been in the past , &quot; Trebing said in an interview on Reuters Financial Television shortly after the release of the Philadelphia Fed &apos;s index of business activity . 
&quot; For example , 29 percent ( of manufacturers surveyed ) are recording that they expected employment to increase from last month and that rose to about 39 percent this month , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Looking down the road , they appear to be more optimistic about that and adding orders , &quot; he added . 
the Philadelphia Fed &apos;s business activity index rose to a 17.4 reading in February from 11.3 in January and the new orders index also gained to 20.7 from 18.7 .
