U.S. diplomat Robert Pelletreau arrived in Ankara on Thursday for a second round of talks with rival Iraqi Kurdish groups on consolidating a three-week ceasefire between them , state-run Anatolian news agency said . 
on arrival at Ankara airport , Pelletreau said Friday &apos;s talks would focus on restoring services in northern Iraq and providing humanitarian aid to a region blighted by recent heavy fighting between the Kurdish factions . 
delegations from Massoud Barzani &apos;s Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) and Jalal Talabani &apos;s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) agreed on extending a truce between their groups late in October at a first round of peace talks . 
the two factions had fought for two months after Iraqi armoured divisions joined forces with Barzani &apos;s KDP in late August to capture the regional capital Arbil from the PUK , prompting U.S missile strikes against targets in southern Iraq . 
according to mediators , the status of Arbil and the sharing of KDP oil trade revenues on the Turkish border are the key issues which the groups still have to resolve . 
Pelletreau , who is overseeing the talks along with British and Turkish diplomats , brokered the initial ceasefire between the two factions . 
&quot; At the last meeting we discussed many things but agreed on a ceasefire . 
( in northern Iraq ) there has to be a solid truce and a mechanism to monitor it , &quot; the KDP &apos;s representative in Ankara , Safeen Dizayee , told Reuters . 
PUK representative Shazad Saib said his faction was also ready for the talks , but was cagey about his expectations : &quot; Let us wait and see , &quot; he said .
