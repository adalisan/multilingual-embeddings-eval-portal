the Bulgarian Lev edged up to 216-217 per dollar at the close from 217-218 in the morning due to support from the central bank and amid low foreign currency demand on the interbank market , dealers said . 
&quot; The central bank offered dollars between 218-219 levs throughout the day , deterring a possible Lev &apos;s fall , &quot; one dealer said . 
commercial banks also actively offered foreign currency with most of their dollar asks below the central bank &apos;s ones , which further supported the Lev amid the relatively low dollar demand , the dealer said . 
movements in the Lev / dollar exchange rate next week were likely to be almost entirely dependent on the central bank , which helped the Lev to recover to today &apos;s closing levels from 223 on Monday through its active dollar sales .
