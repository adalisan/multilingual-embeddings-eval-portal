the family of an Australian nurse murdered in Saudi Arabia is considering meeting the relatives of two British nurses charged with the crime , the family &apos;s lawyer said on Sunday . 
&quot; They haven &apos;t ruled ( meeting the families ) out , &quot; lawyer Jim Phipps of the International Law firm in Riyadh told Reuters . 
the family of Yvonne Gilford , 55 -- killed in her room at the King Fahd medical complex in eastern Saudi Arabia in December -- have previously said they did not want to meet the relatives of jailed nurses Deborah Parry and Lucille McLauchlan . 
&quot; The Gilfords want it understood that they are willing to hear what the families have to say but not in a context which turns into a circus for the families and causes more pain , &quot; Phipps said , referring to media attention in the case . 
&quot; There might be a right time , place and form to consider meeting with the families ... 
the how and when is up in the air . 
and whether such a meeting is necessary depends on what happens in court , &quot; Phipps said by telephone . 
a Saudi court adjourned a hearing in the case for three weeks until June 15 to give the Gilfords time to consider a settlement which could spare the lives of the accused . 
Parry , 38 , and McLauchlan , 31 , deny involvement in the murder and revoked previous confessions which they said were made under duress . 
medical reports said Gilford had been stabbed 13 times , bludgeoned and suffocated . 
if found guilty , the two could face the death penalty . 
Islamic sharia law enforced in the conservative kingdom allows the victim &apos;s family to decide for or against execution , which in Saudi Arabia is usually carried out by public beheading . 
the victim &apos;s brother Frank Gilford has said he favours the death penalty and has said he did not want to read a letter from Parry and McLauchlan urging him to reconsider his decision . 
Phipps said the widespread publicity of the case and barrage of calls to Gilford &apos;s family -- some 600 a week , mainly from Australian and British media -- made them reluctant to have a meeting withe the nurses &apos; relatives soon . 
&quot; The time isn &apos;t yet , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The Gilfords wouldn &apos;t consider having such a meeting under the current circumstances of such close coverage by the press .
