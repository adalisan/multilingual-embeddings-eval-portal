Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu charged on Wednesday that Palestinian riots over the opening of an archeologicial tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem were whipped up by Arab disinformation and he appealed for calm . 
&quot; I advise Palestinian and Arab leaders to calm passions , &quot; Netanyahu said during a visit to France that coincided with the most serious violence since his hardline government took office 100 days ago . 
&quot; They know the facts , they know that there is no truth in the rumours that they are spreading in order to arouse passions between Israel and Islam , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; This is a very dangerous game and I do not advise anyone to play it . 
Israeli troops shot dead four Palestinians and wounded at least 300 stone-throwing protesters near the West Bank town of Ramallah , and briefly exchanged fire with Palestinian police . 
Netanyahu said after talks with French President Jacques Chirac that the violence would probably delay a meeting with Yasser Arafat &apos;s Palestinian Authority from Thursday until Sunday but both sides had a vested interest in continuing the talks . 
the French Foreign Ministry said the opening of the disputed Jerusalem tunnel &quot; adds a new and regrettable factor of tension &quot; and Chirac &apos;s spokeswoman said the president urged Netanyahu &quot; to start de-escalation rapidly and avoid provocations &quot; . 
Prime Minister Alain Juppe said after meeting Netanyahu that &quot; there is no future in confrontation and violence , from whatever side , so discussions must resume &quot; . 
Juppe reiterated France &apos;s willingness to help get the peace talks back on track . 
Netanyahu complained of &quot; wild and unfounded accusations &quot; , saying the tunnel did not go under Moslem holy sites on Temple Mount , known to Arabs as the Haram al-Sharif ( noble sanctuary ) , but ran beside the Western Wall sacred to Jews . 
it was intended for tourists of all faiths and would draw more visitors to Palestinians shops in the Old City , he said . 
the Israeli leader telephoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from Juppe &apos;s office to appeal to him to help calm tensions . 
&quot; I asked him to use his influence in the Arab world and with the Palestinians to urge them to return to the table , to cease violence and to negotiate , &quot; he said . 
he said he would also speak to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat if necessary . 
&quot; The attempt to portray this as an attack on Arab holy places is totally unfounded , totally incommensurate with the facts and totally incommensurate with our policy of respect for the Islamic holy places , &quot; Netanyahu said . 
&quot; I think there is a combination here of misinformation and deliberate disinformation -- an attempt to whip up passion without any ground of fact . 
a senior Israeli official travelling with Netanyahu charged that Arafat was behind the violence and that Palestinian police had been ordered not to intervene to restrain the protesters . 
Netanyahu said France could act as &quot; an important bridge of understanding &quot; in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations and he had assured Chirac he was committed to moving forward with the Middle East peace process . 
he praised Chirac &apos;s &quot; uncommon grasp &quot; of Middle East issues and said France &apos;s close Arab ties were an asset , not a liability in Arab-Israeli peacemaking . 
Chirac &apos;s spokeswoman , Catherine Colonna , said the two leaders had an &quot; extremely friendly &quot; 90-minute private session and lunch . 
the French leader had encouraged Netanyahu to pursue the peace process launched by his Labour predecessors . 
unlike former Labour premiers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres , Netanyahu opposes trading occupied Arab land for peace .
