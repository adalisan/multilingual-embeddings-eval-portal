the death rate for U.S. AIDS sufferers continued to decline through the first nine months of 1996 compared with the first nine months of 1995 , the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) said on Monday . 
AIDS deaths fell by 19 percent in the period , continuing a trend started in the first six months of 1996 , when 13 percent fewer people with AIDS died than in the first six months of 1995 . 
&quot; We really are entering a new era , &quot; Helene Gayle , director of the CDC &apos;s national center that deals with Acquired immune deficiency Syndrome , told a news conference . 
but Gayle and other experts at the annual State of AIDS Forum in Washington said daunting challenges remained , especially as women and minorities were not benefitting from new treatments extending the lives of AIDS sufferers . 
in the first nine months of last year , 30,700 people in the United States died from AIDS , down 19 percent from the 37,900 who died in the first nine months of 1995 , the CDC said . 
the death rate for men fell 22 percent compared to only seven percent for women , while the death rate for whites fell 28 percent compared to only 10 percent for blacks and 16 percent for Hispanics , the CDC said .
