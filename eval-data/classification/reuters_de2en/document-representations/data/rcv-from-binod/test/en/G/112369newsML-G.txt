Manchester United proved their championship qualities on Saturday by playing far below their best and still producing a 1-0 win against league leaders Liverpool . 
outplayed by a Liverpool side whose passing was sharper , whose teamwork was more co-ordinated and who had at least six times as many attempts at goal , the reigning English champions scored from their only real chance . 
after David Beckham &apos;s 23rd-minute goal they battled for their lives . 
United manager Alex Ferguson said he gambled on playing with his defenders further forward to minimise Liverpool &apos;s attacking options . 
&quot; We changed a few things tactically but did not have the courage of our convictions in the second half and got punished for it . 
&quot; David May and Ronny Johnsen kept us in the game . 
it was worth the gamble to push the defenders up and make Liverpool play the ball much quicker to put them off their usual game . 
it worked in the first half , but I was disappointed with the way we played in the second . 
Ferguson , who admitted afterwards that Wednesday &apos;s European Cup Champions &apos; League match against Fenerbahce in Turkey was more important to him than the league match , was forced to reshuffle his team just before kickoff . 
Gary Pallister reported in with a back strain and Ryan Giggs , who signed a new five-year-deal with United on Saturday , had a calf strain that reduced him to a late appearance as substitute . 
before the match Liverpool , who play Sion in the UEFA Cup on Thursday , and United were the only unbeaten teams in the league this season . 
from almost the first whistle to the last the visitors took the game to United . 
Liverpool manager Roy Evans said afterwards : &quot; We will play a lot worse than that this season and win games . 
if we &apos;d have stuck one in , we might have won it 3-1 or 4-1 , but if you don &apos;t get the ball in the back of the net you are not going to win . 
&quot; You don &apos;t expect to come to Old Trafford and have it all your own way for an hour , but that &apos;s what happened today . 
Liverpool created a succession of scoring chances with clear headed opportunities from Stan Collymore , John Barnes and Michael Thomas , but were ultimatrely denied by a rock solid United defence , marshalled by goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel , voted man-of-the-match , and policed by Norwegian Ronny Johnson and David May . 
the defence helped thwart every Liverpool attack throughout a pulsating Lancashire derby watched by a capacity 55,000 crowd . 
John Barnes , 33 next month , might have lost his pace but he was still the main springboard for Liverpool &apos;s raids on goal , ably supported by his more mobile fetchers and carriers , Steve McMananam and Michael Thomas . 
McManaman , displaying all his silky skills covered almost every blade of grass , but wasted every good scoring opportunity that came his way . 
midway through the first half he shot wide from eight yards with only Schmeichel to beat . 
Schmeichel was lucky to stay on after clattering into United &apos;s Norwegian Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after 11 minutes , but referee David Elleray , showing far more leniency than usual , ruled the tackle fair . 
in a highly-charged atmoshphere he booked only three players : may of United , and Liverpool &apos;s Phil Babb and Thomas , who scythed down Giggs three minutes from time . 
the only goal was &quot; made out of nothing &quot; according to Ferguson . 
Solskjaer found Beckham on the edge of the box . 
Beckham , unmarked , rifled his shot past Liverpool &apos; keeper David James in off the post to stretch United &apos;s unbeaten home league record to 36 games and leave Liverpool thinking about what might have been .
