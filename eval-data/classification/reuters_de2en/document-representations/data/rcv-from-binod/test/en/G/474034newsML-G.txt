Swiss Tony Rominger will test a new bicycle in Bordeaux next week before an attempt on the world one-hour record held by Briton Chris Boardman . 
Rominger will go to Bordeaux , where he set a record of 55.291 kms in November 1994 , with his doctor Michele Ferrari and a mechanic . 
Boardman set the current world mark of 56.3759 kms in Manchester last September . 
&quot; We want to compare my 1994 bike with a new one which will be designed especially for the attempt . 
we will try different combinations of tyres and positions to see which one is the fastest , &quot; Rominger said in a statement . 
he added he would also go to Manchester for further tests . 
he has not yet set a date or place for the attempt .
