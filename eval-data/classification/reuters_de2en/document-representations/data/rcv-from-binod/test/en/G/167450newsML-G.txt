Iran &apos;s navy has the potential to become an increasingly effective force in the oil-rich Gulf , a British navy commander said in Dubai on Tuesday . 
&quot; I have no doubt they are getting better at using the equipment they have got ... They have got some systems that could be very effective , &quot; Rear Admiral Alan West , commander of the UK Task Group told reporters aboard aircraft carrier Invincible . 
the Islamic Republic &apos;s submarine and surface-to-surface missile capabilities were highlighted by West as being concerns . 
&quot; Obviously one has to keep an eye on countries where you are not sure exactly how they are going to utilise their forces to see how capable and competent they become , &quot; West added . 
Tehran in September said it would receive a third Russian-made Kilo-class submarine in six months , building on its position as the only Gulf state to have submarines . 
Iran regularly carries out naval exercises in the important oil waterway . 
&quot; She ( Iran ) has got some new conventional submarines which obviously one would watch with some interest . 
she has got surface-to-surface missiles and she has other defence equipment , &quot; West said . 
a senior U.S. naval officer said in March that Iran had boosted its naval firepower by fitting Chinese-built anti-ship cruise missiles on some of its warships . 
Iran has repeatedly said that its weapons are only for defence purposes and says Washington falsely accuses it of threatening regional security in order to scare its Gulf Arab allies into buying more U.S. weapons . 
the Invincible arrived in Dubai , one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates , on Tuesday as part of a seven ship-strong British naval task force to practice carrier-style operations in the Gulf over the next three weeks . 
joint exercises will be carried out with U.S. naval forces in the region and possible cooperation with Gulf states is also being sought , West said . 
the carrier hosts seven Sea King anti-submarine warfare helicopters in addition to Sea Harrier aircraft and three Sea King early warning helicopters .
