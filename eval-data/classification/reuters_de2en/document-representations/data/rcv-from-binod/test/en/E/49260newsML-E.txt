the Reserve Bank on Friday said it assumed a potential growth rate for the economy of 2.75 percent a year . 
in its projections released on Thursday the Treasury put sustainable growth at 3.5 percent , but Reserve Bank Governor Don brash said &quot; no one was dogmatic about the potential growth rate &quot; and there was a wide range of estimates . 
the RBNZ said it expected growth in trend labour productivity would strengthen . 
&quot; However .. even abstracting from cyclical factors , recent labour productivity outturns have not shown this strength .
