the Czech PX50 index closed virtually unchanged at 558.5 on Tuesday despite the publication of worse than expected 1996 financial results for the bourse &apos;s most heavily capitalised share , SPT Telecom . 
shares in the company fell 25 crowns to 3,425 after SPT reported a consolidated 1996 net loss , according to international accounting standards , of 483 million crowns compared with a 4.8 billion crown profit in 1995 . 
chief Financial Officer Urs Kamber told journalists that the firm posted the loss due to one-time extraordinary charges of 8.757 billion crowns . 
but dealers &apos; and analysts &apos; opinions on the results were decidedly mixed . 
&quot; The depreciation was a little higher than expected but the cash flow figures are coming through as expected and it is basically these one-off adjustments that have made the bottom line sag , &quot; said Anna Bossong of ING Barings in London . 
however , Radek Vavra of Citicorp Securites was much less optimistic : &quot; We really hadn &apos;t expected such a disaster and frankly it is a disaster , &quot; he said . 
Vavra said that much would depend on how foreign investors reacted on Wednesday as many dealers had been standing back for much of the day while their analysts digested the results . 
&quot; The foreigners are not selling out . 
so we don &apos;t think there will be tremendous selling today but tomorrow ( there could be ) if this is widely reported through the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times , &quot; said Radek Vavra of Citicorp Securities . 
other major issues were mixed . 
Komercni Banka dropped 27 crowns to 2,443 , CEZ rose 10 crowns to 1,065 and Ceska Sporitelna was unchanged on 307 .
