Benny The dip finally set the record straight for the Gosden family on Saturday with a spine-tingling victory in the Epsom Derby . 
&quot; I &apos;d only say to my old man somewhere up there that we finally got it right , &quot; John Gosden said after fulfilling a lifelong ambition with his emotion-charged victory . 
for his father , trainer Towser Gosden , was forced by ill health to give up training just a year before his Charlottown won the 1966 Derby . 
&quot; It was very difficult for father as his health failed him . 
it &apos;s a funny old story . 
&apos; He packed it in and left , &quot; Gosden recalled . 
&quot; He worked closely with Gordon Smyth who trained Charlottown and he stood in the winner &apos;s circle and I can see him now . 
it was probably a very fulfilling moment with a very devout feeling for him , &quot; Gosden said . 
Towser Gosden , who had trained the Colt with such skill as a two-year-old , died shortly after Charlottown &apos;s big race victory . 
so there was no doubting the emotion in John Gosden &apos;s voice when he said after Benny The dip &apos;s last-gasp triumph : &quot; This one is for him .
