crude prices in Asia were firmer on Friday following a firm overnight futures markets , although traders were wary of a decline in NYMEX values on access . 
physical markets were quiet as players waited for the market to move back into full swing next week . 
a 650,000-barrel cargo of February Tapis was traded into China at an average value of $ 1.60 premium by a major . 
the firm price was a further sign of China &apos;s appetite for crude as it staves off a diesel shortage and replenishes stocks . 
China had curtailed purchases of crude as it waited for Iraq to return to the market in the hope of lower prices . 
but as prices failed to come off to any degree , China has been forced to pay up for its crude . 
but traders noted the Tapis cargo was for a foreign joint-venture which would probably operate differently to most refineries in China anyhow . 
a Tapis producer said refineries and some traders had shown interest in February barrels against a backdrop of a few days lost production from Griffin and Cossack owing to storms . 
Cossack operator Woodside said it hoped to reconnect the floating production platform over the weekend but there was no word from Griffin . 
the sentiment kept paper Tapis firm with January quoted at $ 25.25 / $ 25.40 , up 35 cents from Tuesday -- and despite a weak tone on Brent and access . 
February Brent / Dubai came in five to 10 cents to $ 1.85 / $ 1.95 but Dubai was stable , factoring in an expected weaker tone to Brent futures . 
in overnight news , Saudi Arabia rolled its January official selling prices into February for Saudi light , medium and heavy , but raised Berri Extra Light 15 cents to Oman / Dubai plus $ 2.15 .
