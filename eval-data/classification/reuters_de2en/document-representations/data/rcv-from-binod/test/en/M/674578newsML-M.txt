ailing Singapore shares staged a minor recovery on Thursday , but the immediate prognosis remained poor , dealers said . 
&quot; This hasn &apos;t revived the market , &quot; said one dealer of the 17.83 point rise which saw the Straits Times Industrials Index close at 2,002.97 . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the sentiment is there to keep the index above 2,000 , &quot; another dealer said . 
volume was low with a thin 110 million shares traded in a day which saw losers well ahead of gainers 218 to 125 , with Van Der Horst faring worst of all . 
the stock plunged 16 percent , losing 50 cents to Singapore $ 2.58 on market talk of contract delays and forecasts of poor interim results expected in the next few days . 
investors were also seen cautious ahead of the expected announcement on Friday of Singapore &apos;s non-oil domestic export and consumer price index ( CPI ) figures for May . 
a Reuter poll of economists on Thursday saw May non-oil exports up 3.5 percent year-on-year , which would be a second consecutive monthly rise after five months of falls . 
dealers said the poll had been an encouraging sign .
