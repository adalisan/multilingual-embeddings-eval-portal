Thai rubber prices were steady to higher this week , lifted by moderate buying from Japan and inquiries from China , trade sources said . 
otherwise there was not much going on in the market after the government shifted price intervention policy from buying physical rubber directly in the fob market to supporting the commodity by buying the forward contract . 
&quot; Japan bought but in moderate amounts . 
China made lots of inquiries though , &quot; said a Bangkok-based trader . 
the market will watch closely next week when Thai authorities are scheduled to go to China to finalise details on rubber deal , traders said . 
China signed a memorandum of understanding with Thailand in April to buy 382,000 tonnes of rubber for 1997 .
