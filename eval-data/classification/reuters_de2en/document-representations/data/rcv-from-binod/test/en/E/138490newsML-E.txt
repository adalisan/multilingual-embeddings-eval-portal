Japan &apos;s central bank will likely maintain its ultra-easy credit stance until at least mid-1997 , as it will need to assess a consumption tax increase due in April before any policy change , economists said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) is likely to keep the discount rate steady at least until mid-1997 , having imposed on itself stricter conditions for a monetary tightening , &quot; said Yasunari Ueno , chief market economist at Fuji Securities . 
the bank has kept its official discount rate ( ODR ) -- which it charges on some loans to commercial banks -- at a record-low 0.5 percent since September 1995 . 
Ueno said it appeared the bank had wanted to make a small upward correction in the ODR earlier this year , but abandoned the idea in the face of opposition from bureaucrats and politicians . 
in consequence , it had set a hurdle of &quot; self-sustainable economic recovery &quot; as a prerequisite for a credit tightening , and Japanese government bond ( JGBs ) prices have risen in accordance with this policy signal . 
&quot; This , along with the planned hike in the consumption tax in April next year , is making it almost impossible for the BOJ to lean toward a tightening anytime soon , &quot; Ueno said . 
the consumption tax is scheduled to be raised from the current three percent to five percent on April 1 . 
Soichi Okuda , a senior economist at the Nippon Credit Bank , agreed the BOJ was unlikely to raise the discount rate until mid-1997 , as it needed to assess the effects of the consumption tax increase on the economy . 
&quot; The perception at the start of this year was that the economy would remain firm only until the April-June quarter . 
the BOJ did have a chance to tighten in the first half of 1996 , but it let the chance slip by , &quot; he said . 
Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita said on Wednesday that the recovery in Japan &apos;s economy was unlikely to accelerate soon , given the cautiousness of small and medium-sized companies about their production and employment prospects . 
the BOJ &apos;s key quarterly corporate survey in November , known as the &quot; tankan &quot; , was unlikely to alter the central bank &apos;s assessment of economic conditions , Okuda said . 
&quot; Neither the upcoming November tankan nor the February 1997 tankan will justify a tightening . 
the BOJ will probably need to wait until as far ahead as the August 1997 tankan in order to assess the impact of the consumption tax hike , &quot; said Okuda . 
with the BOJ &apos;s policy expected to remain on hold , the yield of the 10-year JGBs was likely to slide further , experts said . 
the yield on the key 182nd 10-year cash bond ended at 2.690 percent on Wednesday , compared with 2.695 the previous day . 
based on economic fundamentals , 2.7-3.0 percent may be more appropriate for the 10-year JGB yield , but the demand-driven market could push it down to around 2.5 percent , Okuda said . 
Fuji Securities &apos; Ueno also said the 10-year bond yield may fall towards 2.550 percent in the near term , while the key 10-year JGB futures contract could test 125 . 
as both cash and futures JGBs had risen so much , it was difficult to determine where the targets lay , said Tadao Sakashima , bond department manager at Daiwa Securities Co Ltd . 
&quot; All JGBs are now over par , so one cannot say where the target is . 
there are various suggestions , including a target for the 182nd benchmark JGB yield at 2.6 percent , but none of these are really convincing , &quot; he added .
