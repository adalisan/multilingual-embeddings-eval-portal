blue-chip stocks gave up strong early gains Tuesday after a rapid succession of programme trades sent the market sharply higher then drove it lower . 
at 1 p.m. est , the Dow Jones industrial average was off 20.50 points at 6,527.29 after reversing an early gain of 40 points and trading briefly with a loss of slightly more than 50 points , which temporarily activated the New York Stock Exchange &apos;s limit on programme trading . 
most of the action stemmed from programme trading . 
in the broader market , declining issues led advances 13-10 on active volume of more than 339 million shares . 
the Nasdaq composite index was off 6.10 at 1,274.27 and the Anerican Stock Exchange index lost 1.36 to 588.02 . 
analysts downplayed the significance of the activity , noting that programme trades are generally a product of temporary anomalies between stock and futures prices . 
&quot; People try to ascribe fundamental reasons for each swing , &quot; said Larry Wachtel , an analyst at prudential Securities . 
&quot; When you have the kind of market move we &apos;ve had in the last few months , you get volatility and with volatility come programmes . 
blue-chip stocks have been soaring into record ground lately on the prospect that a slowing economy will encourage a continued downdrift in long-term interest rates .

bond prices and yields move in opposite direction . 
among components of the 30-stock Dow index , there were several individual issues where fundamental developments offset the programme-driven tumult of the morning session .
