the long end of the German debt yield curve found some comfort from a relief rally in U.S. treasuries overnight , but made rather subdued , if slightly firmer , start to Friday &apos;s session . 
traders said that with little in the way of economic data due this session and many Europen countries on holiday , Bunds were unlikely to venture far from Thursday &apos;s closing levels . 
at the short end , however , investors were digesting comments from Bundesbank vice president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum who warned that the central bank wanted to ensure it had leway on its main money market rate , the repo . 
&quot; This step up in the rhetoric of rate tightening from the August Bundesbank report will hit the short end , &quot; analysts at mms International said in a morning note . 
Gaddum told the daily Handelsblatt newspaper that the Bundesbank was concerned about signs of consumer price inflation and that it wanted to leave itself the option of acting on the repo . 
&quot; As regards our decisions we have to operate in a more uncertain environment and therefore want to retain full leeway in our Tuesday allocations , &quot; he said . 
by 0705 GMT , the 10-year benchmark Bund had shed its earlier gains and was trading unchanged on the day at 102.52 . 
the DTB September Bund future had also lost its earlier shine , falling to 102.33 , down six basis points , after reaching as high as 102.48 just after the open . 
after a flurry of U.S. economic data in the previous session , Friday &apos;s calendar looked relatively empty , with only the Michigan consumer sentiment survey due for at 1400 GMT . 
analysts polled by Reuters expect the index to give a reading of 107.2 in July up slightly from 107.1 in June .
