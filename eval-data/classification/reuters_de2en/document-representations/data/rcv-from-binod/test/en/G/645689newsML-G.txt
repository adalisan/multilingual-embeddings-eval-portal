men in Russia are less likely to reach the age of 60 than they were 100 years ago , Interfax news agency quoted official statistics as saying on Sunday . 
the figures released by the State Statistical Committee show that only 54 percent of Russian men older than 16 are likely to survive beyond their 60th birthday compared with 56 percent at the end of the 19th century . 
Interfax said accidents and poisoning by poor quality alcoholic drinks were the two leading killers of men aged between 16 and 60 . 
a dramatic fall in living standards which began in the last years of communist rule and uncertainty about the future in the new capitalist world have led to a sharp rise in alcohol consumption . 
the statistics said that , in the first half of 1990s , average annual consumption of alcoholic had more than doubled and reached 13 litres of pure alcohol per head of the population . 
a level of eight litres is considered dangerous for the health of a nation under international standards .
