Rwandan President Pascal Bizimungu arrived in Kinshasa on Tuesday for a summit of key allies who helped Laurent Kabila seize power , officials said . 
Uganda &apos;s President Yoweri Museveni arrived on Monday . 
both leaders have made three previous official visits to Kinshasa since Kabila toppled veteran dicator Mobutu Sese Sese in May and renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
Uganda and Rwanda backed the seven-month armed campaign against Mobutu , spearheaded by ethnic-Tustsis who dominate the Rwandan army . 
separately , Tanzania &apos;s retired founding president Julius Nyerere also arrived in Kinshasa for talks with Kabila , but officials said these were separate from the summit . 
officials in Tanzania said Nyerere &apos;s visit was to promote reconciliation in the new Congo , where the civilian opposition that battled Mobutu &apos;s dictatorship for years is grumbling over being left out of Kabila &apos;s government . 
Nyerere was expected to visit the provincial towns of Lubumbashi and Kisangani , the officials said . 
Kabila &apos;s aides said the summit talks , previously scheduled to end on Tuesday , would now stretch for an extra day .
