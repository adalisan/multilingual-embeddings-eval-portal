the jury in the trial of Zimbabwe-born goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar said on Friday it had been unable to reach a verdict on a charge against him of accepting money to influence the outcome of soccer matches . 
Grobbelaar was cleared on Thursday of one charge of attempting to fix matches in England &apos;s Premier soccer league , but the jury spent several hours on Friday trying to reach a verdict on a second charge that he accepted 2,000 pounds ( $ 3,200 ) to influence the outcome of games . 
the judge in the case immediately ordered that a not guilty verdict should be entered in the remainming charge against the former Liverpool and Southampton goalkeeper . 
Grobbelaar &apos;s fellow defendants , former soccer stars John Fashanu and Hans Segers and Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim were cleared of charges against them on Thursday . 
the trial followed one earlier this year when another jury was also unable to reach verdicts . 
sky television news reported that the defendants will have to pay their own costs .
