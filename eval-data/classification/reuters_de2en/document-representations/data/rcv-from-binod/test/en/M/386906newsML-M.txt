retail investors were heavy sellers of Hewlett-Packard Co puts as the stock rallied sharply following the company &apos;s better than expected quarterly earnings , traders said Wednesday . 
the strong fiscal first quarter profits of $ 0.87 per share , up from $ 0.75 a year ago , beat consensus estimates of $ 0.75 a share and led to rating and estimate upgrades from brokerage firms including Morgan Stanley , Donaldson , Lufkin and Jenrette and Goldman Sachs . 
the stock reached a session high of 56-7 / 8 . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of paper everywhere , &quot; said John Streibich , a market maker at the Chicago Board Options Exchange . 
retail investors &quot; are definitely selling puts in all series and all months , which is pretty much telling us the stock has a pretty good floor under it right now , &quot; he said . 
call buying was steady but not extreme , he said . 
&quot; With the market this high , people are getting a little nervous , &quot; he said . 
&quot; No matter how good earnings are , you just don &apos;t know how much further it has to go . 
the heaviest action was in the March 55 puts , which traded 6,130 contracts . 
other active puts included the February 55 , with volume of about 2,540 , and the May 55 , with volume of around 800 . 
the February 50 put , which had been bought heavily by one investor Tuesday , traded about 760 contracts . 
open interest , boosted by an addition of 10,061 contracts Tuesday , was 18,187 . 
the option was down 1-13 / 16 at 1 / 16 . 
on the call side , the February 55 was most active , with turnover of 3,925 contracts . 
the March 55 call traded nearly 2,400 and the May 55 call traded 1,420 . 
volatility in Hewlett options , which had been rising for at least a week , spiked higher Tuesday , helped by the heavy volume in the February 50 puts . 
Streibich said the volatility readings in the near-term options on Tuesday also could have been a bit deceiving because the options expire at the end of the week . 
he said the volatilities , which had broken through 105 in the near-term options , naturally slid Wednesday as the stock rallied . 
volatilities in the February series were back down to the mid-30 region . 
&quot; A lot of people are closing things out right now , &quot; Streibich said . 
&quot; volatility was just out of this world yesterday , but now a lot of fear is gone out of the stock . 
he said if Hewlett shares can crack through the 56-1 / 2 to 56-3 / 4 area , they could break out and test the May 1996 high of 57-3 / 4 . 
&quot; With good earnings , usually a stock like this will move for several days in a row , &quot; he said .
