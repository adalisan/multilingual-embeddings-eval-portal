an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) team will arrive in Peru during the first week of September to evaluate the administration &apos;s first half macroeconomic results , government sources said . 
the mission , to be led by Nicaraguan economist Luis Duran , will be the first IMF team to visit Peru since the signing in June of a three-year macroeconomic target accord . 
Peru agreed with the IMF to a target of 4.5 percent growth and inflation between 9.5 percent and 11.5 percent in 1996 .
