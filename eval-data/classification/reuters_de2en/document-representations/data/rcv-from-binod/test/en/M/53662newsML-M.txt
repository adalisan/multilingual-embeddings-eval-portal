Belgian linear bonds were firmer in quiet early business with Bunds but traders feared that a higher-than-expected CPI at 1230 GMT would trigger selling pressure . 
the yield spread with German 10-year paper was unchanged at 22 basis points after earlier touching 21 . 
but traders said Belgian OLOs were &quot; very expensive &quot; . 
&quot; Why not invest more in German paper ? 
&quot; said one , noting that the spread for shorter-term OLOs was considerably smaller . 
one trader said the market had so far been ignoring ongoing government talks on the 1997 budget but any bad news would spark a sell-off which could send the 10-year bond yield soaring to 7.00 percent . 
&quot; Everybody &apos;s supposing that ( Prime Minister ) Dehaene will again fix it all , but if problems should arise , or when we get closer to the EMU launch date , OLOs could see some problems . 
but for now , OLOs remained supported , which especially showed when the market weakened . 
&quot; We immediately see some bottom-picking ... it shows there is still a lot of money available , &quot; he said . 
traders said Belgium would start lagging the U.S. if the U.S. rose any further .
