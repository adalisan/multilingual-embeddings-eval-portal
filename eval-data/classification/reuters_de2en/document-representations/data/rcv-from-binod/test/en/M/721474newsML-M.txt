COMEX and NYMEX precious ended mostly higher Friday , on fund shortcovering in both gold and platinum group metals ( PGMs ) , but volumes were only moderate . 
&quot; Silver saw fund selling in Europe overnight , but gold ended near the top of the week &apos;s range , helped by some physical buying around $ 315.00 earlier in the week and some fund shortcovering , &quot; Refco New York analyst Jim Steel said . 
&quot; platinum and palladium may also have already anticipated the Russian return to the market and shortcovering may push prices higher next week also , &quot; he said . 
COMEX August gold ended up $ 1.40 at $ 322.20 an ounce , after climbing above Thursday &apos;s high at $ 322.20 late in the day , and edging up to a session high at $ 323.10 . 
earlier news the U.S. June Producer Price Index ( PPI ) had fallen 0.1 percent , the sixth consecutive monthly drop , had little impact , traders said . 
but the expiry of COMEX August gold options at the close also had little impact , as gold &apos;s slide this week had taken prices well below the active strike prices , analysts said . 
the COMEX August / December spread narrowed further to around $ 3.20 an ounce , from $ 3.50 Thursday and $ 4.40 last Thursday before the Independence Day holiday weekend . 
in the bullion market , spot gold ended quoted $ 321.00 / 60 , compared to the London Friday afternoon fix at $ 319.50 and the New York close Thursday around $ 319.60 / 10 . 
gold fixed at a 12 year low early Wednesday this week at $ 315.75 in London , after news of a further central bank gold sale last week . 
the Reserve Bank of Australia sold 167 tonnes of gold , two-thirds of its reserves , with deliveries occurring in June , August and September this year . 
while further shortcovering may ensue next week , as the gold market works off its technically oversold condition , sentiment remains bearish , analysts said . 
long-term cycle analysts seen gold staying weak into October this year , when the end of a 60 year cycle may present a major buying opportunity for gold equities in particular . 
&quot; There is no question in our minds that gold stocks will be a better buy than either gold or silver once the final lows are in place , &quot; Gann-cycle analyst and &quot; Past , Present , futures &quot; newsletter editor , James Flanagan , said . 
gold and silver equities did relatively better than gold this week , with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange &apos;s index of gold and silver mining stocks ( .XAU ) up 2.46 PCT at 93.99 at the close Friday , up from a three year low at 85.79 Monday . 
meanwhile the gold / gold-stocks-index ratio ( XAU = / .XAU ) slipped to 3.41-to-1 , after the ratio saw a 12 month high of 3.66 : 1 in April . 
COMEX September silver ended down 2.3 cents at $ 4.360 an ounce , after running into some resistance near $ 4.40 an ounce . 
the September / December spread narrowed further to 5.00 cents an ounce . 
but NYMEX October platinum jumped $ 14.00 to end at $ 395.70 , and spot platinum in the physical market closed higher quoted around $ 406.00 , recovering from the week &apos;s low around $ 394.00 an ounce . 
the physical platinum and palladium market remained tight , with one month platinum lease rates offered around 50 percent and one month palladium lease rates around 80 percent Friday . 
Japanese trade houses reported this week that some Russian palladium had arrived in Japan , but platinum was not due to arrive until next week . 
Newswire reports also suggested the Russians had decided not offer platinum in the spot market due to limited supplies of the metal in Russia . 
meanwhile , Tokyo commodity Exchange ( TOCOM ) palladium short positions , amounting to 61 tonnes , remain to be covered , while traders wait for the market to stabilize after the resumption of Russian PGM exports this week . 
Russia supplies about 60 percent of the world &apos;s palladium and 20 percent of its platinum .
