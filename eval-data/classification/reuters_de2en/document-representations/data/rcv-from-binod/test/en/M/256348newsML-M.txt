Sydney wheat futures showed little change on Friday beyond a gain of A $ 4.00 gain in the by January contract to A $ 165.00 a tonne . 
traders said January wheat climbed on the back of a stonger showing in the U.S. and confirmation Australia would supply one million tonnes of wheat to India in the January-February period at or near the Australian Wheat Board estimate of A $ 185 a tonne . 
however , the likelihood of further gains on the back of the sale are doubtful , they said . 
&quot; We operate a domestic market and an export market that are separate , so the impact of this is not all that important , &quot; one trader said .
