researchers have found that women who use powder in their genital area face up to a 50 percent increase in the risk of ovarian cancer . 
the study , published in the American Journal of epidemiology , confirmed similar results of other studies and was the first to look at the relationship between the use of genital deodorant spray and ovarian cancer risk . 
the study , done from 1986 to 1989 by a team from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle , Washington , considered 834 women in the Puget Sound region ranging in age from 20 to 79 . 
the women included 313 who had been diagnosed with ovarian tumours , while the remainder were randomly selected and had no history of ovarian cancer . 
investigators interviewed the women about whether they stored birth-control diaphragms in powder , dusted perineal areas with powder after bathing , powdered sanitary napkins or used genital deodorant sprays . 
the highest increase for risk of ovarian cancer was found in women who dust with powder after bathing , although there was no clear pattern of increasing risk with longer durations of use , said Linda Cook , the epidemiologist who led the study . 
&quot; However , the elevation in risk associated with the use of genital deodorant spray was highest among women who used the sprays for longer periods of time , &quot; she said . 
investigators did not see any increase in risk for developing an ovarian tumour associated with the storing of diaphragms in powder or powdering of sanitary napkins . 
researchers assessed the overall increase in risk at 50 percent after analysing results of the study and adjusting for age of the subjects , but Cook said it was too early to make any public health recommendations to women . 
&quot; We don &apos;t really know what is the constituent in the products that can actually impact the development of ovarian cancer , &quot; she said . 
&quot; We need more research before we can determine a causal relationship . 
she also pointed out that ovarian cancer was extremely rare , on the order of 16 new cases annually per 100,000 women in the study region , meaning that a 50 percent increase in risk might translate to only a few additional cases . 
Cook also said it was possible that the women with ovarian cancer were more likely to have reported exposure to genital powders , but she said she did not think that was likely because the study showed an increased risk for only two of the four types of powder studied .
