he &apos;s older , mellower and pudgier now but Jesse Jackson once again brought thousands of cheering convention delegates and spectators roaring to their feet on Tuesday with his spell-binding &quot; keep hope alive &quot; oratory . 
it was an emotional night for Jackson , who was introduced by his son , Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr . , elected to the House of Representatives from Chicago in a special election earlier this year . 
the senior Jackson , who marched with Martin Luther King Jr . , ran for president twice and never failed to fight for civil rights , has held only one office , a symbolic one as a &quot; shadow senator &quot; from the District of Columbia which has no voting U.S. senators . 
but he was king on Tuesday night when he lighted up a so-far predictable convention with electrifying rhetoric . 
&quot; Keep that faith , &quot; he intoned , voice rising . 
&quot; Stand with the coal miners . 
keep that faith . 
stand with the shipbuilders . 
keep that faith . 
stand with the poor . 
stand with the withered . 
stand tall . 
never surrender your hopes ... keep your faith . 
stand tall Mr. President . 
we will win . 
and deserve to win . 
keep hope alive . 
delegates roared their approval . 
Jackson , whose leftist agenda has often been at odds with Democratic policies in the past , kept hammering away at themes he has espoused during presidential runs in 1984 and 1988 in seeking to become the first black presidential nominee of a major party . 
he urged spending millions of dollars from private pension plans to rebuild decaying inner cities , including that in Chicago he called &quot; a canyon of welfare despair . 
but his message to the convention delegates was to vote and stick with President Bill Clinton , even though there may be disagreements with some of his policies , including his signing of a welfare bill ending more than 60 years of guarantees of a welfare check for the poor . 
Jackson noted that he picketed the White House himself just recently in urging Clinton unsuccessfully against signing the welfare bill . 
but Jackson buried the hatchet on Tuesday night by saying &quot; we must right the wrongs with the bill &quot; and that real &quot; fight was never about welfare . 
it was about jobs and security , &quot; 
and he gave a ringing endorsement to Clinton for re-election . 
&quot; When the president stands for the end of assault weapons , raises the minimum wage , earned income tax credits , stands for mourning the congregations of burned churches , stands for affirmative action and voting rights and social justice and gender equality , he deserves four more years , &quot; Jackson said . 
&quot; And so we disagree on the critical issue like welfare , but then if we elect , there &apos;s another day and a better day , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re mature enough to differ without splitting , &quot; Jackson said . 
&quot; That &apos;s what makes democracy real . 
we must protect one big tent , one big tent .
