Czech National Bank governor Josef Tosovksy said on Thursday that initial government austerity efforts were too little , too late , and that the politicians have yet to prepare Czechs for what lies ahead . 
speaking at a meeting of the German-Czech society in Frankfurt , he said central bank reserves used in a failed effort to defend the Czech crown , which was floated on May 27 , was a &quot; transition tax paid by the public for a market economy &quot; . 
the central bank move to float the currency came after heavy downward pressure from speculators , spurred by a ballooning current account deficit , high wage growth , poor restructuring in Czech industry , and political instability . 
analysts have estimated the central bank used as much as $ 3 billion in its failed efforts last month . 
Tosovsky said that the government &apos;s first attempt at cutting domestic demand in April had been inadequate . 
&quot; The ( April ) package proved to be too little , too late , &quot; he said . 
Tosovsky said that chief challenge in restoring stability to the Czech economy was the reduction in domestic demand . 
&quot; The reduction of domestic demand will be the most important point , but it will be more painful than it was explained to the public , &quot; Tosovsky said . 
after the crown floated the government announced a second package of emergency measures which combined with April measures will cut 45.5 billion crowns from the 1997 original budget . 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has been very critical of the Czech central bank &apos;s tightening of monetary policy in 1996 which he said slowed growth on the supply side much more than the demand side . 
Tosovsky earlier this week took a thinly-veiled shot at Klaus by saying that promises made a rapid wage growth before the 1996 general election raised expectations too much .
