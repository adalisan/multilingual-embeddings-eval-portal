an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) mission on Tuesday praised Poland &apos;s economic performance but said keeping inflation on the decline was crucial to stabilisation and sustained growth . 
&quot; The mission fully supported the macro-economic targets -- 5-6 percent growth , 13 percent inflation and overall external balance -- which the government and the National Bank have set themselves for the next year , &quot; the IMF said in a statement . 
the mission , reviewing Poland &apos;s economy twice a year , said that meeting the targets will require tight fiscal and monetary policies and curbing credit demand from consumers and business . 
&quot; In particular , keeping inflation on a firm declining path would be crucial to continued stabilisation and medium-term growth , requiring containment of credit demands from households , enterprises ... , &quot; it said . 
the mission confirmed other forecasts that the Polish economy is set to grow between five and six percent this year after expanding by seven percent in 1995 . 
it praised the government for cutting annual inflation to 22 percent in 1995 from 30 percent in the previous year but said it was unclear whether this year &apos;s 17 percent target would be achieved . 
finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said on Tuesday inflation in December should be cut to about 18 percent from 19.5 percent in October . 
the mission said Polish financial policies have been prudent , allowing the fiscal deficit to remain this year at a low level of 2.5 percent of gross domestic product . 
it also said the current account deficit , at $ 311 million in the January-September period , should not harm the economy . 
&quot; The mission noted that the emergence of a moderate current account defict , as currently projected , is not abnormal ... and should by easily financeable through foreign direct investment and other long-term capital inflows , &quot; it said . 
it said that the capital inflow will require determination in pursuing structural reforms , such as privatisation and a transformation of the social security system . 
Poland has paid back all IMF loans but the government has requested it to continue reviewing the economy .
