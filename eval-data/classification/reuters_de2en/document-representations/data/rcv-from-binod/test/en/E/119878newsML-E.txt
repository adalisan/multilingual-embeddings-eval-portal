the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said on Wednesday it would set up a three-year emergency programme for Angola of up to $ 75 million . 
&quot; We are talking about an emergency programme of three years which will be funded with our own money and will mean an upfront imbursement , &quot; IMF managing director Michel Camdessus told a news conference in Luanda . 
&quot; We will apply the new emergency programme under the Extended Structural Adjustment Facility which will mean up to 25 percent of the quota of the country , &quot; he said . 
Camdessus told Reuters after the news conference that the country &apos;s quota amounted to $ 300 million . 
he said the programme would be aimed at reconstructing the shattered economy and specifically help re-integrate about 100,000 demobilised Angolan government and rebel troops .
