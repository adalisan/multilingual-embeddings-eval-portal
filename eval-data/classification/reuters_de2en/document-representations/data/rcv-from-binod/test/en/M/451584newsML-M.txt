the key June Japanese government bond futures contract fell sharply on Tuesday due to comments by a senior Bank of Japan official which seemed to imply that the recent surge in JGBs had been overdone , traders said . 
Masayuki Matsushima , director of the BOJ &apos;s research and statistics department , told reporters that the market does not always move in line with economic fundamentals . 
&quot; The market sometimes overshoots , &quot; he said . 
the June ended at 125.95 , down sharply from the previous day &apos;s close of 126.62 . 
turnover was 48,277 contracts . 
Matsushima said there is a theory that long-term interest rates move on expectations regarding inflation , and that theory may be confirmed when the movements of the rates are observed over the long term . 
&quot; We may need more time to assess the basic trend of long-term interest rates , &quot; he said . 
the comments , which reached the market late in the afternoon , suggested that the BOJ wanted to check a further fall in long-term rates and led to selling , traders said . 
the impact on the market is likely to persist , at least in the near-term , a trust bank trader said . 
JGBs had been falling late in the afternoon , even before the BOJ official &apos;s comments came out . 
selling of medium-term cash JGBs were behind the initial fall , a brokerage house trader said . 
earlier in the day , JGBs were pulled down by Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka &apos;s comments which said that a government scheme for improving land liquidity will be announced at the end of March . 
Mitsuzuka said he was told by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Tuesday to draw up the plan . 
&quot; If we make effective use of land , it is true that this will have an impact on solving problem loans quickly for financial firms , &quot; Mitsuzuka said . 
traders said the impact from Mitsuzuka &apos;s announcement was limited , however , as no specific details were yet available . 
&quot; Until the details are released it will be hard to decide how much to sell based on this news alone , &quot; a trader for a trust bank &apos;s securities unit said . 
one key for the market in the near term will be whether investors decide to buy cash JGBs on dips , the trust bank trader said . 
&quot; Market players were saying that if JGBs fell to below 126.00 , investors would probably decide to buy cash bonds , &quot; he said . 
the market will be focusing on whether such buying actually emerges or not , he said .
