Ukraine &apos;s annual inflation will be 15-16 percent in 1997 , higher than previously estimated but below 1996 &apos;s 39.7 percent , Economy Minister Yuri Yekhanurov said on Friday . 
he had previously predicted annual inflation at about 10 percent this year . 
&quot; Since we must raise electricity rates and will do this soon , we suggest this will speed up inflation by 3.5 percent which will bring it to 15-16 percent for the whole year , &quot; he told reporters . 
energy Ministry officials said this week they planned to raise power rates by 30 percent for residential consumers and 12 percent for industrial sector users . 
June inflation stood at 0.1 percent .
