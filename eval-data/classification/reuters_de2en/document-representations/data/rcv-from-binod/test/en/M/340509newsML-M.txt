Hungarian overnight rates edged up on Wednesday as some banks apparently ran out of liquidity after putting their money into the reverse repo facility , dealers said . 
&quot; They probably have some funds tied up in the ( central bank &apos;s ) reverse repo facility , &quot; said Norbert Kaplar of Corvinbank . 
overnight rates closed at 21.875 percent , up from Tuesday &apos;s close of 21.50 percent . 
Kaplar added that overnight rates would either remain at current levels or could even rise to between 22 and 22.50 percent , depending on banks &apos; liquidity .
