Sweden posted price falls for the second consecutive month on Thursday with a lower-than-expected consumer price figure ( CPI ) for November but economists saw the price falls as temporary . 
consumer prices slipped 0.3 percent in November from October giving an annualised fall of 0.3 percent . 
the market had expected a 0.1 percent dip , according to a Reuters poll . 
but economists said the falls , the first seen in Sweden for 37 years , were temporary , pointing to underlying inflation of 0.7 percent in October and forecasting inflation , albeit low , from January next year . 
&quot; We should see positive figures in January , but inflation is likely to remain below one percent until next summer , &quot; Bengt Hansson , senior economist at Handelsbanken , told Reuters . 
the trend began in October when Sweden &apos;s Central Statistics Bureau ( SCB ) reported unchanged CPI giving a price fall of 0.1 percent compared with 2.7 percent inflation a year earlier . 
the SCB attributed the fall in November mainly to lower mortgage rates and lower value added tax ( VAT ) on food that took effect in January this year . 
but as the effect of the VAT cut will cease on January 1 , 1997 , economists expected inflation to resume after a third month of price falls in December . 
Sweden &apos;s CPI is unique as it includes mortgage interest rates and 1.2 percentage points of the November downturn stemmed from lower interest rates following the Riksbank &apos;s aggressive rate cutting this year . 
&quot; The main reason for the drop in consumer prices is falling interest rates , which are good for the economy , &quot; Olle Djerf , economist at banking group Nordbanken , told Reuters . 
some economists argue that a few months of falling prices could more firmly establish Sweden as a country with low inflation , which in turn could prompt interest rates to fall further . 
&quot; It will help establish Sweden as a low-inflation country with a long-term low inflation and low wage increases , &quot; Hansson said . 
the central bank &apos;s ( Riksbank ) inflation target is two percent with a flexibility of one percentage point either way . 
&quot; During periods of slow economic growth , inflation should be allowed to be lower than two percent and in periods with strong economic trends it should be allowed to be higher than two percent , &quot; said Djerf , dismissing any negative effects of the current figures . 
Djerf forecast inflation will rise to two percent at the end of next year with 1997 inflation averaging one percent . 
economists said the continuing low inflationary figures boded well for further cuts to the Riksbank &apos;s key interest rate , the repo rate which began the year at 8.91 percent but now stands at 4.35 percent . 
many economists expect the Riksbank to lower the repo rate further , forecasting it will bottom out at below four percent . 
the November figure underpinned expectations for another cut next Tuesday when the Riksbank will also present its last inflation report for the year . 
&quot; We expect the Riksbank to respond ( to CPI figures ) by cutting the repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.10 percent next Tuesday , &quot; James Mckay at Painewebber said in a statement .
