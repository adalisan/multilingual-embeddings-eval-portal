European stocks perked up in early trading on Wednesday with optimism generated by Wall Street &apos;s record close overnight outweighing fears of higher interest rates . 
on the currency front , the dollar edged up slightly against the mark and yen but markets were mostly content to bide their time ahead of important U.S. economic data due later this week . 
London , Europe &apos;s biggest stock exchange , climbed 0.25 percent after a lacklustre performance on Tuesday but trading was cautious despite New York &apos;s late rally because of interest rate anxiety and Wall Street &apos;s recent volatility . 
&quot; It &apos;s a predictable mark up after Wall Street , &quot; the head of trading at a large investment bank said . 
&quot; The spectre of higher interest rates will keep the market on its toes so I wouldn &apos;t look for any dramatic gains today . 
market talk of higher British interest rates intensified after the deputy governor of the Bank of England late on Tuesday said there was a need for a small rate rise to achieve the government &apos;s inflation target . 
&quot; There is talk around the market this morning that we could see a rate hike as early as next week , &quot; the trader said . 
other European bourses made a good start after Wall Street &apos;s strong showing but the mood was edgy because of worries that record-breaking levels of recent weeks could not be sustained much longer . 
in New York , the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 6,600 points for the first time on Tuesday but bonds fell on fears that the U.S. economy might be growing so fast that the Federal Reserve central bank might be prompted to raise rates . 
the Dow ended up 33.48 points at a record 6,600.66 , surpassing Monday &apos;s peak of 6,567.18 . 
&quot; The bond market is telling us that U.S. interest rates are going up but so far Wall Street is ignoring the bonds , &quot; one trader said in London . 
French stocks put on the strongest performance , climbing nearly one percent at the opening on the back of Wall Street , but the advance slowed slightly by mid-morning . 
brokers said investors were feeling cautious ahead of two important U.S. indicators due out on Thursday and Friday , the December producer price index and the unemployment rate , which would give pointers on the health of the U.S. economy . 
in Frankfurt , shares climbed by 0.5 percent but again traders said many investors were sitting on the fence ahead of the U.S. price and jobs data . 
&quot; The steady dollar and a higher Wall Street are helping today , &quot; said one dealer . 
there was little concerted buying , however , because of the upcoming American statistics . 
the dollar climbed slightly against the mark and yen by mid-morning although business was slack ahead of the U.S. data . 
it traded well above 115 yen and dealers said there were no new comments from Japanese officials about the yen &apos;s value . 
recent warnings about the negative impact of a weaker yen have pushed the currency higher . 
&quot; Dollar / yen continues to trade in a nervous fashion and in the short term the odds favour a further correction to below the 115 level , &quot; said Paul Meggyesi , currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
a more than one-percent fall in the Nikkei stock index , after a near three-percent drop on Tuesday , had little impact . 
the mark drifted against other European currencies with the market awaiting Thursday &apos;s release of German December unemployment data . 
the dollar was quoted around 1.5691 marks and 115.67 yen compared with 1.5634 and 115.25 in late European trade on Tuesday . 
the FTSE 100 index of key British shares was 5.4 points higher at 4,084.2 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 index was up 19.98 at 2,321.68 . 
gold was fixed at $ 355.80 an ounce , well below Tuesday &apos;s London close of $ 359.35 . 
silver was at $ 4.66 , down six cents .
