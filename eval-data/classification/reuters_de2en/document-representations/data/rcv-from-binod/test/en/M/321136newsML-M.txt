major Slovak shares closed mixed in flat trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange ( BSE ) on Tuesday , as the SAX index edged up 0.04 points to 189.03 . 
oil refinery Slovnaft closed down 10 at 840 , but its average price -- on which the index is calculated -- firmed 0.12 percent . 
steel maker VSZ closed unchanged at 640 crowns , while both oil and gas storage company Nafta and commercial bank VUB did not trade on Tuesday . 
&quot; It was a normal session with no surprises , generally only confirming the latest development on the market , &quot; said Radovan Dzugas of Creditanstalt . 
&quot; I think the price growth in Slovnaft is well-supported by the company &apos;s performance . 
it has the potential to rise further as it is an attractive share to long-term investors , who apparently would not let it fall in price , &quot; he added . 
overall volume increased to 664,542 shares , from 441,392 shares traded on Monday , while turnover rose to 304.42 million crowns , from 237.51 million .
