President Bill Clinton was set to announce additional members of his new administration on Friday , with sources saying he was expected to keep his treasury secretary and attorney general . 
Clinton was to meet on Friday with a few additional members of his administration , including Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Environmental Protection Agency head Carol Browner -- and make announcements at a 2 p.m. est 1900 GMT news conference . 
Clinton , who has been working on shaping the team that will serve him when he starts his second term in January , was intentionally vague about what decisions he intends to announce -- although much of his attention has been on the economic team he wants . 
he met privately on Thursday night in the Oval Office with Attorney General Janet Reno and told aides they had a &quot; wonderful meeting . 
&quot; Senior advisers said they expected Reno to remain in Clinton &apos;s Cabinet . 
since Clinton won re-election on Nov . 5 , seven Cabinet members have said that they plan to depart , including the commerce and labour secretaries . 
two key economic advisers are also leaving : Laura Tyson , who heads the National Economic Council , and Joseph Stiglitz , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers . 
administration officials said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy , Lawrence Summers , were expected to remain in their jobs . 
administration officials consider both men strong and effective advocates for Clinton &apos;s economic policies . 
White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry , noting that Clinton has been considering several major posts in his new administration , sought to downplay speculation about specific announcements . 
&quot; There are a lot of things in play for tomorrow and I don &apos;t know what the outcome will be , &quot; McCurry said Thursday . 
a source familiar with the president &apos;s thinking said he would be &quot; very surprised &quot; if Reno did not remain in the Cabinet . 
&quot; If she wants to stay , I &apos;m sure she can , &quot; another official said . 
questions about Reno &apos;s job security have arisen because of her independent streak , which has often irked the White House . 
some Clinton aides have also complained that she has been too quick to bow to partisan calls for independent counsel probes . 
representative Bill Richardson , a New Mexico Democrat who has led a string of high-profile missions to rescue U.S. citizens detained abroad , has been under consideration to be commerce secretary . 
the Washington Post reported on Friday that William Daley , a prominent Democratic figure and brother of Chicago Mayor Richard Daley , was under consideration for the commerce post . 
former Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania and White House aide Alexis Herman have been cited as candidates for labour secretary . 
Wofford was seen at the White House on Thursday . 
Clinton last week unveiled his foreign policy team as a group , and White House officials said at the time that he was likely to do so with his economic team , saying the &quot; chemistry &quot; among them was critical . 
with vacancies for chairman of the president &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers and for the post of head of the National Economic Council , administration officials have contacted Alan blinder , a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , about returning to the White House . 
blinder , reportedly reluctant about returning to Washington , met on Thursday with the incoming White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles -- who also had been hesitant to return to the White House but bowed to Clinton &apos;s request . 
blinder left his job at the Federal Reserve in January to return to teaching at Princeton University .
