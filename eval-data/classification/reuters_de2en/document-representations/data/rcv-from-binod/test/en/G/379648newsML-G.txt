United Nations refugee agency chief Sadako Ogata appealed on Friday for the urgent demilitarisation of Rwandan Hutus in eastern Zaire &apos;s biggest refugee settlement which she said was now next to the war zone . 
Ogata , on a tour of Africa &apos;s troubled Great Lakes region , said the frontline between warring rebels and Zairean troops in the Lubutu region had moved close to the Hutu refugee camp of Tingi-Tingi and called for a political solution . 
&quot; The frontline now is in Tingi-Tingi . 
the situation is very grave , &quot; UNHCR spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume quoted Ogata as saying before she left Uganda for neighbouring Tanzania on the last leg of her week-long tour . 
rebel activity around Lubutu has led to an exodus of Zaireans from nearby villages . 
almost 200,000 trapped Hutu refugees are clustered around the village of Tingi-Tingi but the rebel leader has ordered his forces to avoid the camp . 
Berthiaume could not say just how close Tingi-Tingi was to the fighting . 
UNHCR had no reports of refugees fleeing Tingi-Tingi yet or details of the military situation . 
Ogata appealed to the fighters not to attack the refugees . 
the refugee camp has to be civilian and must not be used for military reasons and must not be attacked . 
but the reality on the ground is different , &quot; Berthiaume quoted her as saying . 
Ogata said a separation of refugees from extremist Hutu militia and former Rwandan government soldiers -- responsible for the 1994 Hutu-led genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda and now fighting for a military comeback -- was needed urgently . 
&quot; This is not for the UNHCR to do , neither for other relief organisations . 
we cannot solve this problem on our own . 
we insist on a political solution , &quot; Ogata said . 
Berthiaume said Tingi-Tingi , housing 160,000 Rwandan Hutus , was next to an airstrip being used by Zaireans to deliver military supplies . 
a second settlement has sprung up next to the camp , housing some 30,000 Hutus who fled the nearby camp of Amisi after rebels seized the area .
