the Tunis Stock Exchange index on Monday closed 1.92 percent lower at 509.39 points from 519.37 on Friday due mainly to a decline in Amen Bank at the start of computerised trading in the share , bourse sources said . 
total bourse volume was 721,750 dinars against 956,064 dinars on Friday . 
amen Bank lost 10.52 dinars to 47.98 dinars . 
brokers said that under the previous system , in which share prices were displayed on a blackboard , price movements were much less transparent . 
with computerised trading there is greater transparency as every price movement is registered . 
most computerised shares drop sharply when they make the switch . 
since last October , the Exchange has gradually introduced computerised dealing for listed firms and the system now includes 26 out of 31 shares in the index . 
chemical firm Al-Kimia was up 0.5 dinar to 46 dinars on Monday . 
household firm Ateliers Mecaniques du Sahel was down 0.41 dinar to 13.34 dinars .
