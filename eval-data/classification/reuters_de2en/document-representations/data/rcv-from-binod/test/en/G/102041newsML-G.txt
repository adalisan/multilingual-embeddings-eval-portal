the black opposition Inkatha Freedom Party vowed on Tuesday to fight South Africa &apos;s new constitution if it was adopted over its objections and said it might revive a demand for international mediation . 
&quot; If ( the constitution ) is adopted by the assembly , we would have to revert to other tactics , &quot; Ben Skosana , Inkatha parliamentary caucus chairman , told a news conference . 
&quot; Before this new South Africa , we had a constitution which was written by a minority and was not accepted by the majority . 
and the majority did not just sit back and fold their arms , &quot; Skosana said . 
the Zulu-based party , led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi , quit constitutional negotiations 18 months ago in protest at the failure of the ruling African National Congress to honour an agreement on international mediation over their constitutional differences . 
the Constitutional Assembly approved a constitution in May but last month the country &apos;s highest court sent parts of it back to the assembly for revision . 
Inkatha took the opportunity to return to the negotiations last week but on Monday it quit the process again , saying there was no room for all-party agreement . 
a vote is expected on the final blueprint in the Constitutional Assembly on Friday . 
Skosana declined to elaborate on what action Inkatha would take , saying this would have to be referred to the party &apos;s National Council for a decision . 
but he said one option would be reviving Inkatha &apos;s demand for international mediation . 
&quot; It is one of the important steps we want to take . 
it may be imperative now to take it , &quot; Skosana told Reuters after the briefing . 
&quot; We will continue to find ways to change ( the constitution ) to accommodate our views . 
Inkatha negotiators said they still hoped for an 11th-hour breakthrough and would meet Constitutional Assembly chairman Cyril Ramaphosa -- also the ANC &apos;s secretary-general -- this week . 
the crux of Inkatha &apos;s demands is the role of traditional leaders , an influential core of its largely rural support base in the Zulu heartland of KwaZulu-Natal , where it won a majority in the 1994 general election . 
the ANC insists all members of a local council must be elected but Inkatha wants a guaranteed role for traditional leaders , with an even balance of power between elected and non- elected local leaders .
