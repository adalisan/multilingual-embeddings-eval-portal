PALMERSTON North , Oct 24 - New Zealand Maori coach Cameron Bell picks the kiwis to wrap up the three-test rugby league series against Great Britain in a tight second contest here at the Manawatu Showgrounds on Friday night , NZPA reports . 
bell &apos;s Maori team notched a historic first ever win over the Great Britain in Whangarei on Tuesday night giving him the rare personal distinction of having achieved two wins as coach over the Lions . 
his previous success was with Auckland . 
&quot; I think it will be close again and I believe it might go the way of the kiwis because they have the edge of being one-up in the series , &quot; Bell said . 
&quot; It depends too on how hungry Great Britain are to level it from here . 
but Bell said he expected kiwis coach Frank Endacott to keep ramming home the urgency and need for New Zealand to make it two-nil ahead of going to Christchurch . 
new Zealand have not beaten Great Britain in a series since 1984 and that has been a bug bear for Endacott ever since he took over coaching the kiwis three years ago . 
&quot; This is a very good Great Britain side , sure they &apos;ve got some players who aren &apos;t here for various reasons and they do seem to be missing them , but this is still a very good side , &quot; Bell warned . 
it is for that reason he expects Endacott to spend another tense 80-minutes in the stands when the kiwis front up for the second test . 
&quot; I do believe the British guys who are here are good enough to beat New Zealand in the last two tests if they get a sniff at it , &quot; Bell said . 
&quot; I know they will be competitive and we have to expect that . 
they were competitive right up until the last 10-minutes of that first test . 
Endacott himself spoke of the need to wrap up the series here in Palmerston North . 
&quot; There &apos;s more riding on this test than there was in the first test , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We have to wrap up this series here before going to Christchurch , we &apos;ve taken one step toward it and we must complete that process here . 
&quot; We don &apos;t want to have to go to the third test tied at 1-1 , it will make the job all the more harder . 
new Zealand have enjoyed a relatively injury-free build-up to the second test with only minor niggles affecting some of the players . 
in contrast Great Britain go into the test with centre Daryl Powell &apos;s hamstring still a concern while halfback Bobbie Goulding , who played the role of concert conductor for Great Britain in the first test , still has a suspect knee .
