proceeds from the $ 200 million of tax-exempt fixed-rate bond sale will go toward the city &apos;s capital improvement program . 
the sale was previously announced as totaling between $ 200 million and $ 300 million , a city official said . 
the official , who declined to be named , added neither transaction would include an overseas sale .
