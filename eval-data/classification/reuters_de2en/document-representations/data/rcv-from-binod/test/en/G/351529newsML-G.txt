German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will take up the issue of the Church of Scientology , which is charging Germany with persecuting its members , with new U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , his ministry said on Monday . 
Kinkel told the Frankfurter Rundschau daily newspaper that Bonn refused to accept the U.S.-based Church &apos;s charge that compared Bonn &apos;s tough stance with Nazi persecution of the Jews before World War Two . 
a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Kinkel would take up the issue with Albright , who is scheduled to visit Bonn on February 16 and 17 on her first overseas trip since taking aoffice in January . 
the Frankfurter Rundschau quoted Kinkel in a report , released ahead of Tuesday publication , as saying that measures were only being taken against individuals or organisations that violated the law . 
Sabine Weber , a Church of Scientology spokeswoman in Germany contacted by Reuters , said his remarks were &quot; outrageous &quot; . 
&quot; It is unbelievable that the German government wants to close it eyes to its discrimination and tell the rest of the world that hundreds of documented cases of discrimination do not exist , &quot; she said . 
&quot; It &apos;s outrageous to say members of scientology have acted illegally . 
there have been no violations of the law , &quot; she said . 
the U.S. State Department &apos;s annual human rights survey documented Scientologists &apos; allegations of persecution and discrimination in Germany . 
a senior State Department official said the survey represented Washington &apos;s &quot; serious concern &quot; over the issue . 
but Kinkel argued that Germany was right not to accord Scientology the status of a religion , believing it to be an economic organisation which exploits its members to make profits from expensive self-improvement courses . 
he said its criticism of Germany was absurd and argued that Scientology , a religious philosophy founded in 1954 by U.S. science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard , was also controversial in the United States , according to the newspaper . 
it quoted Kinkel as saying the Church of Scientology had singled out Germany for a campaign because it was a soft target due to its Nazi past but also because it was a big and potentially lucrative market . 
the southern state of Bavaria has been at the forefront of the fight against Scientology , excluding companies run by Scientologists from public tenders and asking applicants for public sector jobs whether they belong to the group . 
it has also placed Scientology under observation by the state &apos;s anti-extremist watchdog .
