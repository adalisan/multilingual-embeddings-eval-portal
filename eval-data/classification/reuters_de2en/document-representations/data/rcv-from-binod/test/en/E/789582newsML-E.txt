Japan &apos;s contentious surplus in its current account -- the broadest measure of trade in goods and services -- rose 55.8 percent in June from a year earlier to 1.02 trillion yen amid growing fears of renewed trade friction . 
the Finance Ministry said on Friday that the surplus in merchandise trade alone rose 18.7 percent in June from the same month a year earlier to 1.1 trillion yen . 
at Friday &apos;s rate of around 119 yen to the dollar , the current account surplus in June stood at $ 8.5 billion and the merchandise trade surplus was $ 9.2 billion . 
the rise had been widely anticipated as Japan &apos;s customs-cleared trade surplus for June , which was announced last month , showed a 27.7 percent rise . 
the trade surplus within the current account category , calculated on different basis , differs slightly from the customs-cleared trade surplus . 
operators in financial markets have paid close attention to the trend in Japan &apos;s current account surplus after it soared 155 percent in May and 93 percent in April . 
fears of trade tension between the United States and Japan grew this week when U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said U.S. officials were concerned that car exports to Japan had decreased and the trade deficit with Japan in general was deteriorating .
