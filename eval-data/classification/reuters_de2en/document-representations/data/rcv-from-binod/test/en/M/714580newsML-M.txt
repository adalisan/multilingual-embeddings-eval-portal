the gold market found a foothold on Tuesday after losing nearly $ 15 per ounce in a slide that began last Thursday . 
but market analysts said gold &apos;s downtrend would take some stopping and forecast target prices under $ 300 an ounce being visited within three months . 
&quot; These markets ( the precious metals ) have been going sideways for so long that now a trend has started it will be very significant , &quot; said technical analyst Fran Skelley at Credit Suisse First Boston . 
gold was fixed at $ 317.60 , against $ 318.00 on Monday afternoon and more than $ 334.00 a week ago . 
dealers said the market was still very soft amid signs that further losses were to come . 
&quot; If you look on the order sheet there is no ( physical ) buying under the market even at these low prices . 
in fact , there is a bit of selling from the physical players , &quot; one dealer said . 
the New York market , which re-opened on Monday after the U.S. 
independence Day holiday , fell sharply to come into line with lower values established in Asia and Europe on Monday . 
further selling took the Tokyo and Hong Kong markets slightly lower before Europe opened . 
but dealers said prices were contained in a narrow range and there was no immediate direction to trade . 
the gold price , which has been under pressure all year from the threat of central bankers selling gold from their reserves , finally cracked last Thursday when the Reserve Bank of Australia announced it had sold 167 tonnes of gold from its reserves during the previous six months . 
the shockwaves from that were amplified by Australia being the world &apos;s third largest gold producer . 
&quot; If ever a move could have been calculated to extinguish what flickering flame of investor hope remained , then this was it , &quot; said analyst Nick Moore at Flemings Global Mining Group . 
the bearishness began to impact the other precious metals on Monday and continued on Tuesday . 
silver was heavily sold down 20 cents to $ 4.24 / $ 4.26 and the slump in platinum prices continued with a fall to $ 405.00 / $ 408.00 from Monday &apos;s $ 410.50 / $ 414.50 . 
palladium was at $ 174.00 / $ 177.00 from $ 181.70 / $ 185.70 .
