Brazilian Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola said policy-makers would continue to lower interest rates next month because there were no signs of an overheating economy , Gazeta Mercantil reported . 
&quot; We don &apos;t see demand getting out of control , and any attempt to put the brakes on economic growth to benefit the export sector will be very disruptive , which would not be appropriate now , &quot; Loyola told Gazeta in an interview . 
Brazil &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee will meet Wednesday to set the Central Bank &apos;s basic monthly interest rate , known as the TBC , for February . 
January &apos;s TBC rate was set at 1.70 percent and policy-makers have been lowering the rate by three to four basis points a month . 
Loyola also said the government would monitor the effects of a new tax on financial transactions , known as the CPMF , over the next 15 days . 
the tax , which takes effect this week , was expected to lead to an outflow in short-term bank funds into checking and savings accounts . 
Loyola said this new environment would probably lead to an alteration in current bank reserve requirements . 
&quot; We can increase some requirements and lower others where its needed . 
but it &apos;s still too early to say , &quot; Loyola said . 
he added that lowering some reserve requirements would help bring high interest rates charged by banks in line with the TBC rate . 
the TBC has fallen much more rapidly than bank rates , primarily because banks have had to charge for higher risk due to a wave of consumer bankruptices in 1995 and 1996 , Loyola said .
