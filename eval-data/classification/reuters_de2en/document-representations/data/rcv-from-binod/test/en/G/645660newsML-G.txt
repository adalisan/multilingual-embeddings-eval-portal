two people were killed when rebel gunmen attacked a camp for displaced persons at Mitakataka , 30 km ( 20 miles ) north of Bujumbura , and set camp buildings on fire , Burundi radio reported on Sunday . 
hundreds of camp inmates fled into the surrounding countryside after the attack on Saturday , the radio said , and 200 were still missing on Sunday . 
the radio said the attackers were rebels . 
there were about 2,000 people in the camp . 
after a similar attack last year , most of the inmates fled into nearby eastern Zaire ( now renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo ) returning to Burundi early this year after fighting erupted in eastern Zaire between the forces of Laurent Kabila and then president Mobutu Sese Seko . 
more than 150,000 people have been killed in massacres and clashes between Burundi &apos;s Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels since the assassination of the country &apos;s first Hutu president , Melchior Ndadaye , in 1993 . 
Burundi &apos;s leader , Pierre Buyoya , who took power in a military coup last year , recently announced that his government had provisionally agreed on a cease-fire with the Hutu rebel group , the National Council for the Defence of Democracy ( CNDD ) after talks in Rome . 
regional African states have imposed an economic blockade on Burundi in a bid to force a return to constitutional rule .
