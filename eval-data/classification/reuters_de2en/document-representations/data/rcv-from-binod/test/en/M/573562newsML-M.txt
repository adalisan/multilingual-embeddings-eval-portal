Singapore fuel oil swaps extended its early day rally late afternoon on Friday on expectations of large physical demand and tight supplies , traders said . 
&quot; The front month is really strong . 
people think that there &apos;s not going to be much oil in June and demand is picking up , &quot; said a trader . 
may fuel oil swaps were last quoted at $ 103.50 / $ 104.50 per tonne , up from Thursday &apos;s $ 101.50 / $ 102.50 , brokers said . 
may traded earlier in the day at $ 103.00 , 103.75 and $ 104.00 per tonne , they said . 
June swaps also saw some sharp gains and were last quoted at $ 102.00 / $ 103.00 , from Thursday &apos;s $ 99.50 / $ 100.50 , brokers said . 
June traded earlier in the day at $ 102 . 
traders said the market took off after a local trader bought a 20,000 tonne cargo from a European major late Thursday at $ 102 per tonne for May 26-30 lifting , up $ 2 from Tuesday &apos;s traded level . 
the market is expecting the local trader to begin a new round of large purchases which will drive prices up , traders said . 
the local trader had shipped a large Middle East cargo to Singapore due to arrive later this month , they said . 
the swaps market began picking up mid-week on expectations of this buying binge and levels took off on Friday . 
firmer prices were also caused by reduced exports from the Middle East due to high domestic summer demand and tight supplies from South Korea due to maintenance shutdown . 
the market was also boosted by a 53 cents jump in overnight June Brent crude prices which closed at $ 18.69 per barrel , the market was last traded up six cents . 
the firmer crude market led to higher gas oil prices with May last quoted $ 25.40 / $ 25.50 per barrel , up about 10 cents . 
brokers said May was traded earlier in the day at $ 25.45 and $ 25.60 per barrel . 
the May / June spread narrowed further to value at about 40 cents from around 45 cents on Thursday .
