after years of fighting on opposite sides of the political divide , two South African politicians pledged on Sunday to create a new political movement . 
Roelf Meyer , estranged ally of South Africa &apos;s former president F.W. 
de Klerk , and Bantu Holomisa , a popular politician recently thrown out of President Nelson Mandela &apos;s African National Congress , told a press conference they now shared a common goal . 
&quot; ( We want ) ... to inform the public that the NCF ( National Consultative Forum ) and the NMP ( New Movement Process ) are launching a joint committee to work together so as to realise our objective , that of forming a new political party in South Africa , &quot; Holomisa , flanked by Meyer , told reporters . 
he said the committee would investigate matters of common interest , including strategy , policy and funding , ahead of the establishment of a new movement later this year . 
Meyer said , &quot; We need to consult South Africans on policy and our political platform in order to create a party with an an eye to the future , particularly with the vision to the 1999 elections . 
&quot; The chief objective in ( our ) minds is to structure a new political movement which is non-racial . 
Meyer , a co-architect of the country &apos;s first post-apartheid constitution , quit parliament last month after his resignation from the National Party on May 17 , over its resistance to his suggestions for change . 
the National Party created apartheid under Hendrik Verwoerd , but decades later under de Klerk it led South Africa &apos;s transition to black rule by unbanning the ANC and releasing Mandela from jail . 
Holomisa fell from favour with the ANC last year after making public bribery allegations against a colleague and then refusing to apologise . 
Meyer and Holomisa said they would talk to other parties . 
&quot; We are free now and we don &apos;t belong to any political parties . 
if they do not want to be involved ( in the process ) now , then there &apos;s a view that after we &apos;ve formed a party together we will then consider a question of forming alliances , &quot; Holomisa said .
