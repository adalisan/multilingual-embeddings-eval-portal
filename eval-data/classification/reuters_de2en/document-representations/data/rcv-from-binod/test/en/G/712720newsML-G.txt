Bosnian Serb leader Biljana Plavsic on Tuesday rebuffed an offer by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to mediate in her power struggle with hardline nationalists . 
the independent Belgrade news agency beta quoted Plavsic &apos;s supporters as saying she had &quot; nothing to discuss &quot; with Milosevic and considered him responsible for &quot; the destruction of everything worthy in Serbdom . 
Milosevic invited the Bosnian Serb president and her rival Momcilo Krajisnik , the Serb member of Bosnia &apos;s multi-ethnic collective presidency , to Belgrade for talks to resolve their feud and ensure the progress of the Bosnian peace agreement . 
Plavsic and Bosnian Serb hardline nationalists led by Krajisnik and ex-President Radovan Karazdic , an indicted war criminal , have been locked in a power struggle for more than a week since she accused them of corruption . 
Tanjug news agency quoted Milosevic as saying the &quot; crisis must be solved through cooperation . 
Plavsic supporters believe however that the Serbian leader has rebuilt links with Karadzic and his allies since he forced them to sign the peace agreement against their will in 1995 . 
NATO leaders meeting in Madrid said Plavsic had acted legally when she dissolved the Bosnian Serb parliament last week and demanded her decisions be respected . 
&quot; We will not tolerate any recourse to force or violence , or the unauthorised deployment of military or paramilitary force , &quot; an alliance statement said . 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana discussed the crisis in telephone talks with Carlos Westendorp , a fellow Spaniard and the international High Representative to Bosnia . 
Plavsic accused Karadzic &apos;s circle of plundering Serb territory through smuggling rackets and has advocated cooperation with major powers enforcing a peace agreement in Bosnia . 
with parliament dissolved , Plavsic will soon have the option of forming a new government . 
diplomats said two competing authorities in Serb territory could emerge , one in the west and one directed by Karadzic in the east . 
she won promises from Bosnian Serb army generals on Tuesday that they would remain neutral in the conflict after talks in the northwest town of Banja Luka . 
the army general staff reiterated its stand that it would not take sides in the feud but respected Plavsic &apos;s legal role as supreme commander . 
purged by hardliners and lacking financial support , the army is overshadowed by a well-funded , large police force controlled by Karadzic . 
U.S. peacekeeping soldiers reported they had seized illegal weapons and ammunition from Bosnian Serb special police loyal to Karadzic . 
international police monitors found the weapons on Monday during an inspection of a special police station in the northern town of Brcko in Serb-controlled territory , U.N. spokesman Alex Ivanko said . 
the special police are led by Interior Minister Dragan Kijac who is at the heart of the power struggle . 
Plavsic precipitated a confrontation with Karadzic and his allies more than a week ago when she tried to suspend Kijac . 
Plavsic dissolved parliament last week and called for new elections on September 1 . 
the hardliners dismissed her decision and held a session of assembly anyway , rewriting laws to enable her recall and to strip her of defence powers . 
the turmoil among Serb leaders has fuelled speculation that major powers are preparing to arrest Karadzic , who was forced out of public office last year as an indicted war criminal but retains covert influence .
