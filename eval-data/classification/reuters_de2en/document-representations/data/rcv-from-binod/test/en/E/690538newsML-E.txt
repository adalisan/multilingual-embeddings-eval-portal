French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Thursday the new Socialist government would reconcile conflicting demands of supporting growth , cutting unemployment and at the same time controlling public finances . 
Jospin told the Senate , the upper house of parliament , the question was not only one of controlling central state finances but also a social security deficit which &quot; may be a serious concern &quot; . 
Jospin said it was too soon to respond to specific questions about the governments plans until the results of an audit of public finances was presented on July 21 and that more precise answers would be given in the autumn budget debate . 
he also said that , while there were some signs of a pick up , economic growth was &quot; still fragile &quot; .
