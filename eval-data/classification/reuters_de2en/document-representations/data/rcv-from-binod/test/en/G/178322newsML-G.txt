a teddy bear lay among belongings scattered through the burned-out remains of one of the biggest refugee camps in eastern Zaire . 
some bodies of refugees mowed down as they were fleeing fighting between the central African country &apos;s government forces and Tutsi-led rebels littered the camp . 
Katale camp , the former home to 200,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees , stood destroyed and deserted . 
the refugees who for two years lived in the camp 50 km ( 30 miles ) north of Goma city after fleeing Rwanda have fled again . 
some 300 of those who stayed behind and hid crossed into Rwanda at a nearby border point on Sunday , their feet cut from walking on volcanic rock , U.N. refugee spokesman Peter Kessler said in Nairobi . 
among them were walking wounded who said Hutu militiamen , insisting they follow the camp &apos;s other inhabitants westwards , had shot at them for disobeying . 
others had been shot dead , the refugees said . 
&quot; They said they had been eating grass , tubers and weeds . 
in the last few days they had put mud into their clothing and squeezed it to get water , &quot; Kessler said . 
Katale and its two neighbours Kahindo and Kibumba , just three of some 40 camps that had housed more than a million people , are deserted except for the odd looter . 
the population took flight 10 days after fighting flared between troops and rebels who say they want to overthrow President Mobutu Sese Seko . 
bamboo huts and shelters were burned out , buildings looted and destroyed , and possessions strewn everywhere . 
only debris remains -- broken machetes , dead rats and the crushed teddy bear lying in the mud . 
the rebels , who have been supported by troops from Rwanda &apos;s Tutsi-led army , control the area now and a roadblock manned by heavily armed men , some in civilian clothes , some in military garb , bars the road further northwards . 
to the south , on the road to Goma , lie burned-out cars , vans and buses that look as if they were ambushed as refugees tried to flee in them away from the rebels . 
more bodies lie alongside them decaying , some covered in maggots . 
there are , however , signs of life on the road . 
Three-score refugees were slowly traipsing down the road towards rebel-held Goma on the border with Rwanda . 
&quot; We are some of the very few refugees who have left the forests around here , to try to go to Rwanda , &quot; Denis Manibaho said . 
&quot; There are many dead in the forests , they were killed during the combat and there are people who are ill because we have no food or water . 
the camps were in a parched area , and aid workers used to truck water in from the nearest lake some 30 km ( 20 miles ) away . 
most of the Hutus have fled to the west along with the armed militiamen who committed the genocide in 1994 of up to a million minority Tutsis or moderate Hutus but lost the war . 
the outside world agrees with Zaire and Rwanda that the refugees should go home , but they do not trust Rwanda &apos;s pledge of fair treatment . 
the refugees on the road near the three deserted camps said that the Hutu gunmen had all departed in the direction of Mugunga , a vast camp some 15 km ( nine miles ) from Goma where they are holding out against the rebels . 
heading to their uncertain future -- but perhaps a better one than that facing their million compatriots stuck on the other side of the lines , bereft of any aid -- they passed mile after mile of discarded clothing , shoes , plastic sheeting , as well as cartridge cases and mortar casings . 
nearer Goma , more people wander along the road , scavenging for food .
