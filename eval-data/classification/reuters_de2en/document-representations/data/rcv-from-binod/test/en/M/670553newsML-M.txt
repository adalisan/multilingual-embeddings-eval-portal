KCBT hard red winter wheat futures settled lower in moderate volumes amid mounting hedge pressure from expanding harvest activity , traders said . 
but values quietly came under pressure on scattered hedge-selling tied to harvest in the southern and central U.S. Plains , and the selling picked up momentum going into the close , traders said . 
a separate feature in Wednesday &apos;s session was heavy spread activity as funds rolled their short positions out of front-month July , traders said . 
&quot; The market is going lower to find ( export ) business . 
but the feature is that it &apos;s a big rolling day on the spreads , &quot; a KCBT trader said at the midsession . 
KCBT wheat settled 1-1 / 2 to 4-1 / 2 cents per bushel lower , with July down 3-1 / 4 cents at $ 3.60-1 / 4 . 
September was down 4-1 / 2 cents at $ 3.63 . 
Rosenthal Collins was a featured player , bull-spreading two million July / Sept bushels at three cents . 
E. D. &amp; F. Man International bull-spread 1.5 million July / Sept at three cents .
