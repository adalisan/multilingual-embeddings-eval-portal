Hong Kong &apos;s leader Tung Chee-hwa has set May 24 as initial date for the first parliamentary elections under Chinese rule , a Hong Kong newspaper said on Saturday . 
the Hong Kong Economic Times quoted sources as saying details of the election rules would be decided by Tung and his inner cabinet on Tuesday . 
it was the first time a specific date had been mentioned for polls to return the first Legislative Council since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule at midnight on Monday . 
Tung told Australian Foreign Minister Alexander downer , who was in Hong Kong for the handover ceremony , last Sunday his administration would hold elections next May . 
China disbanded an elected legislature when it took over the territory on July 1 and replaced it with an unelected interim assembly , chosen by a 400-strong China-controlled committee . 
Tung &apos;s office was not immediately available for comment . 
Western leaders and local pro-democracy campaigners have been pressing for early elections in China &apos;s new Special Administrative Region , promised autonomy with its capitalist lifestyle intact for 50 years .
