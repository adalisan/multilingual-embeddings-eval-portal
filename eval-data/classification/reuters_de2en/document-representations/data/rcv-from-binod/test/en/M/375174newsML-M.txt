Polish zloty slightly weakened against the basket of currencies in slow trade on Thursday after a light currency buying trend based on small importer orders not connected with fuel trade , dealers said . 
they said this trend was also supported by a light dollar rebound against the mark on world markets without much market reaction to Thursday &apos;s finance ministry decision to free fuell prices and profit margins on oil trading . 
&quot; The zloty rate was virtually stable and there were no large orders from oil importers , &quot; said Anna Krzyspiak from Bank Handlowy SA . 
the zloty closed at 2.94 / 2.92 percent from the trading band centre , weaker than Wednesday &apos;s 3.31 / 3.19 percent . 
it closed at 3.0320 / 27 to the dollar , down from 3.0212 / 52 on Wednesday and at 1.8022 / 24 to the mark , down from 1.7900 / 20 . 
the finance ministry announced it was freeing prices of fuels and removing all administrative limits on profit margins applied to engine fuel trade in leaded and unleaded petrol as well as diesel fuel , as of February 13 . 
dealers said the forex market &apos;s reaction to the freed fuel prices would likely be limited in short term as refineries had contracts signed several months in advance . 
&quot; Large ( Polish ) oil importers usually have contracts booked at least one month in advance , so the effect on the forex market should be minimal , &quot; Handlowy &apos;s Skiba said . 
the largest Polish refineries have already said that they planned to increase fuel prices some seven percent on average . 
the money market remained short with one-day rates above 23 percent despite nearly two weeks of no central bank draining operations as banks were wary of increased cash outflows due a rise in mandatory reserves on February 28 . 
overnight rates were at 23.15 / 23.35 percent , up from opening &apos;s 23.10 / 23.30 percent , tomorrow / next rates were at 23.20 / 23.45 percent , up from 23.20 / 23.50 percent at 0900 GMT .
