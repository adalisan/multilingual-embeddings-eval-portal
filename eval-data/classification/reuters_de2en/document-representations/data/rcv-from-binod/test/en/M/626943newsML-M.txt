U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Monday were seen steady to $ 0.50 per cwt lower , pressured by light packer demnad amid continued poor operating margins , livestock dealers said . 
overcapacity , tight hog supplies and soft pork demand have kept operating margins in the red since late April , with many hog plants working reduced hours for nearly six weeks in efforts to mend the operations . 
demand will be reduced further when the second shift is suspended next week at John Morrell &apos;s hog plant in Sioux Falls , S.D. 
the reduction was announced Wednesday . 
despite increased hog supplies this week , which pushed cash hog prices lower , margins were unable to recover because pork prices also fell , market sources said . 
Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top prices for hogs at the plant were seen $ 55.50 to $ 56.00 . 
the top Iowa / southern Minnesota price for hogs delivered to the plant on Friday was $ 56.00 , down $ 1.00 from Thursday , but down $ 3.00 from a week ago , USDA statistics showed . 
Illinois top plant price on Monday was seen at $ 55.00 and Indiana / Ohio was projected at $ 56.00 .
