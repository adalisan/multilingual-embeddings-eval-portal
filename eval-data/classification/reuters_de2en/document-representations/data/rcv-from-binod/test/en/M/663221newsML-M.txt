the Czech National Bank ( CNB ) fixed the crown on Monday at 32.461 to the dollar after Friday &apos;s fixing at 32.322 , and at 18.730 to the mark from 18.690 . 
the rates correspond roughly with the levels on the interbank market when the central bank calculates its daily fixing . 
on May 27 , the central bank eliminated its fluctuation band within which it would fix the crown up to plus / minus 7.5 percent of a mark / dollar basket , and now uses the fixing only as a daily reference point reflecting the market . 
the fluctuation band was dropped after the central bank was forced to intervene on numerous occassions in recent weeks to defend the crown which had been under heavy downward pressure .
