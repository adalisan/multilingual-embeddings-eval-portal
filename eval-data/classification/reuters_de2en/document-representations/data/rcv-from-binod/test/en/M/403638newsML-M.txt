the Zimbabwe dollar closed weaker against hard currencies on Wednesday , but dealers said it recovered from morning lows after some banks started off-loading money they had been hoarding as a self-protective measure . 
&quot; The market was rather long today . 
there was a bit of early buying but we started seeing some sellers towards the end , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; There was only one medium-sized payment that went through . 
we saw a couple of small inflows coming in , &quot; he added . 
dealers however said the dollar was likely to maintain its depreciatory trend if rumours of a big payment coming up proved true . 
&quot; We should see the dollar going up and down in the coming days , &quot; one said . 
the local unit finished the day at 11.1750 / 1850 against the U.S. dollar , up from a low of 11.1900 / 2000 in the morning but weaker compared to late Tuesday &apos;s 11.1725 / 1825 . 
it was at 18.2900 / 3620 from 18.2760 / 3035 versus sterling and dropped to 6.6770 / 6890 from 6.6675 / 6765 against the mark . 
against the rand however it edged up to 2.5205 / 5330 from 2.5280 / 5330 .
