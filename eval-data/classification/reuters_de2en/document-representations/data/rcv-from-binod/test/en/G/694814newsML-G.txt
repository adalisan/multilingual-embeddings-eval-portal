Albanians flocked to polling stations on Sunday in a general election aimed at ending months of turmoil and both President Sali Berisha &apos;s Democratic Party and its Socialist rivals immediately said they had done well . 
sporadic clashes across the Balkan state claimed at least one life . 
but voting proceeded without the widespread violence which gripped the country for months and killed 1,500 people . 
both Berisha , out to retain his Democratic Party &apos;s stranglehold on parliament , and Socialist leader Fatos Nano , who blames the president for the violence , pledged to respect the outcome . 
Genc Pollo , the Democrats &apos; secretary general , said exit polls conducted by his party put it ahead by nearly two to one in the port of Durres and gave it a smaller lead in the central city of Elbasan . 
&quot; The lead is clear , &quot; he told reporters . 
Socialist spokesman Kastriot Islami said its calculations showed the party and its leftist allies had won two-thirds of the popular vote and 11 of 15 seats in the capital Tirana . 
in some southern areas , focal point of months of unrest directed against Berisha , he said the Socialists had won up to 85 percent of the vote . 
early returns from the southern city of Gjirokaster gave the party an easy victory in two districts . 
in the Adriatic port of Sarande , incomplete results put the Socialists ahead with 60 percent . 
Party supporters responded by firing into the air . 
the Democrats lay fourth with five percent . 
officials said turnout had been a healthy 65 percent an hour before voting ended . 
polls closed at 6 p.m. ( 1600 GMT ) , three hours earlier than originally planned , to ensure safety for voters and some 500 international observers ahead of counting . 
a 7,000-strong International Protection Force sent to Albania in April helped to guard polling stations . 
more than 1,000 candidates from 27 parties stood for the 155 parliamentary seats -- 115 to be decided in two-round majority races and the rest by a proportional system . 
the Democrats held 122 of the 140 seats in the outgoing parliament . 
a second round will be held next Sunday between the the two top candidates in districts where no one won 50 percent of the vote in the first round . 
the chief electoral officer in a village near the southern town of Fier was shot dead on Sunday and a policeman was injured in the melee , an Interior Ministry spokesman said . 
&quot; The crime was politically motivated , &quot; the spokesman said by telephone . 
he said the victim was a member of Berisha &apos;s Democrats and the chief suspect had links to the Socialists . 
Berisha , president since 1992 , said after voting in a polling station in a Tirana school classroom that he would abide by the outcome of the vote . 
but he was coy about whether he would stay in office if the Socialists scored a big victory . 
it was too early , he said , to consider &quot; cohabitation &quot; in Albania . 
Nano said the election was the first step of Albania &apos;s integration into Europe , seven years after the collapse of one of eastern Europe &apos;s most repressive communist regimes . 
&quot; These elections are of extraordinary importance , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This will be a society of free citizens no different from other European nations . 
tomorrow will be a new day . 
Catherine Lalumiere , top official for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe overseeing the vote , said she was pleased with what she saw at Tirana polling stations . 
she spent the afternoon touring other regions by helicopter . 
the OSCE has said it is unrealistic for normal Western standards to be attained in Albania &apos;s election . 
both main parties complained of irregularities , mostly voters left off lists . 
there were also incidents of ballot papers or boxes being stolen or tampered with at gunpoint . 
in MAT district , central Albania , no voting took place as ballot papers had not been delivered . 
the OSCE had to reprint papers for 10 districts 48 hours before the vote after election officials complained of errors . 
Berisha , initially lionised by the West for promoting free market policies , has been criticised for increasingly authoritarian rule . 
many Albanians blame him for the collapse of the investment schemes which left thousands destitute in Europe &apos;s poorest country . 
the election campaign was conducted under a state of emergency imposed on March 2 to try to quell the unrest .
