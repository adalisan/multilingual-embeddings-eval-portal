the Brazilian economy is showing signs of picking up and the government does not plan to take measures to restrict growth , Finance Minister Pedro Malan said . 
in an interview with newspaper Jornal do Brasil , Malan said it was &quot; reasonable &quot; to expect economic growth of between four and 4.5 percent in 1997 . 
numbers from the government &apos;s National Statistics Institute ( IBGE ) showed growth of 2.4 percent in the 12 months to September 30 while growth in the third quarter would be around 3.6 percent and about 3.1 percent for 1996 as a whole , he said . 
the IBGE also saw 7.2 percent growth in the third quarter of 1996 compared with the same period in 1995 , Malan said . 
&quot; Whoever looks at these numbers will see we are clearly in a recovery phase , &quot; the minister told Jornal do Brasil . 
&quot; There is no reason to talk about recession because we didn &apos;t have one , we don &apos;t have one and we won &apos;t have one . 
&quot; There is also no reason to talk about an excessive rate of growth that has to be immediately fought with restrictive measures , &quot; Malan continued .
