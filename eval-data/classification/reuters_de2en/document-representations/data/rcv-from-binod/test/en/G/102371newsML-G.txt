at night when the party starts and teenagers drink home-made liquor out of plastic bags , the streets of Rene Polanco Barrio belong to the Corpse-eaters , one of Managua burgeoning number of youth gangs . 
Rene Polanco is one link in the &quot; misery belt &quot; surrounding the Nicaraguan capital , where soaring gang violence has made people in this once-sleepy city afraid to walk alone at night . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing to do here anymore -- no jobs , no money . 
there &apos;s nothing to do but fight and drink , &quot; said Manuel , 16 , whose thin arms were covered with gang tattoos , his head with a dirty T-shirt . 
he said the Corpse-eaters got their macabre name because their home turf is near a cemetery and people said they dug up the dead to rob them -- a charge he denied . 
Managua Police Chief Pedro Aguilar said the Corpse-eaters are one of Managua &apos;s most dangerous gangs ; their members carry guns , brawl with rival gangs and have been known to confront police . 
now the word is out -- like the capital cities of its violent neighbours , the streets of Managua are no longer safe . 
Nicaragua &apos;s crime rate has soared by 11.4 percent in 1996 over 1995 and the number of crimes committed in Managua has doubled since 1989 , according to police statistics . 
a crime is committed every 10 seconds in Nicaragua , population 4.2 million , and as in other Latin American capitals private security is a booming business . 
one of the main reasons for the growing crime rate is a boom in youth-gang activity , Aguilar said . 
&quot; They &apos;ve increased at a frightening rate . 
one year ago there were 12 such groups , now we have 66 groups on record , &quot; he said . 
groups such as the Salineros , the Corpse-eaters , the Medicine Men , the Russians , the Gandys , the skinheads and the Minibrakers have graduated from petty theft to murder , armed robbery , rape , extortion and drug use , he said . 
Aguilar said they still are not gangs in the traditional sense since they lack an organised structure and are made up loosely knit groups of between eight and 35 teenagers but they represent a &quot; real danger to Managuans . 
&quot; Their level of dangerousness has increased . 
almost all the groups engage in armed robbery , sexual assault , murder , drug consumption and disturbing the peace , &quot; Aguilar said . 
Managuans grew accustomed to political violence after a bloody eight-year civil war between U.S.-backed contra rebels and the left-wing Sandinista government in the 1980s left at least 30,000 dead . 
but until recently Nicaragua had been spared the common crime and gang violence that plagued other Latin American capitals , Aguilar said . 
the civil war , military conscription and Sandinista Party control of the barrios kept young people off the streets and the city relatively gang-free , he said . 
but in the 1990s , the civil war ended and military conscription was abolished , creating a tinderbox of idle young people waiting to explode . 
thousands of youths trained for war returned to their homes only to find unemployment and poverty , Aguilar said . 
according to government statistics , 55 percent of Nicaraguans between the ages of 14 and 24 do not work or go to school . 
Aguilar said they began to notice the surge in youth gangs in 1992 and they have continued growing ever since . 
another factor is the return of deported gang members from the United States , a problem that has also haunted El Salvador , he said . 
&quot; The influence of outside gangs has reached Nicaragua through the Los Angeles-El Salvador route , &quot; Aguilar said . 
without a job or an education , Manuel &apos;s prospects are as limited as his desires . 
asked what he dreamed of for his future , he responded : &quot; That someone with money helps me out .
