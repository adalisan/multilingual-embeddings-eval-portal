inflation in Latvia is likely to be between 10 to 12 percent in 1997 , down from 16 percent this year , Finance Minister Aivar Kreituss said on Wednesday . 
Kreituss said these figures were in the 1997 budget and were in line with International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) recommendations . 
the budget , approved by the cabinet on Tuesday , was drawn up without a deficit . 
this compares with a 1995 deficit of 90 million lats and 1996 &apos;s planned 40 million lats shortfall . 
&quot; This year , inflation will be 16 percent . 
next year , as agreed with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , it will be 10 to 12 percent , &quot; Kreituss told a news conference . 
after Tuesday &apos;s cabinet approval , the draft budget will be sent to parliament for consideration . 
&quot; On Monday , all members of parliament will receive the budget , and they can start work on it , &quot; Kreituss said . 
spending and income were set at 544 million lats in the budget . 
the largest source of income was a sales tax , expected to bring in 290 million lats . 
excise tax will bring some 82.4 million lats , company income tax 59.4 million and customs duties 16.3 million lats . 
Kreituss said the 1997 budget included 22 million lats from privatisation . 
&quot; It is expected that the privatisation of larger companies will give the first visible results to the Latvian economy , &quot; Kreituss said . 
Latvia &apos;s privatisation has received a boost under Prime Minister Andris Shkele . 
a stake has already been sold in the Latvian Gas company and shares are being offered in energy supplier Latvenergo . 
preparations are also under way to sell a stake in the Latvian Shipping Company , one of the country &apos;s biggest firms . 
Kreituss said a cut in the sales tax from 18 percent to 15 or 12 percent will be considered if tax collection stays solid .
