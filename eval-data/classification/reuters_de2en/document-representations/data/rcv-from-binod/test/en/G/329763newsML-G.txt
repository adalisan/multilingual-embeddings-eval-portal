Brive coach Laurent Seigne has demanded an &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; performance from his team when they face up to Leicester in the European Cup final at Cardiff Arms Park on Saturday . 
the tournament climax is being beamed to 86 countries and organisers have forecast a potential worldwide television audience of 35 million , but Seigne &apos;s priorities are firmly focused on matching Leicester &apos;s forwards rather than producing any champagne rugby . 
&quot; I want the team to behave like Anglo-Saxons , namely to be very disciplined and strong in order to control the game . 
French confidence was undoubtedly undermined by Leicester &apos;s 37-11 semifinal eclipse of holders Toulouse , who beat Brive in last year &apos;s French championship final , although Seigne is not convinced the result was quite as significant as it appears . 
&quot; Of course we watched Leicester &apos;s semifinal against Toulouse . 
the English were very efficent but the Toulouse they beat was not the one who won the Cup last year . 
&quot; We are in a completely different frame of mind . 
usually we &apos;re at our best on the big occasions . 
Seigne insists fly-half Alain Penaud will play despite a calf injury against Ireland , but two of the most influential men in the respective sides &apos; build-up are not on the team sheet . 
Leicester &apos;s forward-orientated game has taken on a new dimension since the arrival of ex-Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer at the start of the season , while Brive has benefitted from the assistance of his former captain Nick Farr-Jones , currently based in France and acting as an advisor to Brive . 
&quot; I rang Nick and asked him if , now we were adversaries , this was the end of a beautiful friendship , &quot; said Dwyer . 
&quot; He had a quiet chuckle but , on Saturday , we will be on opposite sides and I guess it will be quite strange . 
Dwyer believes this year &apos;s expanded tournament , which has also featured club sides from Wales , Scotland , Ireland and Italy and produced an average of 5.89 tries per match so far , is a worthy counterpart to its southern hemisphere equivalent . 
&quot; I see this as only slightly below the level of the Super 12 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The top clubs could and would compete in the lower levels of the Super 12 . 
Dwyer is concerned , though , that the two finalists may cancel each other out in a number of areas , not least the back-row where Leicester pit the unshakeable Dean Richards and dashing Neil Back against the dynamic Polish-born flanker Gregori Kacala . 
&quot; Their whole style is too similar to ours for our liking , &quot; said Dwyer . 
&quot; They are not a classical French team but are a very difficult side to play against . 
they bind better and combine better than most other French packs do . 
the second-tier European Conference final , an all-French affair involving Bourgoin and Castres , takes place in Beziers on Sunday .
