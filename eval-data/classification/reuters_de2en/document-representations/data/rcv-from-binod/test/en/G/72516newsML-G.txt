Alexander Korzhakov , the former bodyguard , close friend and confidant of President Boris Yeltsin , said in an interview published on Tuesday he had little doubt who would be the next Kremlin leader . 
&quot; Lebed , &quot; Korzhakov told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper laconically when asked who would eventually succeed Yeltsin , who is awaiting heart surgery . 
his choice of Alexander Lebed , the outspoken general who finished a strong third in Russia &apos;s presidential election this year before Yeltsin appointed him his security supremo , deepened speculation that the two men could form an alliance . 
Russian media have already suggested the political interests of Lebed , who was appointed Yeltsin &apos;s national security adviser on June 18 , and Korzhakov , who was ousted 48 hours later in a purge of Kremlin hawks , could be close . 
Itogi , a current affairs programme on the commercial NTV television , said on Sunday that Lebed , a stranger in the well entrenched Kremlin team , saw Korzhakov as a potential ally . 
Lebed needed Korzhakov &apos;s experience in the Kremlin to help him , Itogi said . 
in turn , Korzhakov could use Lebed &apos;s support to launch his own political career . 
he plans to contest the next parliamentary seat that becomes available in a by-election . 
Lebed has not concealed his presidential ambitions , although Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Tuesday there was no question of Yeltsin stepping down at present . 
Korzhakov , originally Yeltsin &apos;s KGB bodyguard in the mid-1980s , is a family friend who stayed faithful to Yeltsin for more than 10 years and was rewarded with promotion to the rank of general . 
his presidential security service grew from a handful of officers into a huge corps or thousands of men with sophisticated military equipment . 
he hinted darkly in the interview about the knowledge he had accumulated in his years at Yeltsin &apos;s side . 
&quot; I really know a lot about them , about their behind-the- scene lives , &quot; he said about his political opponents including Krmelin Chief-of-Staff Anatoly Chubais . 
&quot; I am waiting for the appropriate time ( to release this information . 
Russian and foreign media have carried many reports about Korzhakov &apos;s once huge influence in the Kremlin . 
some said that most of the Kremlin offices were bugged by his service . 
Korzhakov and two of his political allies were sacked by Yeltsin after a bitter clash between the liberal and hardline wings of the Yeltsin camp between rounds one and two of the presidential election . 
Korzhakov &apos;s agents arrested two Yeltsin campaign aides linked to Chubais , a liberal economist and former privatisation minister , but the pair were released within hours . 
Korzhakov &apos;s dismissal was described by Yeltsin &apos;s wife Naina as like an amputation because of his legendary closeness to the president . 
at the time , some experts considered that Lebed had a hand in their sackings . 
Korzhakov disappeared from public view after his sacking but emerged recently to try to gain a bigger profile . 
he flew to the far eastern Primorsky region to express his support for a controversial local governor who has been at odds with Chubais for years . 
last week , he met pop star Michael Jackson and presented him with an antique sword but the event ended in disarray when customs refused to let the sword out of the country , saying special permission was needed . 
Korzhakov made clear that he saw Chubais -- whom he repeatedly calls &quot; the regent &quot; -- and Yeltsin &apos;s daughter Tatyana , both of whom played key roles in the election campaign , as the people who were behind his sacking . 
and the bitterness of his feelings was clear when , asked whether he missed Yeltsin and met him after his departure from the Kremlin , Korzhakov said : 
we live in the same house , on the same floor . 
but it is another matter that I have no desire yet .
