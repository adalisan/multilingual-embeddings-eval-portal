Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke said on Friday the German central bank had already signalled that it thought the &apos; correction &apos; of the dollar against the mark was complete at a rate of 1.70 marks . 
the mark is currently significantly weaker than this level , trading at around 1.86 marks to the dollar early on Friday . 
speaking on German radio , Welteke said the Bundesbank was watching developments on foreign exchange markets very closely , but said it had no exact date for any intervention in currency markets . 
&quot; I am not making an appraisal of when the dollar exactly reflects fundamental economic data , but when the dollar was at 1.70 marks we said the correction was over and that the dollar was in an area that ( we ) would like to see . 
Welteke acknowledged there was a danger of imported inflation in Germany but that &quot; it is not appropriate to turn the interest rate screw &quot; because of slow economic growth and high unemployment . 
&quot; As long as we see no clear sign of climbing inflation we should not change interest rates , &quot; he said . 
Welteke added that the Bundesbank did not have currency market level oriented policies , but rather money supply oriented policies . 
Welteke said the impact of currency market levels on the cost of living index was small , saying that independent economists believed the share of consumer imports denominated in dollars was relatively low . 
Welteke said there were many reasons for the mark &apos;s decline , but that one of the most important was a lack of trust in European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) and in German politicians . 
&quot; Above all , there is an obvious lack of confidence in politics and developments in the euro . 
we should make clear that here in Germany , not only money supply policy , but also fiscal and tax policies will be practised in such a way as to ensure that the euro will be stable and that trust will strengthen , &quot; he said .
