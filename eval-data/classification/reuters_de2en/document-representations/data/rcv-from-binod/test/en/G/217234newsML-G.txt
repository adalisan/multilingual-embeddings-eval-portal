Cambodian co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said on Tuesday he was optimistic that Briton Christopher Howes was on his way to freedom after months as a captive of Khmer Rouge guerrillas . 
the prince said he would be going to the northwest province of Siem Reap on Wednesday to follow developments more closely , a move welcomed by the British Embassy . 
but an embassy spokesman reiterated there was still no confirmation of a claim last week by a senior Cambodian military official that Howes and his interpreter Houn Hourth , abducted by armed men in Siem Reap province on March 26 , had escaped . 
when asked if the government had new information on the whereabouts of Howes and Houn Hourth , Ranariddh told Reuters : &quot; Not yet , but very optimistic . 
the prince later told reporters : &quot; We are still very optimistic about the issue . 
we are sure that the hostage and his escort left ( the Khmer Rouge hardliners &apos; base of ) Anlong Veng several days ( ago ) . 
&quot; I think he left already alive and is on the way ( to government positions ) ... It will not be long now , &quot; said Ranariddh , adding that he expected the issue to be resolved in days . 
Howes and Houn Hourth were abducted by armed men on March 26 while conducting mine-clearing work for the Mines Advisory Group ( MAG ) of Britain . 
the British government remained cautious . 
an embassy spokesman said : &quot; We welcome the first prime minister &apos;s intention to visit Siem Reap . 
it &apos;s our understanding that he &apos;s going to investigate the situation . 
&quot; But on Howes there &apos;s no new information , &quot; he added . 
the embassy and MAG have stressed that reports saying the two men have escaped are premature , but that they remain hopeful of good news . 
last week , armed forces deputy chief of staff Lieutenant General Nhiek Bun Chhay said the two had escaped from the Anlong Veng base of hardliners loyal to Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot with the help of their guards and other guerrillas who wanted to defect . 
he said the hostages had reached the jungle village of Anlong Kranh , some 185 kilometres ( 115 miles ) north of Phnom Penh . 
but officials said the two men had yet to surface . 
Nhiek Bun Chhay declined to give further details on the situation on Tuesday , saying only that Howes had &quot; not yet &quot; arrived in government hands . 
Secretary of State for the Interior Ministry Ho Sok told Reuters : &quot; There are some obstacles that we cannot discuss . 
the ranks of the Khmer Rouge , which ruled Cambodia in a 1975-1979 reign of terror , have been decimated since August by mass defections . 
the Maoist movement reneged on a 1991 peace pact and had been fighting the coalition government following U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 .
