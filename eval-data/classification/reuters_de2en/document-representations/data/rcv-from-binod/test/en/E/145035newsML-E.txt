Malaysia &apos;s producer price index ( PPI ) is forecast to rise by 2.0 percent in 1997 versus an estimated 2.5 percent gain in 1996 , the Ministry of Finance said on Friday in its 1996 / 97 economic report . 
during the first eight months of 1996 , the PPI for the domestic economy rose 1.5 percent versus 4.4 percent in the corresponding 1995 period , the ministry said in its annual report on the economy . 
the slower growth is mainly attributable to a fall in prices of agricultural products , particularly rubber and palm oil , it said .
