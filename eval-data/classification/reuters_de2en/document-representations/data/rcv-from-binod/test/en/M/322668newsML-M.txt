shares on Cyprus &apos;s stock exchange hit an all time low of 78.36 on Tuesday , plunging 1.45 percent in a single day amid investor concern about the unstable political climate on the island , analysts said . 
the 41-share Cyprus Stock Exchange ( CSE ) all-share index , set at 100 points , has been registering declines since the begining of the year . 
Tuesday &apos;s close is the lowest level the market has reached since the official opening of the CSE in March 1996 . 
declines were recorded in all seven sub indices . 
&quot; There is a gloomy perception among the public at large about the prospects of the economy , &quot; said Haris Christoforou , an economist and Finance editor of the English-language Cyprus Mail daily . 
&quot; People do not want to invest their money in equity , in immovable assets or even borrow money out of the bank , &quot; he said . 
Christoforou said the gloomy outlook was prompted in part by the unstable political climate and fears it could have a repercussion on tourism , which represents 21 percent of the island &apos;s gross domestic product . 
&quot; Whether or not it is justified there is a phobia so people prefer to keep the money in their pocket , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Stavros Agrotis from Cisco stockbrokers agreed that the political climate had affected investor &apos;s sentiment . 
&quot; The market is fundamentally affected by the political situation , &quot; he said . 
he said one reason for Tuesday &apos;s sharp decline was because of need for extra cash to cover Monday &apos;s heavy buying . 
&quot; Some people bought yesterday and sold today , &quot; he said . 
the decline gained momentum earlier in the month when tension peaked between Cyprus and Turkey over the island &apos;s plans to deploy anti-aircraft missiles and Turkish threats they would destroy them . 
banking stocks lost 1.27 percent of their value to close at 88.37 . 
insurance companies fell 1.42 percent to 56.10 . 
trading companies fell 2.33 percent to close at 55.33 . 
industrial companies closed at 76.97 , losing two percent of their value .
