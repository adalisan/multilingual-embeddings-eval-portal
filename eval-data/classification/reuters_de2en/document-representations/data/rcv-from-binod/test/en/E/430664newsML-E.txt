Germany &apos;s powerful central bank faces no immediate need to adjust key interest rates , but remains sufficiently flexible to react quickly if conditions changed , a senior Bundesbank official said on Monday . 
pointing to Germany &apos;s record-high jobless rate as well as low and stable inflation rates , Bundesbank council Ernst Welteke said he saw no signs demanding an immediate shift in interest rate policies . 
&quot; There are no near term dangers for the currently advantageous German price climate , &quot; Welteke told foreign journalists . 
he added &quot; Cast against this background I see no imminent cause to change interest rates . 
Welteke , also president of the state central bank in Hesse , however stressed his comments were not a prognosis as the policy-making council discusses the issue anew every 14 days . 
considering Germany &apos;s 4.7 million jobless , the highest levels seen since Adolf Hitler came to power , Welteke said it would be rather curious if the Bundesbank were to raise interest rates from their historically low levels now . 
in fact Welteke noted that the Bundesbank has in the past managed to keep interest rates at low levels for a considerable amount of time during the early stages of an economic recovery . 
although unions have demanded the Bundesbank cut interest rates again to help jump-start economic growth and fuel job growth , independent economists said rates cuts were no longer on the Bundesbank agenda , saying instead the probability is greater that rates would be raised , possibly before year-end . 
the Bundesbank last cut interest rates in April 1996 , moving the discount rate to 2.50 percent and the Lombard rate to 4.50 percent . 
the money market rate has been held steady at three percent since August , 1996 . 
however Welteke quickly noted that while inflationary pressures were currently not a problem , the Bundesbank , famous for its inflation-battling policies , remained vigilant , ready to act to stem revived price pressures . 
Welteke rejected suggestions the Bundesbank might face a dilemma in taking appropriate action on interest rates at a time Germany races to meet the deficit criteria to enter Europe &apos;s monetary union . 
insisting the Bundesbank remained &quot; flexible &quot; to react , Welteke said &quot; It is not without appropriate cause that we stress that if the dollar &apos;s rise continued at its current levels , we would soon see imported inflationary pressures .
