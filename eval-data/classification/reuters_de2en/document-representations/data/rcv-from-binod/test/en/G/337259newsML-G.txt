the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , which sent dozens of observers to presidential elections in breakaway Chechnya , gave its seal of approval to the polls on Tuesday . 
&quot; Based on all available information OSCE ... states that the elections reflect the free will of those entitled to vote and form a legitimate base for the new authorities , &quot; Tim Guldimann , OSCE mission chief in Chechnya , told a news conference in the regional capital . 
Guldimann said 72 OSCE observers had registered only minor procedural problems during the voting on Monday , such as campaigning continuing right up to polling day . 
&quot; There were no serious infringements with effect on the overall results and in particular there were no indications of distortions , &quot; he said . 
&quot; At least one OSCE observer who had monitored dozens of elections said that the Chechen elections were among the best he had seen . 
no official results from the presidential polls , held simultaneously with the regional parliament election , have been announced . 
but Aslan Maskhadov , rebel military chief seen as the election favourite , claimed a clear win earlier on Tuesday . 
electoral Commission chairman Mumadi Saydaiyev , who also attended Guldimann &apos;s news conference , said it was too early to make final conclusions . 
&quot; There will be a second round of the parliamentary polls , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In theory I do not rule out that it could happen in the presidential election as well . 
a successful candidate has to get more than 50 percent of votes in the first round to win outright . 
Saydaiyev said his commission was annoyed by a series of unauthorised leaks of early returns and decided not to issue any information before the count was finally completed . 
he said this could happen on Wednesday . 
the polls became possible after Russian and Chechen separatist rebels signed a peace deal on August 31 under which Russia withdrew its troops and rebels agreed to postpone the final decision on the region &apos;s future political status . 
but all major candidates made clear during the poll that they wanted full independence for Chechnya , something Moscow rejects outright . 
President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s press secretary said the Kremlin leader had cautiously welcomed Maskhadov &apos;s apparent win and hoped that this would help further peace talks . 
but he reiterated Moscow opposition to Chechnya &apos;s independence . 
Maskhadov , who had signed the August peace deal for Chechnya , told a news conference in Grozny that he was firm in his demand for full independence and was ready to start talks with Moscow to achieve it .
