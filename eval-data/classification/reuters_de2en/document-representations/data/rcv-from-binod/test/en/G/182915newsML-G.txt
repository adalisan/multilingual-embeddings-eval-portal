the Vatican chose a design by a 22-year-old Italian art student over those submitted by advertising agencies to be the logo for the Roman Catholic Church &apos;s celebrations for the year 2000 . 
the woman , Emanuela Rocchi , submitted a logo made of five doves embracing each other in a circle to form a globe surrounded by the Latin words &quot; Christ : yesterday , Today and Forever , &quot; and &quot; Jubilee , A.D. 2000 &quot; . 
&quot; Maybe the Pope wanted to show his support of young people , &quot; she told a news conference at the Vatican where the logo was presented . 
Vatican officials did not say how many people and which advertising agencies had entered the competition . 
Rocchi lives in a small town in Italy &apos;s central Umbrian region and attends a design school . 
she created the red , orange , blue , green and grey logo on a computer . 
on November 30 the Pope is to open three years of celebrations leading to the start of the third Christian millennium in the year 2000 .
