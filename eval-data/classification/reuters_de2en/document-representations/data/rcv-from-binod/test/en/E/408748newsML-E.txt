France &apos;s gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter , putting the country &apos;s depressed economy on a sounder base for an expected recovery this year . 
the government said full-year growth was 1.3 percent , in line with its official forecast , after growth of 2.2 percent in 1995 . 
the rise was slightly higher than economists &apos; expectations but they said it was partly offset by a small downward revision to third quarter GDP growth , which was revised to 0.8 percent from an initially reported 0.9 percent . 
a Finance Ministry official said the rise was in line with government expectations and made it more likely the country would reach its official 1997 growth target of 2.3 percent . 
&quot; It reinforces our position , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s a nice surprise , &quot; Herve Goulletquer , an economist with Banques populaires , said . 
&quot; All the conditions are present for stronger growth in 1997 . 
the government needs stronger growth this year to fulfil its plans to reduce the public deficit in preparation for European monetary union . 
the Finance Ministry official said growth would have been much stronger at the end of last year if the effect of the number of working days and a sharp drop in car sales were stripped out . 
car sales were hit by the end of a government purchase-incentive programme that expired at the end of September . 
economists said they expected growth in 1997 to be driven in large part by exports and inventory building , a shift from 1996 , which drew much of its strength from consumer spending . 
consumer spending rose an annual average of 2.3 percent in 1996 and contributed 1.4 percentage points to full-year growth .
