Mexico &apos;s first half government surplus has surged 463 percent to 29 billion pesos compared with the first half of last year , Reforma daily said on Tuesday without citing its source . 
the figure compares with a government surplus in the year-ago period of 4.2 billion pesos , the paper said . 
Reforma said the giant surplus was partly due to a 14.5 percent increase in income , which climbed to 243 billion pesos , while expenses rose just 3.3 percent in the first half to 214 billion pesos . 
in the first six months of 1996 , the government earned 172.1 billion pesos and spent 167.9 billion , Reforma said . 
Mexico &apos;s Deputy Finance Minister Martin Werner told Reuters recently that the government would register a fiscal deficit in the second half of the year and would launch more longer-term debt on the domestic market to finance the expected deficit . 
the Finance Ministry has estimated a deficit of about 0.5 percent of GDP in 1997 .
