+ Brent is expected to open slightly higher although the trend is still bearish , under the weight of gaps on the June contract chart and the continuation chart at $ 18.62 / $ 18.77 and $ 18.40 / $ 18.50 respectively . 
+ A number of minor support levels at around $ 17.50 are likely to prove hard to break through . 
IPE Brent crude oil futures are labouring under the weight of overhead chart gaps and traders and technical analysts said the market looks bearish for the next few sessions . 
June Brent closed 23 cents up on Friday at $ 17.92 a barrel , while May gas oil was a dollar higher at $ 163.25 . 
Peter Sceats at CharTech-MCS said in a weekly report that an overhead chart gap on the June contract was a bearish sign . 
&quot; The prominent short term pattern on ( the June chart ) is the $ 18.77 / $ 18.62 gap down , &quot; he said . 
&quot; While the gap is open the pattern can be seen as a sign of inherent weakness . 
this focus for bears will also be the rock under which protective buy stops are hidden . 
he also pointed to a similar chart gap on the continuation chart at $ 18.50 / $ 18.40 . 
in addition , the market was sitting under a three and a half month downtrend line which crosses the price action at $ 18.67 on Monday , $ 18.63 on Tuesday . 
&quot; Basically Brent needs to find within itself the power to settle firstly above $ 18.50 and secondly above the down trend if it is to improve its chances of recovery , &quot; Sceats said . 
he said a breakout from the previous trading range may well be at hand . 
&quot; The outer bands of our chosen Bollinger study have sharply narrowed . 
this is often seen as a &apos; calm before the storm &apos; type indication and ... is often a precursor to a breakout style move . 
but he added : &quot; The study holds no forecasting implication as to which way she might break . 
wee Woon Whae at mms in Singapore said she saw $ 17.50 as the next support level for June Brent , although the market was unlikely to reach as low as that on Monday . 
&quot; The trend is still down , &quot; she said . 
&quot; That $ 17.50 level is minor support and is a psychological low , &quot; she said , but added , &quot; At this level the contract is oversold on the daily chart so it is expected to consolidate above this level without testing lower .. &quot; 
this level also lies next to a low point on the continuation chart dating from June 14 at $ 17.48 , as well as a series of lows and highs which the June contract formed last August . 
below this level she pegged support at $ 16.70 . 
gas oil has been trading in a range and the market is expected to find some support at chart lows at around $ 160.00 . 
resistance is located at $ 166.50 .
