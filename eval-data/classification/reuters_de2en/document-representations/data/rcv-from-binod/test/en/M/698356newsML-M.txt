LIFFE robusta coffee futures stepped back from Tuesday &apos;s highs to end the day with pared gains on scale-up trade selling . 
but traders said industry price-fixing at the lows helped values to stay in the plus column . 
activity was muted with a mere 5,048 lots , mainly switches , changing hands . 
September traded within a $ 60 band and ended $ 25 up at $ 1,822 and just above a low at $ 1,800 . 
the contract &apos;s foray into a high of $ 1,860 was aided by a technical rally in New York . 
September took out the immediate 181 cents / lb resistance but fell back after failing to clear the next hurdle at 185 . 
locals , who dominated New York &apos;s trading , liquidated their longs but this was met by industry price-fixing at the lows . 
new York &apos;s selling came amid reports of reduced frost risk in Brazil &apos;s coffee belt this weekend . 
a significant polar air mass might pass the coffee areas from the evening of July 5 which could represent the greatest frost threat seen so far this year , Brazil &apos;s meteorologists Somar said on Monday . 
but in fresh comments on Tuesday , the agency said a larger polar air mass could break into smaller masses , thus reducing the possiblity of a damaging cold this weekend . 
overall volume in London reached a scant 1,309 lots . 
Tuesday is the first tender day for July contract .
