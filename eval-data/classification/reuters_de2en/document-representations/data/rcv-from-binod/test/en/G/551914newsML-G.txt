U.S. television threw its biggest coming out party ever this week when comedian Ellen DeGeneres &apos;s sitcom alter ego , a seemingly asexual bookstore manager named Ellen Morgan , announced &quot; I &apos;m gay . 
it was the moment all America had been told to expect -- with or without bated breath -- for months since the story first broke in TV Guide magazine , raising questions as to whether television was striking a blow for tolerance or engaging in yet another attention-grabbing publicity stunt . 
for gay groups , who threw their own parties around the country on Wednesday night to celebrate , Ellen Morgan &apos;s coming out was a moment of long-awaited boldness -- the first time a central character on a comedy show had been revealed as openly gay . 
DeGeneres &apos;s four-year-old show &quot; Ellen , &quot; which has been struggling to stay on the air , was expected to attract up to 20 million viewers and critics called it , sight unseen , a highlight of the season . 
some of the biggest stars of the small screen put in cameo appearances to give their stamp of approval on the one-hour special , which just happened to coincide with sweeps week -- the ratings of programs &apos; relative popularity on which advertising rates are based . 
they included Laura Dern , who plays the woman Ellen falls for and who has already given interviews saying she is hopelessy hetereosexual , Demi Moore , k.d. 
Winfrey plays Ellen &apos;s therapist and the message is that if it is OK for Oprah , it should be OK for America . 
but many conservative groups are complaining that it is not OK and the show has become yet another battleground in the country &apos;s culture wars -- even though far more sensational things happen in films and in books than on television . 
as Time Magazine noted , one of the season &apos;s bestsellers is a woman &apos;s account of her willing affair with her father and one of the year &apos;s biggest films celebrates a drug-addicted pornographer , holding him up as an icon of free speech . 
Carman Pate , vice president of the 500,000-member concerned Women for America , said her group strongly opposed the show because , &quot; even though it has no violence or partial nudity it has a message that can strongly impact a child for life . 
it glorifies a lifestyle that is dangerous . 
this is not a civil rights issue . 
homosexuality can be changed . 
but peg Byron , public education director of the Lambda Legal Defence Fund , one of the nation &apos;s oldest gay groups , said all the programme did was narrow the gap between television and the real world -- a world where gay people exist , work and lead normal , productive lives . 
&quot; stereotypes are harmful and &apos; Ellen &apos; undermines America &apos;s denials about lesbianism . 
DeGeneres originally wanted the show to be a surprise and when word leaked out she found herself at first dissembling , pretending that her character was going to reveal that she was &quot; Lebanese &quot; -- not lesbian . 
but in the last few weeks she has beat her character to the punch , announcing in magazine and TV interviews that she , herself , is gay , something she had kept private until now . 
she and her girl friend , actress Anne Heche , have been making public appearances including at last week &apos;s White House correspondents Dinner , where they were photographed with President Bill Clinton . 
Daniel Cerone , the TV Guide reporter who broke the story , says the programme caused a stir with advertisers . 
some , like Chrysler , dropped plans to advertise on it , but others rushed in and are paying ABC premium rates because of the huge ratings the show was expected to receive . 
&quot; &apos; Ellen &apos; was a series on the border . 
its rating are in the middle of the pack but it didn &apos;t have a focus . 
I don &apos;t think having her character come out is an attempt for ratings as much as making the show represent Ellen DeGeneres &apos;s point of view , &quot; Cerone said . 
the real problems for the show are yet to come -- whether it will be renewed for next season and , if it is , how it will deal with its main character &apos;s homosexuality , he added .
