Wilted bouquets , votive candles and silent guards still line the steps of designer Gianni Versace &apos;s oceanfront mansion on South Miami Beach . 
three blocks away , funeral wreaths decorate the doors of the Versace boutique . 
but a powerful sense of relief permeated the mournful aura early on Thursday as word spread that Versace &apos;s suspected killer , Andrew Cunanan , had taken his own life aboard a houseboat docked a few miles ( kilometres ) away . 
&quot; First , there was tension because they wouldn &apos;t confirm it was in fact Cunanan , &quot; said Clinton Wagoner , manager of the News Cafe , where Versace spent the moments just before he was gunned down on July 15 . 
edgy patrons and waiters at the busy all-night cafe debated whether Cunanan was clever enough to elude the intense police checkpoints . 
&quot; There was a sense among a lot of people that he was lurking in the area , that anybody who did what he did would be capable of anything , &quot; Wagoner said . 
finally , at about 5 a.m. ( 0900 GMT ) , word came that the dead man was indeed Cunanan . 
&quot; From then on , it was like , yeah , a sigh of relief that it was over . 
there &apos;s just a sense of relief that no one else will be hurt by this person , &quot; Wagoner said . 
people gathered through the night outside the mansion in a kind of vigil as the siege drama and the long wait for confirmation that the man was Cunanan dragged on . 
by dawn people had drifted away , the streets around Versace &apos;s home empty of the usual crowds . 
the guards who stand on the mansion &apos;s steps declined to speak to reporters . 
fear is gone but grief remains . 
amid the flowers on Versace &apos;s doorstep , the designer &apos;s face shines up from advertisements torn from glossy magazines . 
&quot; We will miss you , G.V. , &quot; someone had scrawled across one of the pages . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think people are going to throw parties , &quot; Wagoner said . 
&quot; There &apos;s still too much sadness to go out and whoop it up .
