activity in the Mediterranean was stifled on Monday as the market waited for the finalising of the July Urals loading programme which was expected tonight , traders said . 
Urals was pegged firm around dated Brent -95 / -90 cents but set for a sharp drop as soon as more precise information emerges on the renewal of Iraqi Kirkuk loadings , traders said . 
on Monday a senior U.N. humanitarian aid official said that Iraq remained a week to 10 days away from submitting a finalised distribution aid plan to start the oil sales process for the renewed &quot; oil-for-food &quot; accord . 
Western diplomats have said they expect oil sales to resume shortly after the Iraqis submit their distribution plan , a time which may come in early to mid-July . 
U.N. Security Council stern warnings to Iraq over the weekend of further sanctions if it does not abide by allowing unfettered U.N. arms inspections , has no linkage to the &quot; oil-for-food &quot; scheme , U.N. officials stressed . 
Iraq sealed a deal with the U.N. last year to permit it to sell $ 2 billion worth of crude oil over a 180-day period , in order to buy food and medicine for civilians suffering from broad sanctions applied after Saddam Hussein &apos;s forces invaded Kuwait in August 1990 . 
&quot; That ( story ) says the market is on a downward slide , &quot; one trader familiar with the Mediterranean market said predicting that Urals will soon be selling for dated Brent - $ 1.50 a barrel . 
Syrian state oil company Sytrol did not come back to its customers on Monday with a second offer for July crude loadings and some regular lifters said they felt there was little , if any , room for negotiations . 
&quot; That &apos;s the way it feels and we can &apos;t really do anything about it , &quot; said one trader who is due to load a cargo in the first decade of July . 
the Syrians have said they want dated Brent -55 cents for July loadings of Syrian Light . 
West African markets continued to be well supported by plentiful Eastern buying which many expected would last at least for another week . 
&quot; The numbers are right to trade against dated Brent and the buying is still there , &quot; one Nigerian equity holder said . 
Eastern buying for July loadings has been seen from Korea , Japan , China , Taiwan and the IOC . 
buying was up for the month to around 900,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) . 
this compared with an average of 500,000 bpd last year . 
one or two cargoes of qua Iboe were heard to have moved to a U.S. refiner on Friday at dated Brent + 35 cents while brass River was heard to have fetched in the high 40 &apos;s over the benchmark crude .
