new York , May 30 - The dollar Friday closed a volatile week higher against the German mark , bolstered by concern about plans for a single European currency , a rebound in Wall Street stocks and comments from a key U.S. financial official . 
a proposal by the German government to revalue the Bundesbank &apos;s currency and gold reserves sparked a fierce debate this week between government and central bank officials . 
the government wants the revaluation in order to free up cash that can be used to slash Germany &apos;s budget deficit and help the nation qualify for the proposed single European currency , or &quot; Euro . 
but the Bundesbank has objected strenuously to the revaluation , saying it infringed on the bank &apos;s independence . 
on Friday , Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said the government &apos;s plans to revalue currency and gold reserves marked a &quot; dramatic conflict &quot; with the central bank that must be played out fully in public . 
&quot; The market recognises that the Bundesbank isn &apos;t going to take this gold revaluation plan lightly , &quot; said Brian McCarthy , a market analyst at Ruesch International . 
&quot; That means we are going to see a barrage of statements from the Bundesbank that will question the viability of the Euro without the right fiscal underpinnings , &quot; McCarthy said . 
&quot; So , when ever the value of the Euro comes under doubt , of course , they sell marks for dollars and sterling ( pounds ) . 
the Dow Jones industrial average had initially tumbled 88 points Friday after Intel Corp. warned it expected revenues in the second quarter to decline 5 percent to 10 percent from the previous quarter . 
yet the Dow erased its early losses to close marginally higher , prompting some traders to rush and buy back dollars , some traders said . 
the dollar soared toward 1.71 marks before retreating . 
in late New York trading Friday , the dollar fetched 1.7061 marks , up from 1.6965 marks Thursday . 
the dollar inched up to 116.28 Japanese yen from 116.18 yen . 
the dollar climbed to 1.4142 Swiss francs from 1.4105 francs , but fell to Canadian $ 1.3783 from C $ 1.3805 . 
the British pound edged up to $ 1.6405 , compared with $ 1.6403 . 
further support for the dollar emerged in comments by William McDonough , president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank . 
in response to a question at the World Forex Conference in Toronto , McDonough said a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States . 
while traders are accustomed to hearing U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin tout the virtues of a strong dollar , McDonough &apos;s remarks caught some by surprise . 
&quot; Generally , you don &apos;t hear the Fed people saying that , &quot; said a foreign exchange analyst and trader at United Gulf Bank of Bahrain in Boston . 
&quot; This is a new person saying it , and that kind of made people sort of sit up and pay attention . 
the final round of French general elections this Sunday has also garnered much attention in the foreign exchange market . 
the French Socialist party and its leftist allies scored an impressive showing in the first round of elections May 25 . 
the outcome of the runoff this weekend will be scrutinised for any impact on plans for the proposed single European currency , or European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) . 
the Socialists favour a less stringent interpretation of the standards that must be met in order to qualify for monetary union . 
&quot; If the Socialists do get in , that could certainly have implications for French monetary policy , for EMU . 
it could throw the whole European thing off-track , presumably , &quot; said Frank Pusateri , vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Mellon Bank in Boston .
