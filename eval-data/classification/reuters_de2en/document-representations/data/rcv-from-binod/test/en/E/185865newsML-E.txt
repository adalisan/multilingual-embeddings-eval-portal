more Poles now believe their economy is moving towards a market system , rather than towards socialism , or is at least half way there , according to a survey by Centrum Badania Opinii Spolecznej ( CBOS ) . 
three years ago , when the public CBOS institute last surveyed them on this subject , they thought differently . 
in a poll conducted in September 1996 , nearly seven years after the fall of communism and Poland &apos;s centrally-planned system , 28 percent said the economy was changing toward a market , up from 18 percent in April 1993 . 
some 25 percent told CBOS the economy was changing toward socialism , less than the 39 percent who held this view three years ago . 
about a third of the 1150 people surveyed between September 12-17 said the economy was in the middle of the road between a market orientation and socialism , up from 25 percent in 1993 , while 14 percent were undecided . 
&quot; In society &apos;s consciousness the dominant view is that we are now crossing or have crossed the &apos; critical point &apos; on the road to a market economy , &quot; CBOS said in an analysis of the poll results .
