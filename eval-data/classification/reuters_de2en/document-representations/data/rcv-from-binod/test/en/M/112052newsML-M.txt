Shanghai copper futures ended mixed in active trading on Friday with investors unsure of the future direction of the market , traders said .

copper opened higher due to overnight gains on the London Metal Exchange but profit-taking pushed prices steadily down with most contracts closing at or near their intra-day lows , traders said . 
&quot; Many investors suffered losses from sharp fluctuations on the LME over the past few days and they were eager to offset their long positions at high levels , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; sharp fluctuations triggered an expectation of a new round of rises or drops , so investors preferred to take an wait-to-see attitude , &quot; he added . 
traders said LME copper was still in the range of $ 1,900 and $ 1,970 despite sharp rises and falls over the past few days , which resulted in uncertain sentiment in Shanghai . 
&quot; Shanghai copper is likely to move in a narrow range of 19,500 and 20,000 until the LME gives a clear direction , &quot; a second trader said . 
aluminium ended mixed . 
October fell 160 to 13,700 , November rose 20 to 13,640 , Dcember and January unchanged at 13,550 and 13,500 .
