soccer &apos;s world governing body FIFA announced on Wednesday that Ulf Kirsten &apos;s agreement to join Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon was invalid , allowing the former German international striker to stay at Bayer Leverkusen . 
Kirsten , 31 , who won 49 caps for East Germany before appearing 17 times for the united German side , had signed a pre-agreement with Sporting . 
however , FIFA &apos;s Status Committee ruled that his contract with Leverkusen had not been cancelled and he was free to continue in the Bundesliga . 
the committee also ruled in favour of English premier league club Aston Villa in their dispute with Turkish side Fenerbahce over Dalian Atkinson . 
Fenerbahce bought the burly English striker for $ 650,000 but have so far paid only $ 250,000 . 
the ruling said the remaining $ 400,000 must be paid within 30 days .
