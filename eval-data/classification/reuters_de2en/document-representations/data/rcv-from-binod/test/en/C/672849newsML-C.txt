- Taiwan &apos;s Central Leasing Co said on Thursday it would team up with U.S. giant McDonnell Douglas to start a US $ 200 million global leasing firm to tackle aircraft shortages in the vast China market . 
&quot; We recently signed a letter of intent with McDonnell Douglas in Paris for the establishment of the joint venture , &quot; Central Leasing vice chairman J.C. Tung told Reuters . 
start-up capital of the proposed venture , Seanho Leasing Co , would be around US $ 200 million , of which Taiwan interests would contribute 80 percent , Tung said . 
&quot; We are seeking local investment partners in order to raise enough funds for the proposed project , &quot; he said . 
potential partners would include Formosa Plastics group , the Koo &apos;s Group , Shin Kong Life Insurance group and Cathay Life Insurance group , he said . 
a formal agreement between Central Leasing and McDonnell Douglas would require further negotiation , Tung said . 
under the plan , the proposed venture initially would acquire some 150 to 200 McDonnell Douglas planes and lease them to fast-growing airlines , targetting mainland Chinese , southeast Asian and other carriers , Tung said . 
Tung dismissed those numbers , saying it was &quot; still too early &quot; to estimate finances and that a more detailed plan was needed . 
Central is Taiwan &apos;s number three leasing company . 
Tung acknowledged that mainland China , Taiwan &apos;s longtime rival , was an attractive target market and an important reason behind his firm &apos;s decision to work with McDonnell Douglas . 
&quot; Given its huge size , the mainland market is definitely worth exploring , &quot; Tung said .
