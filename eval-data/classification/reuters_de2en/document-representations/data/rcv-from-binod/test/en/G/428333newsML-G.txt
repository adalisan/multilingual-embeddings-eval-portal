the European Commission said on Friday the Spanish government had suspended a request to be allowed to grant aid to a plant in Spain belonging to French carmaker Renault . 
&quot; We have received official information from the Spanish authorities saying that they were suspending their aid project &quot; a Commission spokesman said . 
European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Thursday he was blocking the equivalent of 500 million Belgian francs of subsidies from the Spanish government to the plant in protest at Renault &apos;s decision to close a profitable Belgian assembly plant with the loss of 3,100 jobs . 
the shock announcement of the closure on Thursday last week sparked angry reactions from unions and the Belgian and French governments , in particular over the harsh tone of the announcement and Renault &apos;s apparent total disregard of the social consequences . 
the Belgian government is suing Renault over its flouting of Belgian and European rules on informing and consulting staff on key strategic decisions . 
the European Commission disapproved of Renault &apos;s actions , but could do little else .
