time decay , not lingering concern about a further interest rate rise , was the main enemy of a growing number of bulls in the U.S. stock index options market , traders said . 
although the market was generally turning positive after Tuesday &apos;s widely expected quarter-point interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve , the upcoming Easter weekend pressured implied volatilities , dampening gains in calls . 
&quot; implied volatility is very high , which makes it very dangerous to buy options , &quot; said Larry McMillan of McMillan Analysis Corp. 
but he added that he had just issued a buy recommendation for S &amp; P100 index calls on the assumption that gains in the index would probably outpace a near-term softening in volatilities . 
the Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) volatility index was off 0.70 point at 20.32 . 
jerry Hegarty , an analyst with Thomson Financial Services , said volatilities would probably return next week as the market prepares for the March U.S. employment report due out on April 4 . 
&quot; You &apos;ve got a holiday on Friday so things are winding down , but I think it will tick back up again , he said . 
still , Hegarty added that premiums were very plump from a historical standpoint and that the market &apos;s choppiness and relatively wide bid / ask spreads were making outright OEX trading very difficult . 
&quot; It just takes away the idea of speculating when an at-the-money call is $ 15 ( $ 1,500 per OEX contract ) and at-the-money puts are $ 13 , &quot; he said . 
an OEX trader on the CBOE floor said there was a lot of liquidation in out-of-the-money puts as perception spread that the worst was over , at least for the time being . 
&quot; Overall it &apos;s been a pretty quiet day , &quot; he said . 
&quot; A lot of people are just closing out their positions because of the holiday . 
technology stocks again led the market &apos;s rally , with the semiconductor index on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange rising 13.35 points to 278.32 at 1245 CST / 1845 GMT . 
SOXX option volume was moderate , with much of that flow was also in out-of-the-money puts .
