French state bank Caisse des depots et Consignations ( CDC ) on Monday revised higher its estimate for French economic growth in the first quarter 1997 to 0.5 percent from 0.4 percent previously . 
CDC said in a statement , &quot; The indicator points to a moderate improvement , thanks to a still favourable environment on the financial markets . 
the easing of monetary policy continues , albeit at a slower pace than earlier this year , justifying the improvement . 
the seasonally adjusted figures are based on a leading indicator composed of data published up to November 29 . 
CDC left its estimate for 1996 fourth quarter growth unchanged at 0.3 percent , a slowdown after growth of 0.9 percent in the third quarter . 
&quot; The sharp slowdown of economic activity ... is due to weakening consumption of manufactured goods and the deterioration of the job market , &quot; CDC said in a statement . 
CDC said the estimates were a synthetic index , not a forecast .
