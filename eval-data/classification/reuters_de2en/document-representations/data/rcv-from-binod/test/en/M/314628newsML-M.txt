a total of 20.7 million kuna were settled , leaving 10.3 million surplus on the supply side . 
demand stood at 31 million kuna , but was not entirely met as lenders and borrowers failed to agree on terms . 
the rates for fresh interbank borrowings ranged between 10 percent for call money and 13 percent for one-month funds . 
some 5.5 million old loans were rolled over by insurers and banks at 10 to 14 percent , depending on length . 
the central bank calculated its kuna midrates for Saturday and next Monday weaker at 5.7066 from 5.6510 against the dollar and 3.5617 from 3.5570 against the mark .
