European debt markets shuttled higher on Friday after a slightly stronger than expected rise in U.S. non-farm payrolls in January was off-set by a fall in hours worked and a rise in the unemployment rate . 
analysts said the data indicated suggested strong growth in job creation without excessive inflationary pressure . 
&quot; The fall in weekly hours implies a slowing of the economy in the first quarter of this year , &quot; said Tom Hobson , director of director of technical analysis Merrill Lynch in London . 
at 1347 GMT , March German Bund futures were quoted at 102.33 , up 22 basis points and versus 102.19 before the data . 
Gilt futures jumped to a new all-time high of 112-30 after the data , up from 112-12 before . 
March notionnel futures pushed to a new contract high of 131.26 . 
they were up 0.30 at 131.20 , compared with 130.94 before the data . 
U.S. pdayrolls rose 271,000 in January versus forecasts of a 237,000 rise . 
average weekly hours fell to 34.1 from 34.8 in December and average hourly earnings rose only one cent to $ 12.06 . 
analysts said the fall in the hours worked suggested the U.S. economy was further from full capacity than expected . 
&quot; Some people may revise their first quarter GDP estimates down on ( the fall in hours worked ) , &quot; Hobson at Merrill Lynch said . 
&quot; People believe the economy will eventually hit a bottleneck and have cost push inflation , but when you have less hours worked it means that potential is not as strong , &quot; he said . 
in the cash market , British gilts and U.S. treasuries managed to take territory from Bunds after the data . 
the 10-year gilt / Bund spread narrowed to 166 basis points from 170 before the data and the T-note / Bund spread closed in to 84 basis points from 87 before the data . 
&quot; gilts are trading quite well after the data , &quot; said Norman Beauchamp , head of derivatives at the Cooperative Bank in London . 
&quot; Europe is following but not as much . 
that &apos;s been well overdue because the yield between Europe and the U.S. got to silly proportions and now Bonds are taking some of that back , &quot; Beauchamp said . 
on the LIFFE floor , implied volatility of front month options on Bund futures fell to the lows of the year as the futures jumped . 
straddles were trading around 5.27 percent , off from 5.78 percent this morning , traders said . 
in calls , selling into the futures rally saw volatility come off to 5.12 percent . 
however traders said this could also be attributed to the usual Friday volatility decline . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very frothy market . 
volatility was crushed in the front month , &quot; said a trader at a French house at LIFFE . 
&quot; This is a very bullish figure for the market , &quot; said a trader at a British brokerage . 
&quot; T-bonds liked it and the market is prepared to go with it . 
another trader on the LIFFE floor said there was nothing to stop Bund volatility sliding further next week even though it was so low . 
some trade was even seen at sub-5.0 PCT volatility . 
Hobson said technically , the market was still trading short . 
&quot; That &apos;s why we &apos;re seeing Europe , particularly gilts , trading higher , &quot; he said . 
analysts said European debt markets &apos; attention would now turn briefly to the G7 meeting at the weekend , although they expected little fall-out from the talks on Monday morning . 
ongoing concerns over possible delays to European Economic and Monetary Union would also return to dog the market , they said .
