the U.S. Treasury market will ease into trade Wednesday focusing on the government &apos;s five-year note sale and chart-driven activity given an absence until next week of key economic data , market experts said . 
&quot; ( Tuesday &apos;s ) two-year auction was ok ; actually , it turned out better than most people expected , &quot; said Cary Leahey , senior financial market economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc . &quot; But when you have a two-year that goes better than expected , you usually get a five-year that goes worse than expected . 
Treasury will sell $ 12.5 billion in five-year notes at its regular monthly auction on Wednesday . 
the sale follows a $ 17.009 billion auction of two-year notes on Tuesday . 
the two-year paper fetched a yield of 6.46 percent . 
with only the five-year note auction and appearances by two Federal Reserve Bank presidents , economists and dealers said technical factors would dominate Wednesday &apos;s trade . 
&quot; The market is headed lower in terms of price , &quot; said David Ging , technical market analyst at Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp , adding he was not surprised by the long bond &apos;s recent bounce off a cushion of support at 7.07 percent . 
&quot; But that rebound is starting to run out of steam , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The seasonal factors through the middle and end of May point down . 
so it &apos;s looks like we &apos;re going to trade lower into the next ( Fed policy ) meeting . 
Ging said he examined average Treasury price movements from mid-April to mid- to late-May over the past 11 years , and noticed that these so-called &quot; seasonal factors &quot; show a strong tendency for the market to trade lower during that period . 
he said these tendencies were prevalent in each individual year as well as in averages for the 11-year period . 
meanwhile , the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , the central bank &apos;s policy-making arm , next meets on May 20 . 
Central bankers are widely expected to hike short-term interest rates again by 25 basis points at that time . 
Ging said traders were eyeing 7.25 percent for the 30-year yield near term , adding that he expected the quarter-point mark to be tackled &quot; over the next week or two . 
beyond that , Ging said 7.31 percent represented a 61.8 percent retracement target from the 1994 yield high to the 1996 yield low . 
&quot; And then there &apos;s 7.50 after that , &quot; he said . 
separately , the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank will hold a symposium entitled &quot; Assessing the Midwest Economy : looking Back for the Future , &quot; in Chicago . 
the event will start at 0930 EDT / 1330 GMT on Wednesday , and speakers include Chicago Fed President Michael Moskow , Illinois Governor Jim Edgar , and several senior economists from the Chicago Fed . 
in addition , Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Jack Guynn will discuss the U.S. economic outlook and the future of banking at two events in Murfreesboro , Tenn . 
Guynn will address the local Chamber of Commerce and then speak to students , faculty , and members of the community at Middle Tennessee State University . 
&quot; You always have the possibility for &apos; tape bombs , &quot; Leahey said in a reference to comments by Fed and other officials that appear on newswire feeds . 
&quot; But other than those tape bombs , there &apos;s really no data to chew on . 
the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond closed up about 20 / 32 on Tuesday at 94-28 / 32 to yield 7.04 percent .
