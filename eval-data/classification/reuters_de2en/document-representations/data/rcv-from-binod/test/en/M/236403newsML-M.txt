low sulphur straight run was pegged firmer on the back of strong crude , but buying interest was less than enthusiastic . 
&quot; There &apos;s one buyer and two cargoes , so it &apos;s a bit of pressure on prices even with crude , &quot; said one dealer . 
one West African cargo already on the water was sold into New York at the equivalent of around $ 153 CIF . 
Russian straight run was thinner towards the tail end of the week with a NWE M-100 going for around two means -- $ 2 on Wednesday .
