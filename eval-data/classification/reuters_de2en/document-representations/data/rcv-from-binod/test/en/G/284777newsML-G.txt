Philippine President Fidel Ramos said on Thursday winning the war against crime and sealing a peace pact with communist rebels were among his top priorities before he bows out of office in 18 months time . 
the 68-year-old leader , in his televised annual Report to the Nation , also said the Philipppines must not be complacent with the economic progress it had achieved and must try to outstrip the growth of other Asian economies as it enters the next century . 
&quot; We no longer should be satisfied with leapfrogging , for others are leapfrogging , too . 
rather , our aim should be to pole vault -- over those who are merely leaping -- into the 21st century , &quot; he said . 
Ramos , who had surgery 11 days ago to remove a cholesterol blockage impeding the flow of blood to his brain , gesticulated forcefully during his 35-minute speech apparently to dispel any lingering doubts about his state of health . 
he vigorously shook hands with officials , diplomats and businessmen after his address before about 500 guests at the presidential palace . 
Ramos admitted that talks with the communist rebels on ending a 27-year Marxist insurgency had proved difficult but added : &quot; I remain steadfast in the belief that an agreement can , and will , be found . 
&quot; And I believe our communist brethren , like the military rebels and the southern separatists , will yet find their rightful place in civil society , &quot; he added . 
Ramos has reached separate peace deals with right-wing army mutineers linked to coup attempts against his predecessor , Corazon Aquino , and with the Moro National Liberation Front ( MNLF ) which waged a 24-year revolt on southern Mindanao island . 
but three-year-long talks with leftist insurgents have foundered on technicalities . 
Ramos acknowledged he had been less than successful in his efforts to curb major crimes , such as kidnapping for ransom and rape , especially of minors . 
&quot; Civil society has been lacerated by crime these past years . 
if there is one area in which the word &apos; war &apos; is appropriate , it is in our fight against crime , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But no one should doubt that , when the dust has settled , the law will be left standing , &quot; he added . 
Ramos &apos;s pledge to defeat crime came amid mounting media criticism of the police for failing to arrest a congressman belonging to the president &apos;s party who faces charges of raping an 11-year-old girl . 
the hunt for the lawmaker , who is widely believed to be in Manila , is now in its eighth day . 
officials said the Philippine economy , which has grown steadily since Ramos took office in 1992 , was expected to post at least 7.1 percent growth for 1996 , the highest in eight years . 
&quot; We Filipinos have proved that development in Asia-Pacific can take place under a democratic system , &quot; Ramos said .
