China was caught on Thursday in a no-win situation in a row between its old communist comrade , Pyongyang , and a new commercial ally , Seoul , with a North Korean official holed up in the South Korean embassy in Beijing . 
&quot; Whatever way they ( the Chinese ) play it ... it &apos;s impossible to keep both Koreas happy , &quot; one Western diplomat said . 
South Korea said Hwang Jang-yop , a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il , and an assistant were seeking asylum at Seoul &apos;s embassy in Beijing . 
North Korea accused the South of kidnapping Hwang , one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of Pyongyang &apos;s ruling Workers &apos; Party , and urged China to sort out the mess -- in North Korea &apos;s favour . 
diplomats said they saw little opportunity for Beijing to settle the row in its backyard without disappointing the Stalinist North , one of China &apos;s few remaining socialist allies . 
&quot; The inevitable outcome is that the guy will end up in Seoul . 
I can &apos;t see any way around it , &quot; a second diplomat said . 
diplomats said they expected some tough negotiations on the crisis , with Hwang possibly locked inside the South Korean compound for some time . 
South Korea has sent Kim Ha-jung , a special adviser to Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha , to Beijing for talks on the defector &apos;s fate . 
if South Korea can convince China that Hwang sought asylum of his own free will and was not kidnapped , China has little choice but to allow the defector to leave for South Korea , the diplomats said . 
already Beijing was giving a hint of its position . 
Chinese police blocked the sedate , tree-lined avenues leading to South Korea &apos;s consular office in Beijing , where Hwang arrived by taxi on Wednesday to seek asylum . 
the cordon was protection for the compound and its high-profile guest against possible North Korean intrusions rather than to prevent the apparent defector from leaving China , diplomats said . 
&quot; The Chinese will play it according to the rules , &quot; the second Western diplomat said . 
&quot; They won &apos;t stick their nose into the embassy itself . 
that &apos;s something they &apos;ll never do . 
&quot; It ( the cordon ) could be as much for the protection of the South Koreans as anything else because the North Koreans could do anything , &quot; he said . 
&quot; You &apos;d want to make sure there are no untoward incidents . 
Hwang , 73 , was the highest ranking Pyongyang official to seek asylum in South Korea . 
he was in charge of the North Korean communist party &apos;s foreign policy and a member of its powerful central committee , said Seoul officials , who rank him 24th in the Pyongyang power structure . 
but Beijing must placate North Korea , whose friendship China once described as being as close as &quot; lips and teeth &quot; . 
&quot; They &apos;ll have to find some face-saving way to resolve the problem , &quot; the second diplomat said . 
&quot; They ( Chinese ) turned a blind eye in the past to defections through China and that may become a lot more difficult from now on , &quot; he said . 
China has called for calm in the interests of peace and stability in the Korean peninsula while it investigates . 
North and South Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953 . 
China fought on North Korea &apos;s side in the conflict . 
but capitalist South Korea has become an important trading partner and source of investment for China in recent years . 
&quot; There &apos;s far more in the relationship with South Korea for China than ... with North Korea , &quot; the first diplomat said . 
&quot; China &apos;s primary interest in North Korea is that the country doesn &apos;t collapse with refugees flooding across the border and possible nuclear problems , &quot; he said . 
North Korea was suspected in the early 1990s of pursuing a weapons-grade nuclear programme . 
under an agreement signed with Washington in 1994 Pyongyang promised to dismantle the programme in return for safer light-water reactors .
