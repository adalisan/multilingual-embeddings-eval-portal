an alliance of three Slovenian rightwing parties said on Friday it had secured the extra vote in parliament it needed to form the next government . 
the loose &quot; Spring &quot; alliance , comprising the People &apos;s Party , centre-right Social Democrats and Christian Democrats , won 45 out of 90 parliamentary seats in the November 10 general election , missing an absolute majority by just one seat . 
&quot; The 46th vote is no longer in question , &quot; Marjan Podobnik , head of the conservative People &apos;s Party and the &quot; Spring &quot; group &apos;s candidate for prime minister , told a news conference . 
Podobnik , whose People &apos;s Party is the strongest in the alliance with 19 seats , refused to reveal who would supply the crucial vote . 
he said talks aimed at beefing up a coalition government were still continuing . 
&quot; I see no problems in forming the government , the only question is whether we will have a simple or a two-thirds majority , &quot; he said . 
Podobnik declined to speculate on who would be given the first crack at forming a government . 
President Milan Kucan has to name a candidate within 30 days of the first parliamentary session , set for November 28 . 
the &quot; Spring &quot; parties are up against the centre-left Liberal Democrats of Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek , who are the strongest single party with 25 seats . 
the &quot; Spring &quot; alliance approached the Liberal Democrats after the election to offer them a place in government if Drnovsek stepped down as premier , but they refused . 
Podobnik said his government would be in favour of Slovenia joining the European Union and NATO although the new administration would ensure that national interests came first . 
this month &apos;s election was the second since independence .
