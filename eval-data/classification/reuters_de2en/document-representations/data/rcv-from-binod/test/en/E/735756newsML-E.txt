new Zealand consumer confidence continued its recent decline into the June quarter , but remained surprisingly robust for the stage of the economic cycle , WestpactTrust Bank said on Friday . 
the WestpacTrust McDermott Miller Survey of Consumer Confidence showed the index falling to 111.5 in June , down 4.1 index points from the March level of 115.6 and 1.6 points from the June 1996 level of 113.1 . 
&quot; This result continues the gradual downward trend observed in the index since the peak in June 1994 and is consistent with the slowdown in retail sales and general economic growth over that period , &quot; WestpacTrust chief economist Bevan Graham said . 
&quot; While the index has moved lower over the quarter it remains in excess of the important 100 benchmark , indicating more optimists than pessimists . 
this bodes well for a trough in the cycle that is still positive growth , &quot; Graham said . 
&quot; Consumer confidence remains surprisingly robust for this stage of the economic cycle . 
the index component that deteriorated most in the quarter was the economic outlook for the next 12 months . 
Graham said that reflected uncertainty about where the economy was headed following the recent fall in overall growth , the slowdown in the residential property market , and weakening in the labour market . 
respondents were also less optimistic about their future financial situation . 
&quot; This reflects uncertainty surrounding the September referendum on compulsory superannuation , and the resultant uncertainty about next year &apos;s tax cuts , &quot; Graham said . 
on a regional basis , the gap between metropolitan and rural centres continued to close . 
Graham said the recent rebalancing of monetary conditions towards a lower exchange rate and higher interest rates would further narrow the differential between confidence in the rural and metropolitan areas . 
&quot; Consumer confidence can be expected to remain subdued over the remainder of this year , particularly as the labour market continues to weaken in delayed response to the slowdown in overall economic activity and as we head into the superannuation referendum , &quot; Graham said . 
&quot; This suggests a continued tough trading environment for retailers until the end of the year .
