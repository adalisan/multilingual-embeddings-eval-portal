don King won a public purse bid Thursday to promote a World Boxing Council ( WBC ) heavyweight title bout between top contenders Lennox Lewis of Britain and Oliver McCall of the United States . 
King made the winning bid of $ 9.15 million , beating out rival promoters Frank Maloney , who bid $ 6.15 million , and Cedric Kushnar , at $ 5.21 million . 
no date or location was set for the fight to fill the title vacated by Mike Tyson . 
the WBC Tuesday stripped Tyson of its heavyweight title , in line with an order by a New Jersey court earlier this year that Tyson had to fight Lewis before facing World Boxing Association ( WBA ) champion Bruce Seldon . 
Tyson promoter King paid Lewis $ 4 million to step aside and agree that Tyson &apos;s WBC belt would not be on the line against Seldon in their September 7 bout . 
Tyson stopped Seldon in the first round to win the WBA title . 
the Lewis and Tyson camps , however , could not agree to a deal for a bout between their two fighters . 
Tyson , therefore , was stripped by the WBC , adhering to the court ruling . 
Tyson is scheduled to put his new WBA title on the line against former undisputed champion Evander Holyfield on November 9 in Las Vegas .
