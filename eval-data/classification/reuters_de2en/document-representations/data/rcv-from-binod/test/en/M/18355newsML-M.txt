South Korean shares tumbled to a 34-month low on Wednesday , hammered by fears the economy was on a road to a deepening slowdown , market watchers said . 
the sentencing of major business leaders to jail and the prospect of a flood of new stock offerings added to the gloom . 
shares fell 8.40 points to end at 753.35 on Wednesday . 
this was the lowest close since October 30 , 1993 , when the index ended at 750.72 . 
&quot; This was expected , &quot; said a Citizens Investment Trust Co fund manager . 
&quot; Recently , the market had been supported by small-cap shares . 
it was clear that they wouldn &apos;t be able to keep the market up . 
investors have been sour on stocks for the past several months , as a series of negative figures painted a picture of a slowing national economy . 
the trade deficit was $ 10.35 billion in the first seven months of the year , against $ 7.85 billion in the year-ago period . 
concern deepened on Tuesday &apos;s release of second quarter GDP figures that showed the economy had grown at a slower rate this year than last . 
the GDP grew by a real 6.7 percent in the second quarter against 9.7 percent a year ago . 
investors are worried despite analysts &apos; assurances that there was nothing to be concerned about , as last year &apos;s growth had been exceptionally strong . 
the index has fallen 23 percent since the end of April , when it traded at 981 . 
although some bears said the market could fall as far as 700 level , other brokers said they expected the bourse to find its feet soon . 
the market plunged on Monday , when the heads of several of the nation &apos;s largest conglomerates were sentenced to jail for bribing former president Roh Tae-woo . 
the chairmen of the Daewoo , Hanbo , and Jinro groups were each sentenced to two years in prison . 
the chairman of the Dong Ah group companies was handed a 2-1 / 2 year term . 
on Wednesday afternoon , news that Hyundai electronics planned to go public in November further hit sentiment . 
&quot; Hyundai electronics &apos; listing of shares really impacted the sentiment this afternoon , &quot; said Richard Kim of KLB Securities . 
investors believe the market is already suffering from an oversupply of shares . 
five firms have been approved to hold initial public offerings in September , putting 17.55 million more shares on the bourse . 
a further 12 companies hope to list later this year , potentially adding another 23.8 million shares . 
customer deposits at brokerage houses were at around 2.3 trillion won , while margin loans reached 2.6 trillion . 
this was adding to the selling pressure , brokers said . 
Wednesday &apos;s decline was led by small-caps and recent risers . 
young Poong Mining fell 2,800 won ( $ 3.42 ) to 44,700 . 
pharmaceutical shares , which had led buying in recent weeks , plunged . 
the sector fell 86.24 points , or 5.15 percent , to 1,587.62 . 
Dong Shin Pharmaceutical lost 2,700 won to 43,300 and Il Dong Pharmaceutical shed 3,00 won to 47,000 .
