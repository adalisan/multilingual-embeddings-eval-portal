more than 12 million Moroccans have the chance to vote on Friday in a referendum on constitutional reforms that include splitting the existing 333-seat parliament into two chambers . 
King Hassan , 67 , who has called for a &apos; yes &apos; vote , said the constitutional amendment would divide the Majlis Anuwab ( Chamber of Representatives ) into two to strengthen regional representation . 
local councils , professional bodies and trade unions will be represented in the higher house , to be elected through indirect suffrage , while the lower house will be chosen completely by direct vote . 
at present one-third of parliament is appointed by indirect elections . 
despite reservations , the old-guard Istiqlal party and Socialist Union of People &apos;s Forces ( USFP ) -- the country &apos;s main opposition -- have backed the king and called on their supporters to vote in favour of the reform . 
&quot; Our &apos; yes &apos; vote will enable the country to get out of the political impasse and the wait and see situation , &quot; said Mohamed Guessous , a prominent sociologist and leading figure of the USFP . 
he said what was essential in the 108-article draft constitution &quot; is the political will for change and participation of all political forces to find solutions to Morocco &apos;s social and economic problems &quot; . 
King Hassan , who is expected to confer soon with opposition leaders on details of the reform , said the lower house would play a key role in responding to youth demands for jobs . 
an estimated 300,000 young Moroccans enter the job market each year but jobs are scarce and wages are low . 
unemployment is officially said to be 16 percent but opposition trade unions estimate it at 23 percent of Morocco &apos;s 10 million workforce . 
in past referendums on changing the constitution , an average of 98.86 percent voted &apos; yes &apos; for the amendments and more than 92 percent of eligible voters took part , an official said . 
one small leftist group , the avant-garde Socialist and Democratic Party , has called for a boycott , while the Democratic and Popular Action Organisation , which has two seats in parliament , has called for a &apos; no &apos; vote . 
according to interior ministry reports , more than 12 million eligible Moroccans were registered on the voting lists , including those in the disputed Western Sahara provinces . 
more than 118,000 people are expected to vote in the four Western Sahara provinces under Moroccan administration . 
&quot; It should be noted that this is the first time that there is a general consensus and a positive approach on constitutional reforms proposed by the royal palace since 1961 , &quot; a Moroccan senior official said commenting on the opposition decision to vote &apos; yes &apos; . 
King Hassan came to the throne in 1961 and the first referendum on the constitution took place in 1962 . 
Moroccans have been asked to vote eight times since then to amend the constitutions . 
the last changes were made in 1992 .
