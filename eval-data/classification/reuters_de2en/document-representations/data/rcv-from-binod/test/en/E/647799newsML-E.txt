Canadian capacity utilization in total non-farm goods-producing industries rose 0.6 percentage points to 85.0 percent in the first quarter from a revised 84.4 in the fourth , Statistics Canada said on Monday . 
a Reuters survey of economists had forecast the rate to be 84.8 percent in the quarter . 
the fourth-quarter capacity utilization figure was revised from 84.8 percent . 
statistics Canada said industries increased their use of production capacity for the third straight quarter , but there was still a gap of almost two percentage points between the first-quarter level and the 1988 peak of 86.8 percent . 
capacity use a year ago was at 82.1 percent . 
several factors led to increased production in the first quarter of 1997 , StatsCan said . 
export demand rose from the previous quarter , consumer spending was up and construction activity increased , especially residential . 
the federal agency said business spending on new machinery and equipment also rose in the quarter , with manufacturers among the major contributors to the rise in production . 
StatsCan said that industrial output was growing faster than capacity . 
&quot; However , production bottlenecks are not likely to arise due to a lack of capacity even if output keeps growing , &quot; the agency said . 
&quot; Prompted by the increased demands on their production facilities , businesses are expected to spend C $ 42.2 billion on new capacity in 1997 .
