Iranian police seized 503 kg ( 1,100 lb ) of narcotics and arrested one drugs smuggler in northeastern Iran , the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Sunday . 
the agency , monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation , said the narcotics were seized in Fariman , Khorasan province . 
Iran is a key transit route for drugs , mostly opium from which heroin is made , being smuggled to Europe via Turkey from Afghanistan and Pakistan -- the so-called &quot; Golden Crescent &quot; . 
Tehran has said police seized 175 tonnes of drugs in the Iranian year which ended on March 20 . 
Iranian officials say there are about half a million addicts in the country . 
other estimates put the number at up to a million . 
according to Iranian law , possession of five kg ( 11 lb ) of opium or 30 grams ( just over one ounce ) of heroin is punishable by death . 
more than 1,000 people have been executed in drug-related cases since the law took effect in 1989 .
