five years ago , when she was 16 , Marion Jones was perceived by many as the next American sprint queen . 
it appears her time has finally come -- and her time is fast . 
a college basketball career behind her and a twice-broken left foot healed , the lanky California has returned to the track in stunning fashion . 
three times she broke 11 seconds on the way to the women &apos;s 100-meter title at the U.S. championships . 
no one has run faster this season than her 10.92-second semifinal clocking , and her next two times are the second and third fastest of the year . 
the performances have the 21-year-old Jones looking beyond the American horizon . 
&quot; In my mind I am the world &apos;s fastest woman , &quot; said Jones , who also excels as a long jumper . 
&quot; I think she can run 10.7 this year , and that &apos;s being safe , &quot; said her coach , Trevor Graham . 
only one woman , Jamaican Merlene Ottey , ran that fast last year , and only five ever have . 
health and hard work have brought her to the threshold of greatness , Jones said . 
&quot; Words can &apos;t describe how excited I am right now , about making the ( world championships ) team and staying healthy , &quot; said the all-star basketball point guard at the University of North Carolina who twice broke her left foot , the first time in 1995 . 
&quot; She understands the race more now , &quot; said Graham . 
&quot; And she knows that she has to be able to train hard in practice and come back hard the next day . 
before , the only thing she knew was to set up her blocks and run . 
that , and her awesome talent , produced times of 11.14 seconds in the 100 meters and 22.58 seconds in the 200 before she was 17 years old . 
Jones narrowly missed the 1992 U.S. Olympic team , placing fifth in the 100 and fourth in the 200 -- the top three made the team -- and declined an alternate &apos;s spot on the 400-meter relay . 
she attempted a career in both basketball and track after moving across country to North Carolina for college . 
her track work suffered while she and her college team soared to the national basketball title in 1994 . 
the second broken foot ended her dreams of making the 1996 U.S. Olympic athletics team , and it appeared at one point -- with the rising popularity of women &apos;s basketball -- that a pro hoops career might be her future . 
a month ago that changed , with Jones announcing that she was foresaking her final year of college basketball to concentrate on the international track circuit . 
Graham further inspired that desire by showing her videotape of retired world record-holder Florence Griffith Joyner and other world-class sprinters . 
only once , she said , had she regretted not accepting the alternate &apos;s berth on the 1992 Olympic team . 
&quot; That was sitting in my living room and watching the ( 400-meter relay ) team win the gold medal on TV , &quot; she said . 
now there is maturity , and in 11 weeks of training she has finally moved beyond her high school level despite the rustiness of being away from the sport for more than a year . 
Jones has conquered America and now has her sights set on a world title in Athens in August .
