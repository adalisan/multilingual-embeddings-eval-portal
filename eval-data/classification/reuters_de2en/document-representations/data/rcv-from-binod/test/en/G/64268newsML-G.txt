U.S. Cavalry troops flew into Kuwait and a second American aircraft carrier entered the Gulf on Thursday to boost a military buildup aimed at deterring trouble from Gulf War foe Iraq . 
&quot; We are here to deter war ... We are trying to send a signal and that signal is &apos; We are ready &apos; , &quot; U.S. Army Colonel Robert Pollard told reporters . 
about 230 soldiers from the U.S. Army 1st Cavalry Division , some looking tired and jet-lagged , prepared scores of tanks , armoured fighting vehicles and self-propelled howitzer artillery guns at an arsenal north of Kuwait City after a long flight from Fort Hood army base in Texas . 
a U.S. officer said 28 main battle tanks as well as support vehicles would move out of the Camp Doha arsenal and into the desert later on Thursday evening . 
&quot; There are a lot of Kuwaitis who are going to sleep better tonight because the First Cav is here , &quot; said U.S. ambassador to Kuwait Ryan Crocker . 
&quot; This is a tremendously important deployment for the Kuwaitis . 
three thousand more troops were due to arrive overnight and over the next three or four days and deploy rapidly on a desert firing range 40 km ( 25 miles ) from the Iraqi border where the heat can exceed 50 degrees Celsius ( 122 Fahrenheit ) . 
all are carrying chemical and biological warfare protective suits , overgarments and masks , officers said . 
the aircraft carrier Enterprise turned into the Strait of Hormuz to join another carrier battle group , U.S. Navy spokesman Commander T. McCreary said . 
the U.S. Navy now has seven ships in the region capable of firing Tomahawk cruise missiles . 
the latest Iraqi-U.S. confrontation erupted in late August when President Saddam Hussein &apos;s forces intervened to help a Kurdish faction in northern Iraq against a rival Kurdish group . 
Washington retaliated by firing 44 cruise missiles at air defence targets in south Iraq on September 3 and 4 . 
a Kuwaiti official said tension with Baghdad had subsided slightly but Kuwait &apos;s &quot; crisis &quot; with Iraq was not over , noting Iraq was still believed to have Scud missiles . 
&quot; The threat will stay as long as Saddam Hussein is in power , &quot; the official said by telephone . 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and was driven out seven months later by a U.S.-led coalition of international forces . 
Western diplomats said that without serious provocation from Baghdad the likelihood of a strike on Iraq was now slight . 
&quot; You cannot have a fixed game plan that is rigid , &quot; one said . 
&quot; But the coalition is not itching for a fight ... 
the option is there for this to de-escalate without Iraq having to do anything humiliating . 
the new troops will reinforce 1,200 already in Kuwait to form a more than 4,000-strong Task Force , Kuwait , that will exercise for several months with Kuwaiti forces and other allies , U.S. officers said without elaborating . 
&quot; Iraq has violated the no-fly zone . 
he ( Saddam ) continues to flex his muscles , &quot; said Pollard , task force chief of staff . 
&quot; Therefore we have to continue to deploy our forces .... first to keep the peace in the region , secondly to protect ( U.S ) national interests in the region . 
at Doha , which houses 1,600 tanks and 70 armoured fighting vehicles among other weaponry , soldiers began loading bottled water into tanks and vehicles and laying out green kit bags . 
the buildup also includes the deployment in Kuwait of eight stealth bombers , over 20 other U.S. warplanes and Patriot missiles and B-52 bombers on an Indian Ocean island .
