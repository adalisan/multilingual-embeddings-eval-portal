China &apos;s stock indices ended mostly higher on Thursday with the Shanghai foreign currency B market the one dissenting voice in the crowd . 
Shanghai &apos;s foreign currency B shares edged down on Thursday in stable trading , erasing morning gains , brokers said . 
the B share market had gained in Thursday morning trading on buying of recently listed issues , including Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co Ltd and Hainan Airlines Co , they said . 
however , the B index slipped 0.121 points or 0.16 percent to 74.182 points at the close on moderate turnover of $ 7.132 million , compared with $ 9.841 million on Wednesday . 
&quot; The B shares were relatively stable and turnover was very light , &quot; said an analyst at Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities . 
&quot; Trading will be stable in the short term and I don &apos;t expect any bad news , &quot; he said . 
Shanghai Yaohua Pilkington Glass Co was the biggest B share loser on speculative selling , plunging $ 0.030 or 9.09 percent to $ 0.300 . 
Zhenhua Port , which listed earlier this week , was the most actively traded share and the top gainer in the falling market . 
the stock surged $ 0.052 or 9.85 percent to $ 0.580 on volume of around 2.1 million shares . 
domestic currency A shares reversed early losses on buying of companies which also had H shares listed in Hong Kong , brokers said . 
H shares , shares of Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong , had recently performed strongly , they said . 
the Shanghai A share index jumped 29.390 points or 2.40 percent to 1,255.191 points on turnover of 3.074 billion yuan against 2.788 billion yuan on Wednesday . 
Shanghai &apos;s SSE30 blue chip rose 61.517 points or 1.67 percent to 3,749.004 points . 
Shenzhen &apos;s hard currency B share index ended minimally higher in dull trading , helped by institutional support just before the close , brokers said . 
they said they expected the index to move around current levels in the short term due to an absence of new incentives . 
&quot; The index is expected to hold steady in the near future . 
Shenzhen &apos;s domestic A share index gained 3.87 points or 0.96 percent to 407.39 points on turnover of 4.4 billion yuan against 4.0 billion yuan in the previous session . 
a spurt of buying of Beijing Orient electronics just before the market closed helped lift the B share index , brokers said . 
the company on Monday posted a 29 percent year-on-year jump in its 1997 interim net profits , which reached 68.72 million yuan under international accounting standards .
