the Czech PX50 index closed lower on Friday despite a major issue rebound spearheaded by Komercni Banka . 
the PX50 closed down 0.6 points to 504.1 while the major issue dominated RPIX rose six to 1,032 . 
Komercni Banka , which on Friday released nine month financial results , rose 126 crowns to 2,126 . 
the bank posted nine month net profits of 4.8 billion crowns compared with 5.4 billion in the same period in 1995 but dealers said the results were as expected and reflected changes in company accounting procedures rather than fundamentals . 
they added that a signficant element of Komercni &apos;s rise was due to interest from foreign investors . 
&quot; Some of the foreign investors are familiar with the results and they think they are not so bad therefore we can see some demand in the stock , &quot; he said . 
SPT Telecom , which along with Komercni had been one of the most prolific decliners of the week , also moved higher . 
activity on the bourse was moderate , with turnover at 906 million crowns and volume at just over one million shares .
