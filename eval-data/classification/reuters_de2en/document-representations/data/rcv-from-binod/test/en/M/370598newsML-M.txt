U.S. West Coast spot unleaded gasoline and diesel prices eased on Monday in quiet discussion as sellers came off asking prices across the board , traders said . 
the weaker prices still were not enough to scare up buyers in late trade . 
&quot; It &apos;s dead . 
stick a fork in it , &quot; one trader said of the dearth of activity in the cash market . 
sellers were asking 72 cents a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline in Los Angeles and 70 cents a gallon in San Francisco , with few deals heard done . 
CARB diesel was talked 82 / 83 cents a gallon and low sulphur diesel was talked 74 / 75 cents a gallon in both markets , traders said . 
Short-covering that pushed up NYMEX heating oil and gasoline prices in late floor session trade had no impact on valuations in the West Coast markets , traders said .
