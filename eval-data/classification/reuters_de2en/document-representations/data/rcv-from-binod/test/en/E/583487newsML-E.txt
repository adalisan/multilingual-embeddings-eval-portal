the Federal Reserve is likely to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point next week in another bid to insure against potential overheating of the economy , sources close to the Fed said . 
&quot; There is a very good chance the Fed will do another 25 basis points ( quarter percentage point ) , and virtually no chance it will do 50 basis points , &quot; one source told Reuters . 
a second source close to the central bank noted that U.S. financial markets were not yet helping the Fed restrain growth , indicating the need for another move . 
the central bank &apos;s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans by a quarter point to 5.50 percent in March . 
it was the first time in more than two years that the Fed raised rates to address the potentially inflationary strength of the economy . 
fed policy-makers meet next Tuesday to consider whether to raise rates . 
the Fed left the discount rate , the rate it charges banks for direct loans , unchanged in March . 
the first source said that whether a hike in the fed funds rate would be accompanied by a discount rate increase &quot; would be entirely at the discretion of the ( Fed ) chairman &quot; Alan Greenspan . 
&quot; If you don &apos;t believe a fundamental change has taken place in the economy , you have to be wary about the numbers that came out , &quot; the source said , referring to the 5.6 percent rise in the Gross Domestic Product in the first quarter . 
the source also was referring to April &apos;s 4.9 percent unemployment rate that pointed to very tight labour markets . 
analysts have cited higher-than-expected growth in the labour force as a reason why tight labour markets have not yet translated into rapidly rising wages . 
&quot; That last report scored a point to the view the period of rapid labour force growth is over , &quot; the source added , noting the decline in the size of the workforce from March to April . 
the source acknowledging , however , that the Fed was expecting a slowdown &quot; from the clearly unsustainable &quot; pace of the past two quarters . 
&quot; The question is when the slowdown will come . 
the answer keeps being postponed , &quot; the source pointed out . 
&quot; The slowdown was supposed to come in the fourth quarter and Q4 came as a surprise on the upside . 
at this point , some of us are getting wary about confidently predicting the slowdown is imminent . 
private economists are forecasting a second-quarter slowdown as the large surge in inventories in the first quarter should subtract from subsequent growth . 
the second source said the Fed &apos;s move in March had failed to spark any market restraint and that more tightening was necessary . 
&quot; The only thing that would make the Fed pause is if we get a lot more slowdown here . 
it &apos;s the third and fourth quarter that are at issue here , &quot; the source stressed .
