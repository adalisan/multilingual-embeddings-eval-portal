prices for U.S. sour crude grade differentials continued to firm late Tuesday against a slightly weaker outright crude market . 
traders said West Texas sour / Midland was sold 15 cents stronger late in the session , switching hands at a discount of $ 2.05 to the May West Texas Intermediate / Cushing benchmark . 
firmer prices for sour barrels were the result of the closure of two Mexican crude ports the previous four days , delaying at least two large shipments of Maya barrels . 
temporary production glitches at the Shell-operated Mars platform in the Gulf of Mexico also propped WTS values . 
Mexican officials said Dos Bocas and Pajaritos crude exporting ports would remain closed Tuesday , and possibly through Wednesday as a result of high winds . 
there were two ships waiting to load a total of two million barrels of Maya heavy crude at Dos Bocas , while five tankers were waiting to load and a four others waiting to sail from Parajitos . 
in addition to Mexican ports and Mars , traders said a threatened strike by pilots guiding tankers in and out of Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela &apos;s oil region also supported prices . 
light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James was steady to slightly weaker at 33-37 cts under the benchmark , with Midland / WTI steady at 29-32 cts below the mark . 
postings Plus sold 4 cts higher than Monday at $ 1.81 . 
traders said losses on outright crude markets were the result of bearish expectations for inventory reports . 
actual American Petroleum Institute ( API ) data showed crude stocks 2.97 million barrels higher , gasoline stocks down 267,000 barrels and distillates up 2.59 million barrels . 
forecasts had projected a slightly larger build in crude , but a more bullish performance for distillate levels . 
cold temperatures in the U.S. Northeast were expected to cause a draw in heating oil supplies . 
may WTI / Cushing was talked late at $ 19.75-85 a barrel , more than 10 cts lower than late Monday , with the June month losing its advantage to the May by around 5 cts .
