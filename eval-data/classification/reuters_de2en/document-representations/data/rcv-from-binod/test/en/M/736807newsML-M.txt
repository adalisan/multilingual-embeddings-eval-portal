wall Street was expected to open mixed to slightly higher on Thursday , riding a wave of positive momentum after the Dow industrials powered past the 8,000-point mark yesterday , but subject to mild profit-taking . 
stocks could face some profit-taking after the Dow Jones Industrial average closed up 63 points at 8039 , analysts said . 
but a steady stream of corporate earnings , including results from several Dow components and Microsoft Corp , could then provide fresh impetus to move higher . 
&quot; The momentum is there and the earnings reports have been good , &quot; Peter Cardillo , director of research at Westfalia Investments , said . 
&quot; We should go higher even from a technical standpoint . 
as we approach options expiry tomorrow , that should fuel the markets &apos; upward momentum . 
they were forecast at 1.45 million , compared with 1.397 million in May . 
&quot; Right now we look set to open a little mixed to higher , &quot; Larry Wachtel , an analyst at prudential Securities , said .

in early trade , the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 futures index rose 0.70 points to 943.00 . 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond , which pierced resistance to break through a key 6.50 percent yield yesterday , was flat at 6.48 percent .

giant technology company Microsoft Corp was also set to report fourth quarter earnings .
