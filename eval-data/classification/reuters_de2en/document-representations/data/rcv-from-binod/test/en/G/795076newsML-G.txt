the people of Shanghai , China &apos;s richest city , are spending one billion yuan ( $ 120 million ) a year on pets that include wolves and insects , and are developing a taste for the virtual kind , Business News said on Tuesday . 
the market for live pets was now 10 times the size it was a decade ago , the newspaper said . 
whereas 10 years ago , Shanghai people bought dogs , cats , birds and fish to raise as pets , today they bought squirrels , yellow-skinned wolves and a wide variety of insects , it said . 
the craze for virtual pets , or Tamagotchi , that has swept Asia had also bitten Shanghai &apos;s pet lovers , it said , without giving further details . 
Tamagotchi , egg-shaped Japanese electronic pet toys with a small screen showing a pet that has to be fed , cleaned and put to sleep , have taken off in China , with one Beijing department store reporting sales of 50,000 in three months .
