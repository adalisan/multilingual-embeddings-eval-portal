Shanghai &apos;s foreign currency B shares inched higher on Monday morning in cautious trading on optimism the government would announce policies to help state enterprises , brokers said . 
but investors were wary after Shanghai Lujiazui Finance &amp; Trade Zone Development Co reported poor results . 
the firm on Friday posted net profits of 179.376 million yuan for the first half , down 67 percent from the first half of 1996 . 
the B index rose 0.030 points or 0.04 percent to 74.953 points on moderate turnover of $ 3.396 million , compared with $ 11.614 million on Friday morning . 
investors bought on expectations that the government would announce new policies to help to bail out state firms , which would also benefit some listed companies , brokers said . 
but the drop in profits of Lujiazui , which was to resume trading in the afternoon following a suspension for its results announcement , capped the gains , they said . 
Lujiazui , a property developer with ties to Shanghai &apos;s Pudong development zone , attributed the fall in interim net profits to losses by a subsidiary . 
&quot; Most foreign investors eased their buying of newly-listed shares today , resulting in some weakness in prices and shrinking volume , &quot; said a broker at a foreign securities firm . 
buying of newly listed shares -- including Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal Co Ltd and Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co -- had pushed the B share market up last week . 
the three most heavily traded shares on Monday morning included Yitai , recently listed Hainan Airlines Co and Zhenhua -- all of which showed falls in the morning . 
of 47 B shares , 36 shares traded with 17 up , 11 down and eight flat . 
domestic currency A shares fell on Monday morning due to a technical correction after recent gains , brokers said . 
the A index lost 13.351 points or 1.06 percent to 1,248.828 on turnover of 2.225 billion yuan against 2.327 billion in the previous morning session . 
the SSE30 blue chip index fell 36.576 points or 0.96 percent to 3,783.958 points . 
the B share market was likely to fall in afternoon trading after Lujiazui resumed trading , but bargain-hunting was expected at lower levels , brokers said .
