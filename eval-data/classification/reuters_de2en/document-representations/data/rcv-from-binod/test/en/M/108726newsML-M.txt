Toronto stocks ended softer after a brisk session on Thursday as Canada &apos;s biggest stock market consolidated its recent gains , analysts said . 
declining stocks outnumbered advances 481 to 427 with 289 issues ending flat . 
&quot; I think the markets are going through a consolidative phase , &quot; said Subodh Kumar , chief equity strategist for CIBC Wood Gundy Inc . 
Toronto followed a weak performance in New York where the Dow Jones average lost nearly nine points . 
Kumar said investors will be focused on the flood of third quarter earnings beginning today with Alcan Aluminium Ltd . 
Canadian financial markets are also pondering whether the strong Canadian dollar will give the Bank of Canada room to cut short-term interest rates again . 
the central bank last cut rates on October 2 , dropping its key bank rate to 4.0 percent which prompted Canada &apos;s chartered banks to lower their prime lending rates . 
&quot; If the bank feels it needs to boost the domestic economy , they have the opportunity to do it , &quot; Kumar said . 
* Alcan Aluminium ended up 0.35 at 40.75 on 679,000 shares after returning to profit in the third quarter . 
* Gold producer Franco-Nevada Mining Corp Ltd. jumped 1.35 to 52.60 on 262,000 shares on higher second quarter earnings . 
among other gold stocks , Bre-X Minerals Ltd. sank 1 to 24.05 on 3.7 million shares . 
the company said today its lawyers are working around the clock to resolve a dispute with one of Bre-X &apos;s Indonesian partners . 
* West Fraser Timber Co Ltd. fell 1 to 35.50 . 
forest products firms are set to report lower third-quarter profits due to weak prices , high inventories and slackening demand .
