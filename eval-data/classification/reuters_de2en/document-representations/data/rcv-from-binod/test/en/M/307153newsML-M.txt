three months delivery copper prices are set to fall to a low of $ 1,650 per tonne this year as production continues to overwhelm consumption , brokers GNI forecast in a report . 
this compares to a nadir of $ 1,745 in 1996 and values just above $ 2,250 now . 
the copper market , however , could remain fairly tight in the first quarter , buoyed by Japanese purchases ahead of the GSP tax holiday in April , but declining to $ 1,800 by mid-year . 
&quot; From there , excess supplies should be more noticeable and GNI estimates that prices will hit a low of $ 1,650 per tonne in 1997 , and average $ 1,900 for the year , &quot; the 1997 Outlook report said . 
production would rise to 12.87 million tonnes in 1997 from 12.14 the previous year while consumption would increase to 12.48 million tonnes from 11.94 million . 
the surplus would widen to 391,000 tonnes from 203,000 in 1996 . 
aluminium prices would peak at $ 1,750 per tonne this year , bottom out at $ 1,500 , with an average of $ 1,600 for the year . 
the market would move into a deficit of 210,000 tonnes after a surplus of 303,000 tonnes in 1996 .
