worldwide tight supply of indium could see prices pushed up as high as $ 300 per kg before mid-year , traders in the Far East said on Tuesday . 
traders polled by Reuters said prices for the minor metal were now hovering around $ 250 to $ 270 a kg because Chinese producers had sold out of stock for the next two to three months . 
prices for indium ingots were indicated in London last week at $ 220 / 250 per kg . 
one trading source in southern Guangdong province said he sold 100 kg of Chinese indium to Japanese end-users on Monday , at $ 278 a kg . 
he said he paid a Chinese trading company $ 265 a kg for the material . 
with costs of $ 3 per kg , he cleared $ 10 per kg , he said . 
a source in Hong Kong said she paid one of the major Chinese producers $ 182 per kg before the Chinese New Year holiday earlier this month . 
part of her purchase had been sold in the United States at around $ 200-220 per kg , she said . 
Chinese producers , notably the Zhuzhou and Huludao zinc smelters , had not picked up production since the country went back to work on February 17 after the two-week new-year break , traders said . 
producers elsewhere , such as Belgium , Canada and Peru , were locked into long-term contracts . 
Russia was offering material at high prices . 
traders said they did not expect supply to loosen -- or prices to soften -- for the next two or three months . 
Indium is a by-product of zinc production and is used in the manufacture of semi-conductors . 
traders said China was oversold until at least April , making the material extremely difficult to find . 
&quot; We are trying to find indium , &quot; said the senior representative in China of a major European firm . 
&quot; The whole world is looking for indium , and everyone expects the price to go to $ 300 a kg before too long , &quot; he said . 
traders in Japan , China and Hong Kong said cobalt prices continued to be soft , partly reflecting speculative moves to push down prices after a sale by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency on February 20 . 
&quot; There is speculation that some traders were trying to push down cobalt prices artificially , which was believed to be related with a dla sale , &quot; a trader at a major Tokyo trading house said . 
continued fighting between government and rebel forces in Zaire , the world &apos;s major cobalt producer , was not yet providing support to prices , trader said . 
cobalt cathodes were indicated in London last week at $ 20.50 / 21.50 a lb , and cobalt ingots at $ 18.50 / 19.50 a lb . 
a trading source in Hong Kong quoted cobalt ingots at $ 18.70 / 80 fob Chinese ports , and said she saw prices softening another 10 cents a pound before a rebound . 
a Tokyo trader said , however , he expected the tight market to produce a rebound in the short term . 
antimony was still near but not quite at the bottom of its current fall , another trader in the British colony said . 
Chinese traders were offering antimony ingots at $ 2,250 a tonne , inclusive of cost and freight ( c &amp; f ) Rotterdam , compared to last week &apos;s European quotes of $ 2,275 / $ 2,375 per tonne . 
&quot; This $ 2,250 is the price they ( Chinese sellers ) want , but the buyers just aren &apos;t there so if you bargain you can get it for $ 2,200 a tonne , &quot; she said . 
traders gave the following current prices for minor metals , on a CIF basis at major Japanese ports , except antimony , which is fob Southern China : 
Feb 25 Feb 18 
cobalt ( high grade , $ / 1b ) 19.50 / 20.50 20.50 / 21.50 
cobalt ( Russian , $ / 1b ) 17.50 / 18.50 17.50 / 18.50
