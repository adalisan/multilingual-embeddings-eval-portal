Sri Lanka suffered more setbacks on the third morning of the first cricket test against New Zealand at Carisbrook on Sunday . 
the tourists were precariously placed at 150 for seven in their first innings at the lunch break in pursuit of New Zealand &apos;s mammoth 586 for seven declared . 
the Sri Lankans need to score a further 237 runs just to avoid the follow on . 
Sri Lanka resumed play already in trouble at 78 for four and their position quickly deteriorated after only one run was added when skipper Arjuna Ranatunga followed a wide delivery from fast-medium Bowler Simon Doull only to edge the ball to Bryan Young at second slip . 
Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana did not lose heart , hitting out boldly to score 43 and take the tourists total through to 135 when he was out in bizarre circumstances . 
he leaned forward to defend a delivery from offspinner Dipak Patel and the ball became jammed between the gloves and the top flap of his front pad . 
Kaluwitharana remained stationary for several seconds and Stephen Fleming , fielding in close , rushed in and grabbed the ball before it fell to the ground . 
umpire Ian Robinson , of Zimbabwe , adjudged Kaluwitharana out caught by Fleming . 
the third wicket to fall in the morning session was that of Chaminda Vaas who drove Patel uppishly to mid-on where Matt Horne accepted a comfortable catch . 
Doull was the most successful Bowler , on four for 55 , while Patel had two for 30 and Heath Davis one for 33 .
