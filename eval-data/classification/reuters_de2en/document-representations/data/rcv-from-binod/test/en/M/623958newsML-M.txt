CSCE coffee futures remained sharply higher ahead of midday Thursday , but a round of profit-taking knocked the July contract off a new 20-year peak hit earlier in the session , traders said . 
fueled by frenzied broad-based buying , the benchmark July contract burst to a new lifetime high of 315.00 cents a lb -- a level not seen since 1977 -- before profit takers stemmed the rally . 
Second-month September was 15.20 higher , at 271.90 , while the back months were up the 6.00-cent limit . 
coffee prices gapped up more than 9.00 cents at the outset , as broad-based buying followed on the heels of steep gains in London overnight . 
dealers said a 500-lot order by one trade house got the market off to a strong start . 
with bullish sentiment running strong , some traders said the market was likely to revisit today &apos;s highs before the close . 
nothing has changed , the fundamentals are still strong . 
low inventory levels , combined with the fast-approaching winter in Brazil , are likely to keep prices well underpinned , traders said . 
&quot; How can you sell this market with the potential of cold weather coming ? , &quot; said one analyst . 
&quot; temperatures are cooler and the fact that we &apos;re coming into the heart of the cold weather season with the low stock levels we have makes this rally more sustainable . 
with the $ 3 level out of the way , traders said the next critical upside objective was 340.70 cents , the all-time record high futures price set April 14 , 1977 .
