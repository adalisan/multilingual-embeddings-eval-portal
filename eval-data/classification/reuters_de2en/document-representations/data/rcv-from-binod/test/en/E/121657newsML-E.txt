Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said on Wednesday that he was unable to tell if there was room to lower interest rates in Germany . 
in an interview with daily Le Monde , Tietmeyer said the Bundesbank did not start with the principle that rates would have to be raised in the near term . 
&quot; Central rates have reached historically low levels . 
naturally we continue to observe very attentively the unfolding of the situation . 
and we do not start from the principle that we will have to raise rates in the near term , &quot; Tietmeyer said . 
&quot; I cannot , however , say if there is still a little room underneath , &quot; he added . 
Tietmeyer also said in the interview that he did not think economic growth in Germany and other European countries was restricted by monetary policy . 
&quot; &quot; It is important to note that growth , in Germany and other European countries , is not handicapped by monetary policy . 
&quot; There is enough liquidity available , the volume of money is sufficient . 
interest rates have never been so low , at least those over which central banks have influence , &quot; Tiemeyer said . 
&quot; In this regard , I do not see any danger of deflation .
