the zloty should remain in its range between one and two percent above the parity rate in the second half of 1997 if foreign direct investment continues to largely offset the current account deficit , ING Barings said . 
ING Barings said in a fixed income research report dated June 13 , that medium and long-term prospects for the zloty will largely depend on Poland &apos;s external balance , which has been fast deteriorating in the first months of 1997 . 
&quot; The zloty is undervalued when compared to its relative purchasing power parity exchange rate , reinforcing the view that any downside for the currency is limited , &quot; it said . 
the report said the National Bank of Poland , the central bank , was sensitive to the level of foreign exchange reserves and would not want them to fall by a large amount . 
it said the present one percent per month zloty devaluation rate would probably be maintained for the whole year , although a cut to 0.7 percent per month was possible in the fourth quarter if the current account gap held below about four percent of GDP . 
on Friday , the zloty traded around 1.5 percent above the parity rate , the level of a central bank-enforced resistance . 
the zloty is traded in a 14 percent band around a central parity rate set by the central bank daily according to the value of a basket of five Western currencies and a crawling peg devaluation factor .
