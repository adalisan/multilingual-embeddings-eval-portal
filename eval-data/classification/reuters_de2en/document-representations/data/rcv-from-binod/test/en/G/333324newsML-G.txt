world number one tennis player Pete Sampras won the ninth Grand Slam title of his career on Sunday when he crushed Spain &apos;s Carlos Moya in the Australian Open tennis tournament final . 
the 25-year-old American played at the top of his form to beat the unseeded Moya 6-2 6-3 6-3 in just 87 minutes . 
both men started strongly , serving aces in their opening service games , but top seed Sampras broke Moya &apos;s serve in the fourth game of the match and never looked back . 
Moya , a natural baseliner , was unable to produce the kind of all-round court game which earned him wins over defending champion Boris Becker and world number two Michael Chang on his way to the final . 
visibly nervous in his first Grand Slam final , Moya made unforced errors throughout the match . 
although the Spaniard came into the game more strongly in the second and third sets , Sampras dominated both from the net and the baseline throughout . 
he served 12 aces . 
Sampras &apos;s victory takes him further up on the podium of tennis greats . 
in the post-1968 Open era of tennis , only Sweden &apos;s Bjorn Borg has won more Grand Slam men &apos;s singles titles , with 11 wins from 16 finals . 
it also props up Sampras &apos; remarkable win rate in Grand Slam finals , where he has won nine of 11 tournaments . 
the only major title to elude him is the French Open . 
the win will also help Sampras put behind him the death last year of his coach and mentor , Tim Gullikson , from a brain tumour . 
&quot; Last year was a very tough year , losing my coach Tim Gullikson , &quot; Sampras told the Centre Court crowd as he received his silver championship cup . 
&quot; To have that support from my family and my good friends really got me through it . 
Moya , 20 , started the tournament ranked number 25 in the world , one of an Armada of Spanish clay court specialists who have recently started to win on hardcourts . 
his appearance in the final will see him rise to number nine . 
Moya &apos;s long brown hair and film-star good looks made him a tournament heart-throb . 
he was warmly cheered by the Centre Court crowd after the final but received a light-hearted jeer when he thanked his girlfriend for her support .
