1500 GMT - Swiss shares ended a listless and rangebound session slightly higher after posting moderate gains on the back of Wall Street &apos;s strength on Friday before shifting into a sideways trading pattern . 
&quot; The fundamentals continue to look good , but I think the SMI will hover around 3,800 points until the end of the week &quot; , one dealer said , noting that Friday &apos;s expiry on options and futures may lead to some price volatility in blue-chip shares .
