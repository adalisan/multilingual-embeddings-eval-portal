Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila , whose forces already control one-third of the giant Central African country and are steadily gaining ground , has offered face-to-face talks with President Mobutu Sese Seko . 
&quot; I think we should speak together , face-to-face , and go much further , much faster than the discussions that are taking place all over the place led by foreigners , &quot; Kabila told Belgian RTBF radio on Monday in what was flagged as an exclusive interview . 
he dismissed the seeming offer at the weekend of an olive branch when Mobutu described his arch enemy in an interview with South Africa &apos;s Sunday Times as a &quot; nationalist patriot &quot; . 
&quot; It is not impossible that everyone can change sides with reality on the ground , &quot; Kabila said . 
&quot; For me I say ... we must go beyond that declaration and I would hope for a meeting ... to put an end to the suffering of our people through a peaceful transition of power . 
&quot; Mobutu himself knows that his departure is necessary in the interests of his own country , my country . 
I cannot see any other politicial possibilities for the reconstruction of the country that has not happened in 32 years of ( his ) power , &quot; he said . 
Kabila &apos;s rebels appeared poised on Monday to march on Lubumbashi , Zaire &apos;s second city and capital of the mineral-rich Shaba province , and strengthen their hand at peace talks taking place at a secret location in South Africa . 
the rebels said they would take the Zairean capital Kinshasa by the end of June . 
the rebels have won control of about one-third of the vast country since October but Mobutu , who seized power in 1965 , has shown no sign of bowing out . 
no word filtered out about any progress in the peace negotiations , brokered by the United Nations and South Africa . 
the negotiators moved to a secret location after a frosty start in Pretoria on Saturday when rebel envoy Bizima Karaha in effect told the Kinshasa government delegation it was now or never if they wanted a peaceful settlement . 
in the rebel-held city of Kisangani international relief workers faced daunting obstacles in trying to airlift home 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees trapped by the war . 
decrepit airports are a source of concern and Rwanda has yet to confirm that it will accept planeloads of Hutu refugees , some of whom it links to the 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis there . 
the U.N. human rights investigator for Zaire said the Tutsi-dominated rebels had massacred civilians and Rwandan Hutu refugees after their conquest of eastern Zaire . 
the rebels took up arms in October in a dispute over Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis and have vowed to oust Mobutu , who has rarely been in the country since undergoing prostate cancer surgery in Europe in August .
