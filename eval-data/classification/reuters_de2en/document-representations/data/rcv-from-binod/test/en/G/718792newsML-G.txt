a Sudanese newspaper said on Thursday that a militia allied with Sudan &apos;s government had recaptured two southern towns from rebels . 
the private Alwan newspaper said the Southern Sudan Defence Force ( SSDF ) on Tuesday retook Warap and Tali , more than 960 km ( 600 miles ) south of the capital Khartoum . 
it gave no source for the report . 
the Islamist government in April signed a peace accord with a number of factions now allied in the SSDF . 
Alwan also said the SSDF had attacked rebel Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) forces in Duk Fadiat and Duk Faiwil areas , about 840 km ( 520 miles ) south of the capital . 
for 14 years the government has been fighting the SPLA , which wants greater autonomy or independence for the mostly Christian and animist south from the Moslem , Arabised north .
