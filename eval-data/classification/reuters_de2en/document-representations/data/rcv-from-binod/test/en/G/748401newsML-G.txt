Sam Torrance is a doubtful starter for this week &apos;s Dutch Open after straining pectoral muscles while working out in the gym . 
the Briton , a member of the winning Ryder Cup team two years ago , said on Wednesday that he would decide on Thursday , the opening day of the 700,000 pound sterling ( $ 1.8 million ) tournament , whether to compete . 
Italian Costantino Rocca , Torrance , Ignacio Garrido of Spain and Briton Mark James are the top Europeans competing in the event . 
one of the four , ranked ninth , 13th , 14th and 15th respectively in the Ryder Cup standings , could virtually seal a place on the Valderrama team by taking the 116,660 pound ( $ 196,000 ) first prize . 
the Open is one of only six events left before the team for Valderrama is chosen . 
the Open is already short of big names and promoter Robbie van Erven Dorens said top players had priced themselves out of the event . 
&quot; We could have made it a 300,000-pound event and paid out 400,000 pounds in pay-and-play money , &quot; said van Erven Dorens . 
&quot; But those days are over . 
it would be a terrible disservice to other players to do that . 
Zimbabwe &apos;s Mark McNulty will be on hand to defend his title .
