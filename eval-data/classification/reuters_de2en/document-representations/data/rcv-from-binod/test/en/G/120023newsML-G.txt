U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry warned Russia on Wednesday that a refusal to approve the START-2 treaty would cost Moscow and Washington billions of dollars and would not delay NATO &apos;s spread into eastern Europe . 
&quot; Reducing the number of weapons you have by half has to be a cost saver , &quot; Perry told reporters en route to Moscow for a visit during which he will testify on Thursday to parliament in support of the treaty , ratified by the U.S. Senate this year . 
the State Duma is expected to vote on ratification this year and Perry said rejection would cost the U.S. and cash-strapped Russia billions of dollars more to maintain strategic nuclear weapons at current levels than to further reduce their Cold War stockpiles under the treaty . 
&quot; There are shutdown costs with closing down a missile programme , &quot; he conceded in response to hostility in the Duma , the lower house of Parliament , over slashing U.S. and Russian strategic warheads from 6,000 each to about 3,000 each by the year 2003 under START-2 . 
&quot; In the United States that ( dismantling cost ) is measured in several hundreds of millions of dollars . 
but the savings we estimate from the START treaty are measured in billions of dollars , &quot; Perry stressed . 
the START-2 nuclear arms reduction treaty was signed in 1993 but there is now strong opposition in the Duma and other circles to the treaty because of the cost and a feeling of vulnerability over the economic and military turmoil in Russia . 
a Russian Defence Ministry official told Interfax news agency on Tuesday the treaty would have to be amended before the Duma would ratify it , but gave no details . 
Perry , due to hold talks with Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov later on Wednesday , said Washington would not allow the Duma to use START-2 as a bargaining chip to keep NATO from extending membership to former Soviet bloc states , expected to initially include Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see a connection between these two issues , &quot; he said when asked about strong Russian opposition to the idea of extending NATO close to Russia &apos;s borders . 
&quot; The benefits of START-2 to both the United States and to Russia speak for themselves and stand by themselves . 
and I will address them on that basis and will be prepared to defend and justify them on that basis , &quot; he said of Thursday &apos;s testimony to members of the Duma . 
&quot; I think there are some misconceptions some of them have about START-2 . 
I welcome the opportunity to try to deal with those misconceptions . 
for example , the view that START-2 is too expensive , &quot; he said . 
Republican U.S. 
Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut , travelling with Perry , also said Russian rejection of START-2 or a demand that the treaty be amended would be a financial and military setback for both countries . 
&quot; Extending the time period ( of START-2 ) does not save money , it simply extends the expense , &quot; said Lugar , who co-sponsored the Nunn-Lugar law which has provided $ 750 million to Russia since 1992 to help reduce weapons of mass destruction and protect them from falling into the hands of terrorists . 
&quot; An amendment would take us back to the beginning and , I think , would be a real setback , &quot; added Lieberman . 
democratic Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia was flying to Moscow separately and was scheduled to travel with the others to a Russian naval base near the Arctic Circle on Friday to watch nuclear missile submarines being destroyed under the START-1 treaty . 
Perry and the senators will also hold talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday but it was not clear whether they would meet outspoken Russian security chief Alexander Lebed .
