France believes Nigerian troops will restore order within days in Sierra Leone , where an army coup has overthrown the civilian government , a senior French defence ministry official said on Thursday . 
&quot; You surely must be aware that Nigerian troops are arriving in force in Freetown and one can estimate order will be restored there in the coming days , &quot; the officer told a press briefing . 
Nigeria has made no public statement on Sunday &apos;s coup but officials said it was trying to negotiate a peaceful restoration of civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah . 
the French officer was answering questions about the safety of some 100 French nationals in Sierre Leone who have been urged to leave the country by their government . 
he said an agreement was reached with the United States that the French would be evacuated by American troops if the need arose . 
the U.S. Navy helicopter ship Kearsarge , presumably with Marine units aboard , was off Sierra Leone &apos;s coast ready to evacuate U.S. and other foreigners from the troubled West African state .
