United Nations economists said on Thursday that world growth had stalled and warned that anti- inflationary policies in richer countries could spark popular reaction against open trade and a return to protectionism . 
the U.N. &apos; s Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , in its annual survey of the global scene , also found that while leading emerging economies in Asia were still growing rapidly they faced a mounting challenge from lower-wage countries . 
&quot; The slowing down of growth in the world economy is likely to continue during the remainder of 1996 , &quot; UNCTAD &apos;s Trade and Development Report said . 
the overall growth rate for the current year would not exceed the 2.4 per cent in 1995 , already a drop from 1994 &apos;s 2.8 per cent that was scored as the global economy was emerging from three years of recession . 
UNCTAD suggested that policies pursued in the drive among major members of the European Union to meet conditions for economic and monetary union ( EMU ) were partly responsible for the loss of steam . 
the commitment to reach the targets for the launch of a single European currency in 1999 , while fostering growth and employment , &quot; presents a daunting challenge , &quot; it said . 
&quot; The budget cuts undertaken to meet the ( EMU ) convergence conditions .... are exerting downward pressure on the growth of output , and therefore on the very budget receipts needed to meet the fiscal targets . 
there was , it added , &quot; scope for further monetary relaxation on pursuit of the twin goals of convergence and growth . 
while noting that the United States and Britain had been able to combine wage and price stability with falling unemployment , the report said there was a real risk of deflation in most developed economies if monetary policy continued to focus on fighting inflation and governments on cutting budgets . 
the U.S. experience of maintaining growth , in the face of assertions that the economy was overheating , &quot; confirms that fears of inflation have been exaggerated , &quot; it declared . 
in Europe , it said , there was a risk that job losses and lower real wages , especially in low-skill occupations , would be blamed on imports as well as on the drive towards EMU . 
&quot; High unemployment thus risks increasing resistance to policies directed toward achieving important objectives -- monetary union in Europe and the full integration , through trade , of developing countries in the world economy , &quot; it added . 
&quot; The bright point in the short-term outlook is the continued resilience of developing countries to external shocks , including the stagnation in a number of industrialised economies , and their ability to maintain recent trends in the growth of both their output and their trade . 
these economies were less dependent on trade with the North &quot; because successful industrialisation in the South has opened up new opportunities for South-South investment and trade . 
but , it added , &quot; the current outlook is not all rosy &quot; . 
in several East and South-East Asian countries export growth seemed to be faltering , partly due to the emergence of new competitors . 
serious balance-of-payments deficits difficulties could arise &quot; if competition from low-wage countries draws foreign investment away from South-East Asia , &quot; UNCTAD warned . 
Africa , the report said , was expected to return growth of 3.1 per cent this year , its highest of the decade -- partly due to a boom in export earnings from higher commodity prices and partly to greater political stability in many countries . 
but the region would need to sustain faster growth for some time to bring per capita incomes to their level of 20 years ago . 
Latin America , slowly recovering from the effects of the Mexican financial crisis at the end of 1994 , appeared set for some recovery in 1996 with output likely to be up 2.4 per cent after a fall of 0.7 per cent in 1995 . 
&quot; For most countries in the region , the challenge in the period ahead is to sustain rapid growth while consolidating recent significant progress in the fight against inflation and limiting external balances , &quot; UNCTAD said .
