Sparta Prague midfielder Martin Frydek &apos;s transfer to Germany &apos;s Bayern Leverkusen was clouded in confusion on Tuesday when Sparta officials denied the move had been finalised . 
last week the two teams appeared to reach an agreement . 
but Czech international Frydek said on Tuesday that the chances of his moving to the German club had dimmed greatly after Sparta &apos;s Slovak-led management team said two signatures of board members were needed for the transfer to be approved . 
right now , I see my chances at leaving for Leverkusen at about 50-50 , &quot; Frydek was quoted as saying in the daily Sport . 
Frydek &apos;s agent Zdenek Nehoda said he was shown a signed contract between Bayern Leverkusen and Sparta , signed by its general manager Gejza Sestak and his German counterpart . 
Sparta President Milan Valasik , however , told Sport that under a club directive two board members must sign agreements concerning player transfers . 
&quot; Sestak , of course , has the right to sign but his signature alone is not enough , &quot; Valasik said . 
&quot; My personal opinion is that the amount Leverkusen is offering is inadequate .
