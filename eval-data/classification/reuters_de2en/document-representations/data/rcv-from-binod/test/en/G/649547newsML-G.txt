first Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais earned seven times as much as President Boris Yeltsin in 1996 , his revenue boosted by lecture fees and profits on trading in securities , Interfax news agency said on Tuesday . 
chief reformer Chubais earned 39.6 million roubles ( worth about $ 7,000 at the end of the year ) from his public duties as a first deputy prime minister and as Yeltsin &apos;s chief of staff , Interfax quoted his spokesman Andrei Trapeznikov as saying . 
but Chubais , a hate figure for the opposition , earned 1.68 billion roubles ( $ 300,000 ) from securities transactions , speaking fees and other engagements earned when he held no official post . 
Chubais was sacked from the government in January 1996 , but after his successful work in Yeltsin &apos;s re-election campaign he was appointed Kremlin chief of staff in July 1996 and then First Deputy Prime Minister in March . 
Yeltsin &apos;s 1996 income , declared last month in line with a massive drive against official corruption , was just $ 42,000 . 
Trapeznikov said Chubais , who paid taxes of 527 million roubles ( $ 92,000 ) on last year &apos;s earnings , had sent his income figures to the local tax service . 
the average monthly pay in Russia is around $ 145 . 
reports about Chubais &apos;s wealth have outraged deputies at the State Duma ( lower house of parliament ) , which is dominated by communists . 
but Russian media say the authorities have found no evidence that he did anything wrong . 
Trapeznikov also said Chubais owned a two-room flat in Moscow , a plot of land in the country and a Suzuki off-road vehicle . 
the only securities the family owned were 20 shares in an investment fund , received in exchange for vouchers distributed to Russians in the privatisation campaign Chubais lauched in 1992 .
