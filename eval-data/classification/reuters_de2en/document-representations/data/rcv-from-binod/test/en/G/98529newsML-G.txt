Mexicans began voting on Sunday in the troubled southwestern state of Guerrero amid fear of violence in local contests between a strongarm government and an increasingly angry opposition . 
watching the vote from a distance were thousands of army troops and rebels of the Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) , a group which first appeared in this state and may use the vote as a litmus test of a government it considers illegitimate . 
across Mexico , the election is being closely watched following a wave of violence between local members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) and a mostly leftist opposition . 
army troops suspended counter-insurgency operations in search of EPR rebels over the weekend and were ordered to remain in their barracks during the vote to elect 76 new mayors across the state and a new state congress . 
tensions ran high following allegations this week of vote buying and other dirty tricks by the long-ruling pri -- causing some to question Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s ability to force the local pri political machinery to hold a clean vote . 
human rights groups said they feared many voters would stay at home following a massive mobilisation of army troops during the summer to search for the EPR after a series of deadly attacks on police and army stations . 
although the army was temporarily gone from view , state police armed with automatic rifles and wearing bullet-proof vests roamed the streets in convoys early on Sunday . 
the pri was expected to win nearly all the races , including the state capital Chilpancingo and the posh tourist resort of Acapulco , despite an economic crisis and a series of political scandals that have cost it support across Mexico . 
the pri , which has ruled Mexico for 67 consecutive years , has overwhelming political power in the state , controlling 68 of the 76 town halls . 
the main opposition is the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) , which runs six towns . 
pri banners , swathed in the colours of the Mexican flag , festooned the streets of Chilpancingo over the weekend . 
the advertisements reminded voters of the EPR &apos;s deadly tactics in the state by featuring a giant dove next to the slogan : &quot; Vote for peace , vote for unity . 
the pri has also used the local press to its advantage . 
a leading local newspaper on Saturday ran two front-page stories , one accusing the PRD of breaking electoral law by distributing flyers two days before the poll and the other praising acting pri Gov. 
Angel Aguirre for acting to make Chilpancingo &quot; a better city for all . 
Guerrero is one of Mexico &apos;s poorest states , where half the workers earn less than four dollars a day and nearly a third of the population is illiterate . 
it also has a history of violence . 
human rights groups say 120 people were murdered in Guerrero during the past year alone for political reasons -- more than during the previous three years combined . 
during state elections in 1989 , 20 people died in post-electoral clashes between leftists and state police . 
little trouble was expected in Acapulco or Chilpancingo , which lies some 300 kms ( 180 miles ) south of Mexico City . 
but observers feared violence in more remote towns . 
one of those , the hamlet of Aguas Blancas , was sure to be a focus of attention . 
in June , 1995 , state police massacred 17 leftist peasants in Aguas Blancas , 60 kms ( 38 miles ) from Acapulco .
