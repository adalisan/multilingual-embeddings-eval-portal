American 200 metres champion Jon Drummond professed himself baffled on Wednesday after former world champion Frankie Fredericks set the fastest qualifying time of 20.13 seconds in the world quarter-finals . 
Drummond , who was almost eliminated in the morning &apos;s first round when he lost his balance and narrowly avoided stepping into an adjoining lane , qualified in third place in 20.59 seconds behind Fredericks and ATO Boldon . 
&quot; Well , Frankie certainly sent a message to the rest of us with that run , &quot; Drummond said . 
why waste all that energy at this stage of the game , what was that all about ? 
Boldon , who bombed in the 100 final on Sunday after his early round form suggested he would destroy the opposition , clocked 20.28 and said : &quot; Nothing is going to make up for the disappointment of what happened in the 100 , but I &apos;m still going out to win this . 
in the women &apos;s 200 , Susanthika Jayasinghe added her own contribution to a significant day of sporting achievement for Sri Lanka , by clocking the second fastest qualifying time in the quarter-finals . 
one the day that her country &apos;s cricketers set 
a record test score in a test match , Jayasinghe made people sit up and take notice of her 22.47 second run which guaranteed her a place in the semifinals on Wednesday . 
only Melinda Gainsford of Australia with 22.45 ran faster . 
gold medal favourite Marie Jose Perec of France also coasted into the last 16 with a time of 22.69 running into a headwind and said afterwards she was happy with her performance . 
&quot; It was much better than the way I ran in the opening round this morning , &quot; said the double Olympic champion . 
&quot; There was a very strong headwind , but it didn &apos;t really bother me . 
Merlene Ottey , bidding for her third successive world 200 title also came through effortlessly , winning the opening heat in 22.65 seconds . 
Ottey , whose hopes in the 100 were effectively dashed when she sprinted 60 metres after failing to hear the recall gun following a false start , said : &quot; This is nothing to get excited about , anything can happen in athletics . 
there are two more rounds to go yet .
