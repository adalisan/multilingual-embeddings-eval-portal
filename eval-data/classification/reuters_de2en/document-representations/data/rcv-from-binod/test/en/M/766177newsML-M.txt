Argentine stocks were expected to open narrowly higher Wednesday as the market continues to consolidate recent gains , dealers said . 
&quot; The Bolsa has probably already topped out this week , so prices are likely to drift in yesterday &apos;s ranges , &quot; said Jorge Bonanno at traders Interfin . 
blue chips erased early gains Tuesday and dipped to 849.02 on the MerVal index .MERV against a session high of 859 . 
they had rallied 7.8 percent in the previous five sessions , recouping most of the losses incurred earlier this month on devaluation fears in Brazil . 
&quot; The market looks very firm , and several blue chips stocks keep pushing higher , &quot; an analyst at an emerging markets brokerage said . 
&quot; Although I don &apos;t see much short-term upside potential , the market will try to test new five-year highs . 
the MerVal closed at a five-year ceiling of 850 three weeks ago and reached an intra-session high of 859.17 . 
traders noted U.S. markets were rallying Wednesday on the back of a budget deal in Washington and a rosy interest rate outlook , with long bond yields falling to 6.32 percent , their lowest level since March 1996 . 
however , some jitters were likely to surface ahead of the U.S. non-farm payrolls announcement Friday , dealers said .
