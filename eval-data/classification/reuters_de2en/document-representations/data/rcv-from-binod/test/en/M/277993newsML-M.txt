CBOT rice futures closed firm after new contract highs were set with the market underpinned by firm cash markets , especially for high grade rice , traders said . 
traders said the high grade Jasmine rice in the Thai market moved from $ 525.00 up to over $ 600.00 per ton and there continues to be good demand in China for high quality rice . 
but gains were limited because the market was becoming overbought technically and also there were sell orders at and just above the current price levels . 
&quot; The market is overbought and there is a lot of selling over the market , &quot; a trader said . 
the new high for January was $ 11.23 per cwt , above the previous high of $ 11.15 set Thursday . 
rice futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 600 contracts , below the 826 contracts traded Thursday . 
rice closed one to three cents per cwt higher , with January up one at $ 11.16 per cwt .
