Australian wool prices are expected to be erratic this week , pastoral group Wesfarmers Dalgety Ltd said in its weekly market preview . 
the eastern market indicator last week fell four cents to 566 cents a kg clean while the western market indicator fell five cents to 527 cents a kg clean for the week . 
sales this week are in Goulburn , Melbourne and Fremantle with 103,000 bales rostered . 
the Australian Council of wool Exporters said rostered sales averaging over 100,000 bales for the next few weeks will continue to provide a severe test for the market . 
a slightly weaker Australian dollar , pressure to meet Chinese shipment dates before Christmas , the near completion of wool International &apos;s December sales quota , and recognition that these prices are at historically low levels are all helping to stimulate buying and giving strength to these prices , it said . 
not all these factors apply to the fine wool market , the report added . 
&quot; Large quantities of these wools are available through until Christmas and European demand remains sluggish , indicating further erratic price activity for this end of the market , &quot; Wesfarmers Dalgety said .
