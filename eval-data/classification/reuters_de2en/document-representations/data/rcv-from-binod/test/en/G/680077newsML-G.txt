Hong Kong passed a law on Monday stripping the immigration privileges of British citizens in the territory before it reverts to Chinese rule in eight days . 
Hong Kong lawmakers overwhelmingly backed the move by the government to bring the British passport holders in line with other foreign nationals . 
the new law is expected to take effect immediately . 
Britons previously had not needed a visa to work and live in Hong Kong if they had resided in the territory for at least seven years . 
the British territory of Hong Kong reverts to Beijing &apos;s control at midnight on June 30 , ending 156 years of colonial rule . 
in April , Britons were stripped of their visa-free rights to reside and work in Hong Kong , while British tourists got their 12-month visa-free visitors &apos; stay period halved . 
Britons are now required to obtain a work permit , just like any other foreign national . 
wealthy low-tax Hong Kong has proved a magnet for young Britons in recent years who now form an army of casual workers , delivering sandwiches , pulling beers and teaching English . 
many of them stop off for a few months at a time to replenish their bank balances before backpacking around Asia .
