the World Bank &apos;s chief of mission in China has said he expects China &apos;s strong economic growth to exceed forecasts for this year , but warned of the need to accelerate reform of lumbering state firms and to create more jobs . 
&quot; The macro economic situation at this point is very very strong , as inflation has gone down to well below six percent and the economy has been growing at a high but sustainable level , &quot; Pieter Bottelier said in an interview with the official Xinhua news agency . 
measures taken in the last three years to rein in the economy have been effective and Beijing &apos;s moderately tight fiscal and monetary policies have produced the desired results , resulting in a successful soft landing for the economy last year , he said . 
China &apos;s economy was expected to improve further this year with major economic indicators very likely to be better than expected , Bottelier said . 
China &apos;s economy has grown by about 10 percent a year for several years and was expected to show similar growth in 1997 despite an official goal of about 8.0 percent , officials have said . 
in addition , Beijing has brought retail price inflation under control , cutting the rate to 6.1 percent last year , down from 14.8 percent in 1995 and a Communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994 . 
China &apos;s inflation goal for 1997 is six percent but the figure for the year is expected to be much lower . 
however , Bottelier warned of several problems , saying China needed to improve its fiscal situation , accelerate the pace to reform of lumbering state-owned enterprises and the process of commercialising its state-owned banks . 
China has been reluctant to leave state firms to sink or swim in a market economy , fearing a stream of bankruptcies and mass unemployment that could spark social unrest . 
banking reform has also been hampered by the high level of bad debts extended to the state firms . 
Beijing also needed to create more jobs to guarantee healthy and long-term economic development , Bottelier said . 
Chinese leaders fear rising unemployment could result in social unrest and protests similar to the student-led demonstrations of 1989 that were suppressed by the army with heavy loss of life . 
in terms of the World Bank &apos;s role in China , Bottelier said the bank was committed to its projects in China . 
&quot; It &apos;s ... our intention to broaden the range of financial instruments available to support China &apos;s development , &quot; he was quoted as saying . 
since China resumed World Bank membership in May 1980 , it has become the single largest client of the bank with annual borrowings standing at between $ 2.5 and $ 3.0 billion . 
the bank has lent a total of more than $ 26.8 billion to 180 projects in China and its lending arm for cheap loans , the International Development Association , plans to arrange more co-financing and cross-financing for China , Bottelier said . 
&quot; The World Bank &apos;s relationship with China is very effective and we think it is important that the World Bank continues to support social development and poverty elimination in China , &quot; he said .
