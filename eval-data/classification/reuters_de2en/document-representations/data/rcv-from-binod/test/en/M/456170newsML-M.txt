tight ranges and thin volumes characterised trading activity in SIMEX Euroyen and Eurodollar futures on Thursday as participation was severely hampered by the absence of Japanese players on a holiday . 
dealers said the Japanese and U.S. interest rate futures remained under pressure on concerns about the interest rate outlook in both countries . 
volume was a paltry 2,945 lots . 
&quot; The 99.05 level is a good level to go long , &quot; said a trader with a U.S. house , adding however , any upside was likely to be capped around 99.10 / 12 ahead of the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) &apos; s quarterly business sentiment survey on April 2 . 
a BOJ official &apos;s comments earlier in the week Japan &apos;s low long-term rates do not always reflect economic fundamentals triggered fears Japan might end its easy monetary policy , dealers said . 
Eurodollar futures finished slightly lower with the September contract at 93.865 against its IMM close at 93.870 on volume of 4,700 lots . 
dealers said the market was not likely to pay much heed to U.S. trade data , due at 1330 GMT , as anticipation of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next Tuesday gradually began to eclipse all other factors . 
comments by Fed officials and recent signs of growing economic strength have fuelled fears of an interest rate hike . 
Japanese government bond futures were not traded due to the holiday in Japan .
