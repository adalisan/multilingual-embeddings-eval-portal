dark northern spring wheat prices were higher on Wednesday as MGE spring wheat futures surged and merchants expected farmer selling to pick up . 
&quot; We rallied the board like crazy today and I think it probably will start to bring a little wheat out of the country , &quot; a Minneapolis-based merchant said . 
&quot; These are prices that attracted some selling interest last time around . 
he added farmers would likely wait to see Thursday &apos;s opening calls before deciding whether to sell . 
a lower call would likely prompt some movement as farmers tried to beat the selloff , he said . 
MGE December spring wheat futures closed at $ 4.17 per bushel , up 16-1 / 2 cents from Tuesday &apos;s close and the highest close since October 15 . 
but basis levels dropped in parts of North Dakota and Montana in response to compensate for the higher futures values . 
dealers cited a lack of demand . 
&quot; I just don &apos;t think we need the wheat , &quot; one Montana dealer said . 
&quot; There &apos;s really nobody in the market for it .
