Hong Kong on Wednesday moved to deport hundreds of children claiming right of abode in the territory , passing a law that retroactively sets up rules regarding their entry from China . 
the Provisional Legislature passed the law by a 45 to six vote , heeding warnings that legislation was needed immediately to curb a potential flood of smuggled children , even though police said there were no signs of such a surge . 
over 400 children have been surrendered to authorities in Hong Kong since the territory &apos;s reversion to China on July 1 . 
they were smuggled into the territory illegally or overstayed their visas , but are now claiming the right to remain here under the Basic Law , Hong Kong &apos;s post-handover constitution , because their parents are legal residents here . 
the new law requires them to get a &quot; certificate of eligibility &quot; before entering Hong Kong and makes the requirement retroactive so that the children already here can be deported , whether or not they theoretically have the right to remain here . 
the retroactive nature of the law has drawn condemnation from human rights groups . 
&quot; Such an abrogation of these children &apos;s rights is particularly serious because it sets a precedent ... of denying by administrative measures the constitutional rights of the Hong Kong people , &quot; a Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor statement said . 
but Secretary for Security Peter Lai denied the law was unconstitutional . 
&quot; The law enacted today does not infringe the right of abode of the mainland children of Hong Kong parents . 
it only makes them come here in orderly fashion , &quot; he told reporters after the law was passed . 
lawyers have warned the law was likely to be challenged in court , and local media reported the first writ by a parent of a girl who had overstayed her visa was filed on Wednesday . 
Lai said the law was needed to prevent a flood of smuggled children jumping the queue . 
Director of Operations ng Ching-kwok told reporters that overall arrests of illegal migrants in the first half of 1997 were down 18 percent from the same period last year . 
interviews with recently surrendered child illegal migrants found most had entered Hong Kong before this year , he added . 
&quot; These trends and figures show there has not been a massive influx of illegal immigrants , both adults and minor children , coming into Hong Kong as a result of the transition , &quot; ng said .
