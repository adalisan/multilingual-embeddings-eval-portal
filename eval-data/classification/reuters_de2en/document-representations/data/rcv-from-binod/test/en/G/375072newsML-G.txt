Boris Yeltsin , keeping up a steady workload as he recovers from pneumonia , met Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov in the Kremlin on Thursday as his political foes prepared a fresh attack . 
Kulikov said Yeltsin , who is still convalescing from his illness at a country residence outside Moscow , was in &quot; good working form &quot; during their 40-minute meeting . 
brief television footage showed a dark-suited Yeltsin , looking thin but smiling and moving easily , greeting the uniformed Kulikov at his Kremlin office . 
the State Duma lower house of parliament , which is dominated by communists and nationalists , is due to discuss a resolution on Friday calling on Yeltsin to quit on health grounds . 
the resolution has no legal force and Yeltsin &apos;s representative in the Duma , Alexander Kotenkov , said it would have &quot; no consequences except political scandal &quot; . 
but the move keeps Yeltsin on the defensive , forcing him to prove that he can still run the country despite health problems . 
efforts to crack down on crime will be part of his strategy and Interfax news agency quoted Kulikov as saying Yeltsin had given him &quot; carte blanche &quot; to deal with economic crime , which costs Russia &apos;s state coffers billions of dollars every year . 
the two men also discussed measures to improve the work of the Interior Ministry , the customs service and the tax police . 
&quot; The main thing , in the president &apos;s view , is strengthening fiscal and customs discipline with decisive actions , &quot; the Kremlin press service said in a statement after the meeting . 
underlining the scale of the task ahead , Yegor Stroyev , chairman of the upper house Federation Council , told NTV commercial television that Russia &apos;s reform programme would fail if it failed to weed out corruption . 
State Prosecutor Yuri Skuratov said economic crime threatened to spiral out of control and a strong political will was needed to combat it . 
the government often blames tax dodgers -- companies and individuals -- for chronic delays in paying wages and pensions . 
Yeltsin &apos;s press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told Interfax that pensions would be a major topic of a radio address Yeltsin plans to make to the nation on Friday , 
he said Yeltsin was angry at suggestions made recently by the head of the Russian Pension Fund , Vassily Barchuk , that working pensioners could forfeit their right to a pension . 
Yeltsin &apos;s radio address , to be broadcast at 11 a.m. ( 0800 GMT ) , will also touch on Moscow &apos;s relations with breakaway Chechnya and on the possibility of constitutional reform , Yastrzhembsky added . 
former rebel guerrilla leader Aslan Maskhadov formally took office as Chechnya &apos;s first post-war president on Wednesday , vowing to pursue his aim of full independence from Moscow . 
Russian news agencies said Maskhadov started forming a governent on Thursday . 
Moscow , whose military bid to quash the rebels ended in humiliation , still hopes to use economic inducements to persuade Chechnya to remain within the Russian Federation . 
Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin would also reply to critics in the State Duma lower house of parliament who want to water down his presidential powers . 
&quot; ( The critics ) must learn to work with the constitution , &quot; he quoted the president as saying . 
Yegor Stroyev , chairman of Russia &apos;s upper house Federation Council , said on Thursday Yeltsin would make his annual address to both chambers of parliament on March 5 . 
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said this week that Yeltsin &apos;s performance before deputies , along with a planned summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton later in March , would reveal his real ability to rule Russia .
