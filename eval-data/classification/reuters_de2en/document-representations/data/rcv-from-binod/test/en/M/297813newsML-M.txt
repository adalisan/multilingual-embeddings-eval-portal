the Australian dollar finished at five month lows Thursday as offshore investors dumped the currency in reaction to a domestic rate cut scare . 
all the one cent of losses came late Wednesday as rumours of an impending easing , although largely hosed down by the Reserve Bank , proved hot enough to spark heavy selling from U.S. and Japanese funds . 
exporter bids and a weakening yen helped hold the line at 78 cents for the local session , but dealers said bearish technical omens and depressed sentiment favoured a test of US $ 0.7765 soon . 
&quot; The close below US $ 0.7810 has important medium term implications confirming a sustainable down-trend is under way , &quot; said Clifford Bennett , a technical trader at BNP Australia . 
&quot; We are on the verge of confirming a move toward US $ 0.7650 . 
that was still a shade above its offshore low of US $ 0.7777 and analysts had not totally written it off as yet , although they emphasied that bulls would have to recover US $ 0.7850 soon to forestall self-perpetuating selloff . 
immediate support was put at US $ 0.7765 and US $ 0.7720 but analysts were tipping a test of the US $ 0.7680 low reached in the wake of the Reserve Bank &apos;s first rate cut on July 31 . 
it was speculation of a fourth easing that brought the dollar to its current pass , with the market all tensed up for a cut this morning despite Wedensday &apos;s unusual move by the Reserve Bank to quash talk of an immediate move . 
most analysts here reckoned the RBA would wait at least until its next board meeting on February 4 before deciding , and some were not sure it would ease then given that cuts in November and December had hardly had time to feed through . 
that reasoning held little water with the money market , however , where 90-day bank bill futures had surged 16 basis points this week to 93.31 , implying a rate of 5.69 percent against the present official cash rate of 6.00 percent . 
dealers said there were concerns another cut would put an end to the Japanese love affair with A $ paper which had been such a feature of 1996 . 
this was not entirely dead as shown by the successful launch of a 30 billion yen / A $ dual currency samurai for the New South Wales Treasury Corp today , they said . 
furthermore , another big drop in Tokyo stocks promised to keep rates there at record lows for some time to come . 
all this helped keep the dollar steady at 90.68 / 78 yen from 90.70 / 80 late Wednesday and might just prevent its slide on the US $ deteriorating into a long term rout . 
in trade weighted terms the currency finished at 58.3 , down from a previous 58.6 close .
