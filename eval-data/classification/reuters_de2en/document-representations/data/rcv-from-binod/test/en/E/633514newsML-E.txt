the Cairns Group of 15 agricultural exporting countries will hold its annual ministerial meeting on June 5-6 in Rio de Janeiro to prepare the ground for the next set of world trade talks , officials said . 
under the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) Agriculture Agreement , further multilateral negotiations on agriculture are to begin by the end of 1999 which Group members hope will result in greater liberalisation of world farm trade . 
&quot; The main objective is to plan for the events occurring over the next two years , &quot; said Jose Graca Lima , head of the economics department at Brazil &apos;s Foreign Ministry . 
&quot; We aim to find a line of action that will deeepen the process of liberalisation , better said , reform , of agriculture , &quot; he added . 
this week &apos;s meeting will concentrate on &quot; analysis and exchange of information that will lead to the next round of negotiations on agriculture , &quot; said Nestor Osorio , Colombia &apos;s ambassador to the WTO and Cairns Group member . 
the main goal of the Group is the &quot; elimination of subsidies and all measures which are market distortions &quot; , added Osorio who is also the current chairman of the WTO &apos;s Committee on Agriculture . 
as well as looking ahead to 1999 , Group members will assess the results of the Uruguay Round global trade talks completed in 1994 . 
the Group was largely responsible for the creation of a framework for farm trade reform in the Round . 
&quot; We are at a mid-point , &quot; said Charles Mott , Australia &apos;s ambassador to Brazil . 
&quot; It is a bit early to speculate on the nature of the strategy for going forward ... But the Group has always worked for greater liberalisation of trade in agriculture , &quot; he added . 
one of the Group &apos;s main concerns is the high level of subsidies in the European Union ( EU ) , officials said . 
at the first WTO ministerial conference in December last year , the EU battled with the US and Cairns Group countries over the wording of a statement on agriculture which some saw as a rehearsal for the even tougher bargaining expected in 1999 . 
formed in 1986 , the Cairns Group operates under Australian leadership on an informal basis without disciplinary procedures or strict rules and takes a consensual approach to decision-making . 
its members range from Thailand to Uruguay and account for about 20 percent of the world &apos;s agricultural exports . 
the Rio de Janeiro meeting will be the first in which Paraguay participates as a full member , officials said .
