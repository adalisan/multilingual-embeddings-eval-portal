Poland &apos;s nearly 10 percentage point gap between year-on-year producer and consumer prices in October is the result of the zloty &apos;s real-term appreciation and the lack of competition in the services sector , analysts said . 
on Tuesday the Central Statistical Office ( Gus ) said producer prices ( PPI ) rose 0.8 percent in October and fell to year-on-year 9.8 percent , from 10.1 percent in September and 18.9 percent at the end of last year . 
year-on-year consumer price growth ( CPI ) was 19.5 percent last month , down from 21.6 percent in December 1995 . 
&quot; The gap between producer and consumer prices can be attributed mainly to the real-term appreciation of the zloty over the last year , &quot; Adam Czyzewski , economist at the independent NOBE think-tank told Reuters . 
the zloty rose by about 10 percent in real-terms in 1995 and is on course for a six percent appreciation this year . 
analysts said the rise of the zloty boosted competitive imports , which forced slower producer price growth . 
it also lowered the costs of imported raw materials for production . 
analysts said the current large gap between PPI and CPI , which a year ago was only 1.6 percentage points , was also caused by the lack of competition in the services sector . 
&quot; Most service prices are not related to the zloty , whose rise against western currencies over the past year kept the prices of imports down , &quot; Czyzewski said . 
according to Gus , service prices are the fastest growing component of the CPI basket this year , having increased by 18.4 percent over the first 10 months of 1996 . 
analysts also said excessive middle-man costs in the underdeveloped Polish economy continued to keep retail prices high despite lower producer costs . 
&quot; middle-man costs may add as much as four percentage points to the year-on-year CPI index because of high-cost and often monopolistic activities , &quot; Tadeusz Chroscicki head analyst at the Planning Ministry ( Cup ) said . 
but analysts said slower PPI growth bode well for the government &apos;s ambitious inflation targets for next year as the lower figures would eventually drag down the consumer index . 
the government wants to curb inflation to 13 percent in year-on-year terms in December 1997 from an expected 18.7 percent in December 1996 . 
&quot; This is a good sign , it may mean that Poland will be more effective in stifiling inflation in 1997 , even if the 13 percent target is not met , &quot; said Cup &apos;s Chroscicki .
