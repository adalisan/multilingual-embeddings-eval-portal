world champions Brazil fought back from two goals down to beat understrength Mexico 3-2 in an enthralling COPA America match on Monday . 
a stunning left-foot strike by Leonardo 10 minutes from the end gave Brazil three points in a match that served up the best of Latin American football in what has been a generally lackluster tournament . 
Mexico , backed by a mariachi band in the stands , fielded only about half of their regular team , making up the rest of the side with younger players . 
but they performed heroically , matching the world champions for skill and commitment in the group C game , which ensured Brazil a place in the quarter-finals with six points from two games . 
Mexico have three and their fate will be decided Thursday . 
two first-half goals by striker Luis Hernandez put Mexico on top . 
but Brazil , highly prone to theatrics throughout the match , replied through Aldair and a superb Romario effort in the first 15 minutes of the second half . 
the match could have gone either way in the last half hour . 
Brazil goalkeeper Taffarel made a brilliant save with his feet to deny Cuahtemoc Blanco after a Mexican counter-attack , while at the other end Adolfio Rios denied Ronaldo and Romario with a brilliant double save . 
then , with 10 minutes left , Leonardo picked up the ball on the right of the Mexican area and beat Rios with a thumping drive from what appeared an almost impossible angle . 
Brazil still had to withstand intense Mexican pressure near the end with Hernandez missing two good chances from close range . 
Mexico have rested stars such as Carlos Hermosillo and Luis Garcia for World Cup qualifying matches . 
Brazil , who do not have to play the qualifiers as world champions , have brought all their top players . 
Brazil coach Mario Zagallo was of two minds over his squad &apos;s performance . 
&quot; The second half was a magnificent victory for art over strength . 
we produced great technique , everything the fan likes to see , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But we must never be as apathetic as we were in the first half . 
this was incomprehensible . 
Hernandez , who took his tally to four goals in two games , struck the first blow in the 14th minute when he rose above his marker to head in a cross from the right . 
in the 32nd minute , he beat a hesistant Celio Silva and Aldair to a through ball by Camilo Romero , turned and stuck the ball beyond Taffarel for Mexico &apos;s second goal . 
the goals unsettled Brazil , who were guilty of a number of crude tackles in the first half . 
Right-back Cafu should have been sent off for one he committed when he had already been booked , but the referee let him off with a severe warning . 
their strikers fell over almost every time they got near or in the penalty area , with Romario , Ronaldo and Denilson , who came on for Djalminha at halftime , the main culprits . 
the game changed dramatically two minutes into the second half after Aldair scored with a header . 
in the 62nd minute , Romario ran through the Mexican defence , decided this time to stay on his feet and was rewarded with a superb goal scored with his right foot . 
Brazil &apos;s Flavio Conceicao was sent off in the last minute for dissent after he was booked for time-wasting .
