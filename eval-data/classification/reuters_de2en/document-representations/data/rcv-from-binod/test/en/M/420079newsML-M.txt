NYMEX crude oil prices ended lower on Wednesday , having failed to hold gains made earlier in the day . 
benchmark light crude futures for April delivery hit a high of $ 20.89 a barrel during the regular session but slipped back to settle at $ 20.49 , down 17 cents on the day . 
&quot; Again the market failed to follow through on strength yesterday , &quot; said Ed Kevelson , a trader at Paribas futures in New York . 
&quot; Basically , the market said it didnt believe the numbers on crude , &quot; he added , referring data showing a heft draw on crude stocks last week .
