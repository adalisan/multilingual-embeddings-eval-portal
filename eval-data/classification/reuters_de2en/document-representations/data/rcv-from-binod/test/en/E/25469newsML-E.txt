Japan &apos;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) shares the view of the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) that Japan &apos;s economic recovery will not be without setbacks , a ministry official told a news conference on Friday . 
the MITI official also said that the ministry shares the view of the BOJ that the economy is still on a gradual recovery track . 
&quot; For those expecting the pace of economic recovery to accelerate with time , the current pace of recovery may seem a little weak . 
we share the view of the Bank of Japan that the economic recovery may not necessarily be without setbacks , &quot; she said . 
MITI announced earlier that Japan &apos;s industrial production for July rose a preliminary 4.1 percent from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis . 
it was the highest growth since September 1992 when the figure rose 4.2 percent month-on-month . 
the MITI official said stock levels remained high , but there were signs that they were starting to decline . 
however , she said the ministry still needed to keep watch to see whether the trend would continue . 
she attributed the rise in the July output figures to a rise in production of personal computers , mobile telephones and automobiles . 
looking ahead , the lower August forecast was due to an expected drop in production of cars as makers prepared to introduce new models as well as an anticipated drop in production of computers and mobile phones , the official said . 
she said summer holidays in Japan in August also contributed to the lower month on month forecast .
