Komercni Banka , one of the market &apos;s leading performers was hit by a round of profit-taking at the PSE daily price fixing , but managed to regain 10 crowns to close down 40 at 2,460 . 
meanwhile CEZ dipped early but came back strong to close up 15 crowns at 1,045 and dealers said the largest Czech utility had further growth potential . 
dealers noted that market sentiment on the whole appears to be slightly bullish as investors begin to regain their focus following the end of the summer holiday season .
