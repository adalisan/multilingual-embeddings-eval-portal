dollar / mark retained the bulk of Monday &apos;s rally as confusion among German authorities over their budget accounts and the new government in France fueled doubts about the timing and strength of the European single currency . 
the dollar is seen by many as a higher-yielding , safe-haven alternative to European units with an uncertain future . 
it ended the European session little changed from Monday &apos;s close but off overnight highs above 1.73 marks as euro tensions eased . 
&quot; If the German government and its central bank find it hard to agree with each other , then it &apos;s safer to stick your money in dollars , &quot; said Eddie Tofpik , trader at MeesPierson Derivatives . 
Tofpik said the same desire to park funds in safe-haven currencies deemed to be outside the uncertain euro area also underpinned the Swiss franc . 
at 1515 GMT , the dollar was trading at 1.7260 / 65 marks compared with 1.7265 / 75 late Monday . 
against the yen , it was at 116.00 / 10 compared with 116.55 / 65 . 
the dollar &apos;s rally Monday was fueled by the row between the Bundesbank and German government over the appropriateness of revaluing Germany &apos;s gold reserves as part of its budgetary accounting to meet EMU targets . 
the victory for the French socialists in Sunday &apos;s election added to talk of a soft euro . 
the argument for buying the dollar , which still yields almost one full percentage point over the mark on 10-year bonds , is that the French Socialist desire for a broader , less fiscally restrictive EMU and German difficulties meeting the EMU targets will lead to a softer euro than initially envisaged . 
&quot; A soft EMU with Italy in at the start is foremost in the market &apos;s mind , &quot; said Julian Jessop , economist at Nikko Europe . 
news from France and Germany today did little to alter this view . 
officials from the new French government inisted they favoured a punctual EMU start , while the German government reached a compromise with the Bundesbank over the gold issue . 
a meeting between German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer earlier flagged the compromise on the gold revaluation . 
the Bundesbank had objected to the move on the grounds it interfered with its independence . 
Waigel was seen to back down on initial proposals and said any transfer of funds would not now take place before 1998 . 
this is seen as making it more difficult for Germany to meet the EMU goals on time and , as a result , makes it more difficult for it to exclude other EMU hopefuls like Italy and Spain . 
the government , meantime , said it would still meet the euro targets on time for a punctual start in January 1999 
&quot; The bureaucratic juggernaut carrying EMU has picked up too much speed at this stage to stop in its tracks and the market now has to reserve judgement on its likely external value versus the dollar , &quot; said a senior trader at a U.S. Bank here . 
&quot; The bottom line is buy dollars , &quot; he said . 
the case for the dollar was strengthened further by expectations of a strong U.S. employment report for May when it is released on Friday . 
analysts polled by Reuters expect a 221,000 rise in non-farm payrolls during the month but estimates are rising and some economists are talking of 300,000 already . 
data out today had little impact . 
the April U.S. index of leading economic indicators fell 0.1 percent , compared to forecasts of an unchanged rate . 
but the March index was revised to show a rise of 0.2 percent from 0.1 percent originally . 
elsewhere , the Swedish crown posted strong gains against the mark after the Swedish government said it would not join EMU in 1999 but wanted to leave the door open for entry at a later date . 
analysts said the crown &apos;s gains were based on similar arguments to the dollar &apos;s because Sweden would now be seen apart from the EMU uncertainty for now at least .
