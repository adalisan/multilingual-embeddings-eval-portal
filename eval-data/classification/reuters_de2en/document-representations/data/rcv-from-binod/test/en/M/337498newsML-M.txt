Brazil &apos;s new Nasdaq-like over-the-counter Bolsa , the SOMA , has exceeded expectations by drawing more investors , brokers and company listings in its first two months than many predicted , a bourse official said . 
&quot; We had expected that it would take some two years to establish this market but we are already trading high volumes , &quot; said Romeu Pasquantonio , sales manager at Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange ( BVRJ ) . 
styled on the U.S. &apos; s Nasdaq , the Sociedade Operadora de Mercado de Acesso ( SOMA ) was created last November by local bourses , bank and company groups and BNDESPar , the investment wing of national development bank BNDES , to run a market for shares not yet qualified to trade on stock exchanges . 
in two months , market traded 271.03 million reais , or 6.4 million reais a day , on 5,537 transactions involving 36.9 billion shares . 
the SOMA , which began trading the shares of seven companies , now lists 15 firms , including Rio Grande do Sul state &apos;s telecom CRT , Sao Paulo state &apos;s gas company Comgas and its sewer and water firm Sabesp . 
Pasquantonio expects the number of firms listed on the new Bolsa to rise further because some 600 Brazilian companies are public but not traded on the country &apos;s stock exchanges . 
&quot; We have a lot to work on , &quot; he said . 
eighty brokerages are actively operating on the SOMA , including those owned by local banks Banco Pactual , Opportunity , Banco Icatu , Banco marka , Banco Tendencia , matrix and Indosuez as well as Indusval brokerage . 
he also said the SOMA is open to foreign investors through Annex Four rules .
