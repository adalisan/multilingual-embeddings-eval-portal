Swedish long debt yields rose and the curve steepened , led by a weaker U.S. market and comments by Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke indicating it was not appropriate to turn the interest rate screw . 
the 10-year bond yield rose six basis point to 6.58 percent and the curve steepened with the spread to the three-year bond yields increasing five basis points to 124 . 
but the crown was strong and dealers said domestic interests spoke in favour of a flatter curve . 
the crown firmed to 8.0497 to the dollar from 8.0597 late on Thursday and was stable against the mark at 4.2945 vs 4.2940 . 
&quot; The crown looks fairly strong and we recommend being long in crowns , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; There is good support on the downside , so we probably have to break throgh 4.28 against the mark before it really speeds up on the downside , &quot; the dealer added .
