the Bank of Israel said on Tuesday it would provide an official daily figure for the deviation of the shekel &apos;s representative and closing rates from the outer limit of the diagonal currency band . 
this follows the government &apos;s decision last week to change the exchange rate regime . 
the rate of incline of the band &apos;s lower limit was lowered to four percent while the upper limit was kept at six percent . 
the band itself was widened so that in a year the shekel will be able to fluctuate by 15 percent on either side of the mid-point . 
until now , the bank had published a figure showing the distance of the shekel from the mid-point . 
&quot; It should be stressed that the calculation is needed because due to the new moving band the distances between the edges of the band and the mid-point are not fixed as in the past but widen every day , &quot; the central bank said . 
&quot; Nevertheless , the basis for all calculations will continue to be the mid-point . 
the central bank added that as long as the representative rate of the shekel against the basket of currencies to which it is linked was below the mid-point the calculation would be made relative to the lower end of the band . 
the bank said that on Monday , when the basket &apos;s representative rate was 3.7155 , the deviation from the lower end of the band was 0.19 percent .
