new Zealand &apos;s second string recorded their biggest win of the tour with a 31-0 victory over Western Transvaal ( halftime 12-0 ) in atrocious conditions on Tuesday . 
more than 80 percent of the pitch was covered in standing water when the teams ran out after torrential rain and hail lashed the ground for two hours before kickoff . 
the warmup game had to be abandoned midway through the second half as the players were pelted by hail and the ground turned white . 
Western Transvaal captain , Eugene Hare , who holds the record number of appearances for the province , said afterwards : &quot; I have never seen conditions like this . 
the All Blacks responded superbly to the conditions and scored five tries -- all through their backs -- to put behind them the struggles they had in overcoming Boland and Western Province in their previous midweek matches . 
however , winger Jonah Lomu looks no nearer a return to the test team . 
he completed his second 80 minutes of the tour but frequently limped heavily on his left knee . 
the New Zealand tries came from Ofisa Tonu &apos;u , Matthew Cooper , Eric Rush , Alama Ieremia and Carlos Spencer .

Swart , 65th ) ; Wynand Lourens , Fanie Heymans , Tony Lincoln , Carl Bensch ; A.J.
