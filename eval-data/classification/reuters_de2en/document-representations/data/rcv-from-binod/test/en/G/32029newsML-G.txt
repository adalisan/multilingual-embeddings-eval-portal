the first time Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat shook hands , the gesture was so brief that photographers had to ask them to do it again . 
the scene on Wednesday was far less a spectacle than when the late Yitzhak Rabin became the first Israeli prime minister to shake Arafat &apos;s hand almost exactly three years ago . 
that one took place before a crowd of thousands and a live international television audience on the White House lawn in Washington . 
only a few journalists and officials witnessed the historic moment on Wednesday -- in a crowded conference room at the heavily guarded Israeli-Gaza border . 
cameras recorded the event for broadcast only later . 
the latest handshake with Arafat was a personal and political milestone for the 46-year-old right-wing Israeli leader who built his career on branding Arafat &apos;s Palestine Liberation Organisation a terrorist group . 
Israelis in the prime minister &apos;s entourage said he was extremely tense before the hour-long meeting . 
asked hours later how he felt shaking Arafat &apos;s hand , Netanyahu said : &quot; I &apos;m not dealing here in feelings . 
the first Netanyahu-Arafat handshake went by so quickly that photographers were unable to record it . 
they insisted on a repeat performance . 
the second handshake , the one recorded for posterity , lasted four seconds -- an unusually quick greeting for the ever-courteous Arafat , 67 , known for his big bear hugs and stubble-faced kisses . 
Netanyahu rose first , tentatively , as cameras rolled at the Israeli-Palestinian liaison office at the Erez crossing . 
Netanyahu was host of the meeting since it took place at a complex under Israeli army control . 
the Israeli leader buttoned his suit before extending a hand to Arafat who , having risen in tandem with the prime minister , reached across the negotiating table to grasp it . 
Arafat half-smiled while Netanyahu appeared to say something to him . 
Netanyahu , who took office on June 18 and had resisted meeting Arafat , maintained a serious demeanour . 
the news conference that followed the meeting also had its moments . 
at the end of the news conference , the two walked away rather than agree to another handshake for the bulk of the journalists who had missed the earlier ones . 
Palestinians , their pride hurt , objected when they realised before the news conference their leader &apos;s podium was much shorter than the one for Netanyahu and not bullet-proof . 
the Israelis brought in one the same size for Netanyahu . 
Arafat , normally punctilious about giving people titles , at one point slipped up , referring to the Israeli leader as &quot; Mr Bibi &quot; . 
Netanyahu &apos;s nickname is &quot; Bibi &quot; . 
Arafat caught himself and then referred to Netanyahu as &quot; His Excellency &quot; . 
Arafat looked extremely drawn and tired after almost a week of midnight sessions fretting over whether the meeting would take place . 
Netanyahu addressed Arafat , the president of the Palestinian Authority , as chairman , a reference to his leadership of the PLO . 
some aides to Arafat felt the Palestinian leader had been snubbed because Netanyahu , who arrived first , did not come out to the car to greet him . 
the meeting was called fewer than three hours before it took place and security was so disorganised that dozens of journalists were stuck at a security check unable to record the historic arrival of the two leaders . 
Netanyahu was the third Israeli prime minister to shake hands with Arafat after Rabin and Shimon Peres , who took over after Rabin &apos;s assassination by an Israeli Jew opposed to peace moves . 
Peres was ousted by Netanyahu in May .
