new Zealand Minister of Finance Bill birch said on Monday he expected the New Zealand dollar to fall further towards the end of 1997 . 
asked if he would be concerned if the New Zealand dollar fell any further , birch told Reuters in an interview : &quot; I expect we will see it come down . 
they ( the Reserve Bank of New Zealand ) are foreshadowing further easings towards the end of this year so you are likely to get a little more easing . 
birch said he was more comfortable with where the currency was today than where it was last week . 
the New Zealand dollar has fallen sharply in recent weeks after a period in which it has been perceived as over-valued . 
&quot; From the point of view of the mix between interest rates and exchange rates the rebalancing has been very positive , I think , in terms of long term growth , &quot; he said . 
birch said he believed an export-led recovery would give New Zealand a much longer growth cycle and that if rates were too low it could cause a speculative burst of investment which would put pressure on the economy . 
&quot; You don &apos;t want interest rates so low that you are going to cause a burst of investment that might be speculative or drive up tradesmens &apos; wages as house prices rise . 
that caused quite a lot of pressure on our economy last time round , &quot; he said . 
birch said he believed New Zealand exporters were in a strong position to bounce back quickly after the recent fall in the currency . 
&quot; They ( exporters ) have actually been through a couple of years of pretty hard times and they &apos;ve maintained thier export levels . 
they &apos;ve captured efficiencies during that period , &quot; birch said . 
birch earlier told a Trans-Tasman Business Circle luncheon that the New Zealand government would place an increased emphasis on improving access for its exporters to international markets . 
birch said he had spoken with Australian Treasurer , Peter Costello about Trans-Tasman taxation and approval required on investment between Australia and New Zealand . 
&quot; Most Australian businesses would say they were confident of getting approval to invest in New Zealand , or the other way around , but there is a pretty big cost in the delay for those approvals , &quot; birch said . 
the next step to improve this process was to discuss possible changes in the present arrangements with business , birch said .
