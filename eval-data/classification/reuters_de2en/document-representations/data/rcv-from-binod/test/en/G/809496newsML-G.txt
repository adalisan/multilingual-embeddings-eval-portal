Iraq will inform the Iranian embassy in Baghdad of its decision to allow visits by Iranians to Iraq &apos;s Shi &apos;ite Moslem shrines , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Tuesday . 
Baghdad radio said on Monday Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had decided to allow Iranian visits to the shrines , suspended since the start of the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war , to resume from September 4 . 
an Iranian official was quoted as saying earlier on Tuesday that Baghdad had not officially told Iran of its decision and that talks should be held between the two countries before the visits could start . 
&quot; We will inform the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Baghdad that what has been announced on August 18 , 1997 ... is an official decision and it is valid as from September 4 , 1997 , &quot; the Iraqi spokesman , quoted by Baghdad radio , said . 
he said talks between the two neighbouring countries on receiving Iranian visitors had started in 1990 but had reached no results . 
the spokesman said it was up to the Iranian government to allow its people to visit the shrines and Iraq would be &quot; ready to receive Iranaian citizens willing to visit Iraq &apos;s religious shrines as from September 4 , 1997 &quot; . 
Shi &apos;ites , who form the overwhelming majority of Iran &apos;s 60 million population , regard the shrines in Karbala and Najaf in southern Iraq as second only to Islam &apos;s holiest sites in Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia . 
Iranian visits to the shrines were halted at the start of the war in which nearly one million people from Iran and Iraq died . 
September 4 is the date Iraq says the war started in 1980 . 
Iran says it began on September 22 . 
&quot; We have not been informed officially and therefore we cannot take a specific stance . 
we are waiting for the Iraqi officials to communicate the matter to us , &quot; Iran &apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said in comments carried by the English-language Iran News . 
Iraq &apos;s most influential newspaper Babel urged Iran on Tuesday to react postively to the Iraqi decision by improving ties with Baghdad . 
&quot; We want the Iranian side to prove its goodwill and respond to Iraq &apos;s salute with a similar one , &quot; Babel , owned by Saddam &apos;s eldest son Uday , said in a frontpage editorial . 
it said the Iraqi move was &quot; another indication that Iraq is willing to prepare the ground for normalisation of ties and solution to all pending issues &quot; . 
Babel said in order to improve bilateral ties Tehran should free all Iraqi prisoners of war and return Iraqi aircraft sent to Iran in 1991 to escape attacks by allied forces during the Gulf War over Kuwait . 
Iraq says more than 20,000 Iraqis are still jailed in Iran . 
Tehran denies this and says Baghdad is still holding 5,000 to 10,000 Iranian prisoners . 
Baghdad says it has released all Iranian POWs except one .
