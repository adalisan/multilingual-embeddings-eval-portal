Prime Minister , John Howard , has questioned the motives of the Nothern Land Council in lodging last-minute land claims to beat a sunset clause in the Northern Territory Land Rights Act . 
Mr Howard &apos;s called the claims very divisive . 
they include parts of Gregory and Litchfield National Parks , areas of seabed , river beds and banks and land held by the Northern Territory Land Corporation . 
Mr Howard told a mining industry dinner in Canberra , the claims will harm the Territory economy and investment in the Territory . 
he says they are contrary to the desire of all sections of the community to move forwards towards reconciliation . 
emergency services say a van &apos;s exploded in North Ryde , in north Sydney , killing the driver and injuring two people in a nearby house . 
a fire brigade spokesman says the vehicle was a plumbers &apos; van carrying oxy-acetylene gas . 
the explosion occurred near the intersection of Donald and Blenhem streets in North Ryde this morning . 
an ambulance spokesman says the two injured people were taken to Royal North Shore Hospital for treatment . 
independent Federal MP , Pauline Hanson , says she totally disagrees with Liberal Senator Ross Lightfoot &apos;s claim that Aborigines , in their natural state , are the lowest colour on the spectrum of civilisation . 
miss Hanson says she &apos;s never denigrated indigenous Australians , and says no race in Australia is superior to any other . 
Senator Lightfoot was forced to apologise in Parliament after he made the claim on Wednesday . 
China &apos;s Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has left Cairns to end his Australian visit . 
Zhu Rongji said last night his visit had been beneficial , and there was a commitment to increase ties between the two countries . 
he followed in the footsteps of other world leaders who have visited Australia recently , and made a trip to the Great Barrier Reef . 
Zhu Ronghi was this morning farewelled by Federal Science Industry and Tourism Minister , John Moore , and the Queensland Premier , Rob Borbidge . 
Western Australian Premier Richard Court says tax reform in Australia must be addressed at the same time as the sharing of total Commonwealth tax revenues . 
Mr Court is in Melbourne for an address to the Securities Institute . 
he says over the last decade the States have been receiving a smaller and smaller percentage of total Commonwealth revenues , and this trend must be reversed . 
Mr Court says the Federal Government must be prepared to change the sharing of the total revenues collected . 
a lobby group for the elderly says the Federal Government &apos;s Aged Care Bill is a radical change in principle to to nursing home access . 
under the new bill , to be debated in parliament on Monday , access to nursing homes will be determined by a person &apos;s assets , rather than their need . 
the Chief Executive of the Over Fifties Focus Group , Jean Elder , says the bill will dramatically affect up to 42,000 elderly Australians . 
Ms Elder says the bill turns upside down the notion that people enter into nursing homes on the basis of need . 
the Federal Opposition &apos;s called on the Government to ratify a United Nations Convention which prohibits the use of mercenaries in international conflicts . 
the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs , Laurie Brereton , and Shadow Defence Minister arch Bevis , say recent events in Papua New Guinea highlight the need for global action against mercenaries . 
Mr Brereton says the Convention was adopted in 1989 , but only 16 countries have signed , and only 12 have ratified it . 
he says the government should take a leading role by supporting the Convention , and make clear its opposition to the employment of mercenaries . 
Australia already has domestic legislation prohibiting the use of mercenaries in Australia , and the Government is considering whether to sign up to the UN convention . 
Labor Senator , Kate Lundy , says restrictions placed on future childcare places by the Federal Government have prompted fears long waiting lists may re-emerge . 
Senator Lundy was speaking ahead of a childcare summit to be held at Parliament House today , to examine the impact on the industry of the last two budgets . 
she says many people are still unclear of the implications of the cuts and changes to funding by the Federal Government . 
Senator Lundy says the growth of private provision is a concern , but has a positive side because it has meant an increase in the number of vacancies , which brought waiting lists down . 
but she says waiting lists of up to two years could return , especially for babies . 
opposition Leader , Kim Beazley , says compensation could be paid , without prejudice , to indigenous people taken from their families under forced assimilation policies of the past . 
Mr Beazley was rebutting claims by the Prime Minister that a formal apology to indigenous Australians would have serious legal implications . 
Mr Beazley has told Sydney &apos;s Radio 2GB such a view is complete bunkum .
