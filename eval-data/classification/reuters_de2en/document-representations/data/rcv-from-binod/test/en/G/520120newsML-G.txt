cholera has killed at least 200 people in the past one month in Nigeria &apos;s southeastern Cross River state , the independent Guardian newspaper said on Friday . 
more than 30 people died in the same state last month from cholera , which health officials said at the time was caused by contamination of the source of water to the area . 
they said the recent outbreak , which had killed among others the traditional ruler of Ekpokpa village in Ikom local council , was caused by poor drinking water and food contamination . 
the state health commissioner Doctor Ayi Archibong said drugs had been despatched to the area and a health education campaign launched to teach the people how to improve sanitation . 
epidemics of this nature are common in rural areas of Nigeria where pipe-borne water and other facilities are not always available .
