the Air Force ordered a delay on Tuesday in the trial of its first female B-52 bomber while authorities review her request for an honourable discharge . 
Lt. Kelly Flinn , who is 26 and single , requested the discharge to avoid being court-martialed on charges including adultery . 
&quot; In order to provide the chain of command and ( Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall ) with an opportunity to review and give due consideration to this matter , the request to proceed to trial ... has been denied , &quot; the Air Force said in a statement . 
Maj. Joe LaMarca , an Air Force spokesman in Minot , said the request for an honourable discharge had made its way through the chain of command to the Pentagon , where it will be evaluated and forward to Widnall for a decision . 
he earlier declined to comment on how long the court martial would be delayed . 
meanwhile , a man who identified himself as Flinn &apos;s ex-lover said Tuesday she knew that his marriage was still intact when she slept with him , calling into question Flinn &apos;s version of the story . 
the comments , made by a caller to CNN &apos;s &quot; talk Back Live &quot; television programme and identified himself as Marc Zigo , jolted an otherwise sluggish day as reporters and officials waited for the Pentagon to decide whether to proceed with the trial . 
Flinn has been charged with several offences , including adultery , disobeying a direct order and lying during an investigation . 
the charges stem from her acknowledged affair with Zigo and from an alleged affair with an enlisted man . 
she had dinner with myself and my wife and friends while I was in Minot , North Dakota ... She was well aware of the marriage . 
&quot; Zigo said , explaining that he was calling to air his side of the story . 
&quot; My intentions are not to ruin her reputation . 
my intention is to tell the truth , &quot; he said in the telephone interview . 
Flinn has said in recent interviews that Zigo lied to her about his marriage when the two had an affair , telling her that he had legally separated from his wife . 
Flinn &apos;s civilian lawyer Frank Spinner spoke to reporters shortly after Zigo &apos;s comments and said he was ready to question Zigo . 
&quot; When it comes to Mr. Zigo , he &apos;s going to say all kinds of things and we have plenty of ammunition for cross-examination , &quot; Spinner said , adding that he was hoping to interview Zigo on Wednesday . 
&quot; I expected to be in front of the judge this morning trying to argue for a delay and I was surprised , &quot; Spinner said . 
&quot; My guess is this particular resignation is probably going through the chain of command faster than any resignation in the history of the Air Force . 
dozens of journalists shuffled around a large , windowless room at Minot Air Force Base as officials waited for word from Washington on whether to move forward with Flinn &apos;s trial . 
Flinn &apos;s lawyers argued she was being unfairly persecuted for something commonplace in civilian life . 
but Air Force officials said the matter boiled down to broader violations of the code of conduct , including disobeying orders and lying during an official investigation . 
in Washington , Senate Republican leader Trent Lott said on Tuesday he believed Flinn was being &quot; badly abused &quot; by the Air Force and pledged to take the issue up with Defence Secretary William Cohen if the case moves ahead . 
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why she is being singled out and punished the way she is . 
I think at a minium she ought to get an honourable discharge , &quot; the Mississippi Republican said . 
calling the Pentagon &quot; not in touch with reality , &quot; Lott said that if Flinn &apos;s case does not turn out &quot; better than it looks like it &apos;s going to be worked out , I am going to take it up with him ( Defense Secretary Cohen ) because I think she has been badly abused . 
unnamed Pentagon officials said Monday that Flinn was unlikely to receive an honourable discharge from the Air Force . 
conviction on adultery charges in a military trial is punishable by penalties that could range from a dishonourable discharge to fines and imprisonment . 
critics have argued Flinn &apos;s case highlights a double-standard in the way the U.S. Armed Forces treats the issue of adultery among its male and female staff . 
Flinn &apos;s lawyers said if she recieved a less-than-honourable discharge from the Air Force , it could preclude her from flying for the National Guard or the military reserves . 
it might also hinder her civilian job prospects such as becoming a commercial airline pilot .
