the general overliquidity on the Polish money market was the main reason behind Tuesday &apos;s 0.17 point cut in the National Bank of Poland &apos;s ( NBP ) main 14-day drainage rate , now at 18.95 percent , dealers said . 
the cash-heavy market kept overnight deposit rates below 17 percent since August 22 and created huge demand at all NBP short-term drainages and on secondary T-bill markets . 
&quot; There was no fundamental reason for today &apos;s drainage rate cut other than the money market &apos;s overliquidity , &quot; said one foreign bank dealer in Warsaw . 
Polish banks bid to place 2.75 billion zlotys at the NBP &apos;s 2.5 billion zloty reverse repo , the central bank &apos;s first 14-day operation since August 20 . 
tomorrow / next rates were at 13.0 / 16.45 percent , up from 11.0 / 14.0 percent at 0640 GMT . 
the Central Statistical Office said on Tuesday that Polish food prices were flat in August 11-20 period and were 0.2 percent higher than in July 11-20 period . 
secondary market T-bill yields fell as banks and large institutional investors wanted to buy bills they failed to purchase at Monday &apos;s primary auction . 
the market focused on bills with up to three months to maturity and their yields fell to 18.5 / 18.45 percent from early 18.8 / 18.7 percent .

the Polish zloty closed softer at 1.77 / 1.71 percent from trading band centre against Monday &apos;s close at 1.80 / 1.75 percent after a light domestic-client enduced currency buying trend weakened the local unit in morning trade .
