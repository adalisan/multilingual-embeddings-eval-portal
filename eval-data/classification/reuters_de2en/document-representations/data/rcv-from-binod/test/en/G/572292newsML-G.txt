Japan will step up coastguard patrols around disputed islands in the East China Sea but will stop short of deploying its navy to halt a flotilla of Taiwanese and Hong Kong activists expected this month , government ministers said on Friday . 
the Maritime Safety Agency , Japan &apos;s coastguard , would forgo training drills and other scheduled events to strengthen patrols near the Senkaku Islands on May 18 , Transport Minister Makoto Koga told a news conference . 
may 18 is the date Taiwanese activists have said they plan to join with their Hong Kong counterparts in a &quot; large-scale action &quot; to back Taipei &apos;s and Beijing &apos;s claim to the isles , which are known as the Diaoyu Islands in Chinese . 
an old dispute over the uninhabited rocky outcrops in the East China Sea reignited this week when conservative legislator Shingo Nishimura visited the islands , which are administered by Japan as part of its Okinawa islands . 
Nishimura &apos;s visit to the islands , which lie 180 km ( 115 miles ) from Taiwan and about the same distance from islands making up the Okinawa chain , sparked fiery nationalistic passions in Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan . 
Japan has claimed the islands , located between Taiwan and Okinawa , since 1895 , while China says it has always owned them . 
Koga , whose ministry overseas the Maritime Safety Agency , declined to detail the agency &apos;s plans for May 18 . 
in a meeting of defence policy-makers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , Japan &apos;s defence minister ruled out using the country &apos;s navy to repel the Chinese activists , saying such an incursion would be an immigration issue outside the jurisdiction of the military . 
&quot; It would be an illegal entry into Japan , so the Self-Defence Forces ( SDF ) could not be mobilised , &quot; Defence Agency chief Fumio Kyuma said in response to fellow LDP legislators &apos; demands that naval vessels be dispatched . 
Japanese officials denounced the landing by Nishimura and three other people as an &quot; illegal act &quot; because the owner of the islands did not authorise it , but refused to back down in claiming sovereignty . 
Japan has appealed for calm on all sides , lest the dispute sour ties with China , which have improved recently after the territorial row flared up last year when a Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the contested isles .
