European straight-run fuel held steady on Thursday in very quiet business , though sellers hoping to get three figures for their material took comfort from the rise in Brent futures , traders said . 
low sulphur straight-run was only available out of Antwerp and Scandinavia and was being offered around $ 100- $ 101 fob . 
European public holidays meant most sellers were away from their desk and discussion was limited . 
the last physical deal was 25,000 tonnes believed traded from an Irish refiner to a French major on Tuesday at a price around $ 97 fob . 
Russian material was in short supply in the north . 
one M100 cargo was rumoured to have gone into Britain as bunker material , but the deal could not be confirmed . 
E-4 cargoes were in demand but none were on offer . 
Russian fuel oil flowed more freely in the Mediterranean and premiums were described as poor .
