the Supreme Court struck down Tuesday a state law requiring that candidates for top political , legislative and judicial office must pass drug tests before they can get on the ballot . 
the high court , by an 8-1 vote , declared unconstitutional a 1990 Georgia law mandating drug tests for candidates for governor , lieutenant governor and other top posts , heads of several agencies , state judges and state legislators . 
the ruling marked the first time the Supreme Court has invalidated a drug-testing requirement , programmes which have been used by the government and private employers across the country since the mid-1980s . 
since 1989 , the Supreme Court has upheld drug tests for student-athlethes , government workers and railroad employees , mainly out of concern for public safety , but it said the Georgia law went too far by violating privacy rights . 
the ruling represented a setback for Georgia and the Justice Department , which supported the law that required candidates submit to the tests . 
justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said for the court majority that there was no evidence the state had any fear or suspicion of illegal drug use by elected officials . 
&quot; What is left , after close review of Georgia &apos;s scheme , is a state interest not in public safety , but in projecting an image . 
Georgia seeks to display to the public its firm commitment to the struggle against drug abuse , &quot; she said . 
&quot; The need projected ... is symbolic , not actual and special , &quot; she said . 
&quot; However well meant , the candidate drug test that Georgia has devised diminishes personal privacy for a symbol &apos;s sake . 
Ginsburg said the constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures of evidence protected candidates against the urinalysis test at issue . 
under the law , any candidate who declined to take the test or who tested positive for one of five illegal drugs would be barred from holding office . 
Ginsburg said the law was not well designed to identify drug users . 
&quot; The test date is picked by the candidate , so all but the uncontrollably addicted could escape detection , &quot; she said . 
she said the Georgia law does not fit within the small category of constitutionally permissible drug tests that can be required without individualized suspicion of wrongdoing . 
Ginsburg concluded that the drug-testing ruling would not affect whether states may require medical examinations designed to provide certification of a candidate &apos;s general health or financial disclosure requirements . 
Steven Shapiro , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union , hailed the ruling as an important victory . 
&quot; The drug testing programme in this case was never anything more than political grandstanding . 
today &apos;s decision reaffirms the danger of allowing politicians to trade our personal privacy for political symbols , &quot; he said . 
Walker Chandler , a libertarian Party member who unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor in 1994 , was among those challenging the law , saying it amounted to an improper expansion of government power for merely symbolic purpose . 
chief Justice William Rehnquist was the lone dissenter , saying the privacy concerns implicated by the urinalysis test were &quot; negligible &quot; and warning that abuse of illegal drugs had become &quot; one of the major problems of our society . 
he said nothing in the Constitution prevents a state from adopting a law &quot; whose principal vice is that it may seem misguided or even silly to members of this court .
