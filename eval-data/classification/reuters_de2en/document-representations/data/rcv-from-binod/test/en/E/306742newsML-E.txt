Christmas shopping boosted sales at retail stores modestly during December , the Commerce Department said Tuesday , as business picked up at clothing and general merchandise stores . 
total retail sales increased last month by 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 208.2 billion after a revised 0.2 percent decline in November . 
that was slightly stronger than the 0.5 percent sales gain forecast by Wall Street economists . 
previously , the Commerce Department said total November retail sales had fallen by 0.4 percent . 
but it revised that to show a smaller decline . 
it also revised October sales up to a stronger 0.7 percent gain from the 0.3 percent rise it previously reported . 
&quot; Retail sales showed more strength than people anticipated , and point toward firmer growth in the fourth quarter , &quot; said Anthony Chan , chief economist at Banc One Investment advisors . 
&quot; That is underscored by strong upward revisions of overall retail sales in the prior month . 
sales of both long-lasting durable goods , like new cars , as well as non-durables such as food and clothing , rebounded in December from a November slump . 
sales of all types of durable goods rose 0.5 percent to $ 84.95 billion in December after a 0.4 percent drop in November , while sales of non-durables gained 0.7 percent to $ 123.24 billion following a 0.2 percent fall in November . 
earlier reports from major chain stores indicated that holiday sales were not as brisk as many had expected . 
despite strong job growth and rising incomes , consumers have held spending in check . 
economists said that might help curb inflation , since consumer spending on goods and services fuels two-thirds of national economic activity . 
&quot; It is still questionable whether momentum will continue well into 1997 , &quot; added Chan . 
&quot; This is called into question by weakness in this month &apos;s eating and drinking sales . 
when consumers are optimistic , they tend to eat out more . 
it &apos;s a leading indicator of future retail activity . 
sales at general merchandise stores rose in December by 0.5 percent to $ 26 billion , recovering a 0.5 percent decline during November . 
at apparel stores , sales of clothing increased 1.5 percent to $ 9.43 billion after falling 1.7 percent in November . 
sales of new cars were stronger in December , rising 0.7 percent to $ 50.9 billion following a 1 percent drop in November . 
new cars account for about one-fifth of total retail sales , so swings in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures . 
excluding cars , retail sales still were 0.6 percent higher in December after being flat in November . 
sales of building materials dropped 1.6 percent last month to $ 11 billion after a 0.7 percent decrease in November . 
sales at food stores rose 0.3 percent last month to $ 35.8 billion following a 0.1 percent November fall . 
gasoline service station sales increased 0.8 percent to $ 13.3 billion after rising 0.2 percent in November .
