President Bill Clinton started a cross-country campaign swing on Tuesday highlighting a hard-edged policy popular with middle-class voters , moving poor people from welfare to work . 
in this Midwestern city where in 1994 he formally proposed a plan to overhaul the much-despised U.S. public assistance system -- a plan that went nowhere in Congress -- Clinton held a roundtable discussion with six former welfare mothers , who now hold jobs with private firms , and their employers . 
&quot; The welfare system is about to change nationwide ... 
this new welfare reform law fundamentally changes the bargain , &quot; said the Democratic president , who last month signed into law a Republican-sponsored welfare reform plan that ends a 60-year-old guarantee of federal aid to the poor . 
he said he was convinced the only way states will be able to move large numbers of people from welfare to work in a short time &quot; is with a partnership with the private sector &quot; modelled on a plan being tested in Missouri and 11 other states . 
under the plan , funds that used to be spent on public assistance are reallocated to subsidise employers to hire and train welfare recipients . 
&quot; We &apos;re basically trying to break a mindset and an almost physical isolation from the world of work , &quot; Clinton said . 
later , in a speech to a meeting of the Southern Governors &apos; Conference , Clinton said state leaders had demanded welfare reform , and it was up to them to make it work . 
&quot; We have now moved welfare beyond the realm of political rhetoric and blame , and it &apos;s no longer a question of who to blame , it is entirely a question of what are we going to do , &quot; he said . 
leading Republican challenger Bob Dole by a substantial margin in the public opinion polls less than eight weeks before the Nov . 5 presidential election , Clinton was clearly determined to maintain his momentum . 
in response to a reporter &apos;s question , he rejected Dole &apos;s criticism of a new federal law that lets workers take time off to care for a new baby or sick family member . 
dole said it was unwarranted government intrusion . 
it &apos;s not a big radical step . 
it &apos;s pro-family and pro-work , &quot; Clinton said . 
but even as his re-election bandwagon rumbled along , two political problems nipped at Clinton &apos;s heels -- a sex scandal involving former top campaign aide Dick Morris and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein &apos;s penchant for mischief in the Gulf . 
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters the White House had known since &quot; sometime in 1995 &quot; that Morris , the man behind the president &apos;s emphasis on &quot; family values , &quot; had fathered a child in an extramaritial affair six years ago . 
and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said the administration was watching Iraqi military activity in southern Iraq . 
military moves in northern Iraq triggered U.S. cruise missile strikes last week . 
Morris abruptly quit the Clinton campaign two weeks ago after a supermarket tabloid reported that he shared White House secrets with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute with whom he had a year-long affair in Washington . 
Clinton also planned to highlight his education proposals at a campaign rally in St. Louis on Tuesday and was to focus on crime-stopping and health benefits for the elderly at rallies in Colorado and Arizona on Wednesday . 
he was to spend Thursday in California , the biggest prize on Nov . 5 , with 54 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election . 
the latest survey by a respected independent pollster put Clinton ahead of Dole by 23 percentage points . 
campaign aides said Clinton also enjoyed a double-digit lead in traditionally Democratic Missouri , a state Clinton carried in 1992 , and claimed there were signs Dole , from neighbouring Kansas , might write off its 11 electoral votes . 
they said Clinton also led in Colorado , a Rocky Mountain swing state whose eight electoral votes he carried in 1992 , and in traditionally Republican Arizona , whose eight electoral votes went to Republican President George Bush in 1992 .
