Romania &apos;s parliament on Thursday ratified a recently signed friendship treaty with Hungary , which is expected to help the two former Warsaw pact members join NATO and the European Union . 
Members of the 341-strong lower Chamber of Deputies voted by 159 to one , with 27 abstentions , to ratify the long-delayed &quot; understanding , cooperation and good neighbourhood &quot; treaty . 
Parliament &apos;s upper house , the Senate , endorsed the treaty last week . 
the treaty is the &quot; first such document signed by Romania in time of peace , liberty , sovereignity and independence , &quot; Bucharest radio said . 
the pact , agreed under Western pressure , settles old border rifts and provides guarantees for the rights of the 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania &apos;s central Transylvania region . 
MPs of both the nationalist Romanian National Party ( PUNR ) and the Hungarian Democratic Union ( UDMR ) , a party representing the interests of Romania &apos;s 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians , have refused to vote on Thursday , the state radio said . 
&quot; The ambiguity of some articles in the treaty can harm Romania &apos;s national sovereignity , &quot; PUNR deputy Costica Ciurtin said . 
&quot; The wording of the treaty does not meet the ( Hungarian ) minority &apos;s expectations , &quot; Bucharest radio quoted a UDMR parliamentarian as saying . 
the accord , signed by Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn and his Romanian counterpart Nicolae Vacaroiu in the western city of Timisoara on September 16 , has yet to be promulgated by Romanian President Ion Iliescu .
