European high sulphur fuel oil barges edged up on Wednesday while Russian cargoes traded strong with tight prompt avails the main factor behind the market strength , traders said . 
high sulphur barges reached as high as $ 96.25 fob Rotterdam after earlier trades at $ 96 and $ 95.50 a tonne early in the day , or the higher range of trade a day earlier . 
one deal was reported late at $ 95.75 in Antwerp . 
&quot; Yesterday there was good bunker demand , today it is not so busy but there were a couple of big orders . 
people are covering short positions , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; There &apos;s certainly no oversupply in the market . 
Russian cracked M-100 was traded at two means + $ 2.75 , with the bunker spec material bought by a major , for delivery into the U.K. east coast . 
&quot; It &apos;s a good number although freight into the east coast ( of the U.K. ) is a little bit more expensive than into Rotterdam . 
Bascially there &apos;s not that much Russian material around , especially bunker spec , &quot; a trader said . 
a second trader seconded the view saying bunker spec was in very low supply in NWE , adding the trade &quot; reflects that the market is strong , especially on bunker spec &quot; .
