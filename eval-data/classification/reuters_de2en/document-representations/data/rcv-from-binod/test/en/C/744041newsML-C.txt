British media giant United News &amp; Media plc confirmed on Monday that it was trying to strengthen its position in the British digital television market by taking a 30 percent stake in the winner of a national digital television licence . 
in a brief statement , United News said it was in talks with S4C -- the digital subsidiary of Welsh Channel Four -- with a view to taking a stake in its Digital Networks Ltd ( SDN ) wholly-owned subsidiary to operate the least powerful of six digital terrestrial TV licences . 
S4C , which will be running commercial services on remaining space on that block of frequencies , and Channel 5 had already been guaranteed slots on so-called Multiplex A. 
United News is one of four owner of Channel 5 . 
British broadcasting regulator the Independent Television Commission ( ITC ) has said previously that it would award a licence to S4C but it said the licence was conditional on the group &apos;s stake in SDN being no more than 50.1 percent . 
SDN has said that it has been in discussions with interested parties .
