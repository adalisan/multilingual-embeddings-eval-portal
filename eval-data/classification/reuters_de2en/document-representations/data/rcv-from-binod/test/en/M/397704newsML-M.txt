Colombia &apos;s peso closed 4.65 units lower against the dollar at 1,082.95 amid nervousness in the interbank market over a possible move by the United States to clamp economic sanctions on the country . 
in an annual report required by Congress , U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to announce Thursday whether Colombia should be &quot; certified &quot; as a trustworthy ally in the anti-drug fight this year . 
a second consecutive decertification could trigger painful economic sanctions that Clinton stopped short of imposing in 1996 . 
dealers said there was no sizable increase in demand for U.S. currency because of the sanctions threat . 
but they said dollar-selling was lighter than usual , and that weighed on the peso and traders &apos; sentiment all day . 
&quot; The market was speculating with the foreign exchange rate using decertification as a pretext , &quot; one dealer said . 
dealers reported 395 trades for a total of $ 158 million and said the peso , which was erroneously reported to have closed at 1,070 Friday , traded in a range of 1,076.90 to 1,083 .
