limitless March CME lumber futures surged over $ 23.00 per thousand board feet and other months closed higher to sharply higher in an expanded trading limit of $ 15.00 as a techinical rebound and firmer cash talk combined to spark short covering , traders said . 
March finished up $ 23.40 at $ 385.00 and May up $ 11.90 at $ 368.60 per tbf . 
other months ended $ 6.70 to $ 1.00 higher . 
&quot; It &apos;s short covering and a little bit oversold , technical sort of bounce , &quot; said curt Cunningham , President of Pacific futures Trading . 
Technicals included gaps in the chart after recent losses . 
Chartists noted that March posted a $ 60 break in the past three weeks and May had left three gaps in the charts which is considered a reason for a technical rebound . 
traders also noted reports that the cash lumber showed fresh support after recent quiet trade and falling prices that had put March at a sharp $ 20 discount to cash . 
cash business developed late Monday and added to early demand that reversed two days of limit losses , they said . 
futures had tumbled recently , taking cues from a $ 23 break in cash spruce prices last week . 
ING also spread long March / short May with Rand Financials early . 
ABN Chicogo Corp and Smith Barney bought March , pit sources said .
