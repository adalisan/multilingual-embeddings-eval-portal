despite favorable market conditions , local politics will probably discourage Brazil from tapping global debt markets this quarter , traders and analysts said . 
&quot; It makes sense to borrow dollars now , but I wouldn &apos;t be surprised if politics gets in the way , &quot; said Hans Ostlund , a director at West Merchant Bank &apos;s Brazil office . 
warm market reception Tuesday for Argentina &apos;s jumbo $ 2 billion 20-year bond raised speculation that Brazil would follow soon with a sizeable dollar issue . 
but Brasilia &apos;s current preoccupation with getting a controversial amendment through Congress that would allow President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for a second term was seen delaying any new deal . 
&quot; The government is not going to launch anything until re-election is resolved , &quot; said a Eurobond trader at a leading international bank in Brazil . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see them doing anything in the first quarter , maybe the second . 
also , some officials at the Central Bank think rating agencies could upgrade Brazil &apos;s current B-plus credit risk if the re-election amendment passes . 
&quot; The government would prefer to wait because it would make no sense to issue before an upgrade , &quot; said Mauro Schneider , chief economist at ING Barings in Brazil . 
the success of the Argentine bond and recent enthusiasm for emerging market debt helped narrow spreads on Brazil &apos;s benchmark 8-7 / 8 percent global bond of 2001 to their tightest level since the issue was priced last November . 
the bond , which was issued at 265 basis points over U.S. treasuries and quickly traded off to 290 bps over , was trading Wednesday at 248 bps over . 
but the favorable market conditions may not last , especially with a steady supply of Latin American debt forecast over the next few weeks . 
and even if Brazil moved quickly to put a deal together , the country might still miss its chance , local traders said . 
&quot; Argentina came out at a great time . 
but it takes at least a month to put something together and the timing is now , &quot; one trader said . 
Brazil debt watchers said the country had to be more careful about timing its next large global issue to avoid the poor reception its benchmark received in November , when the market was oversupplied with Latin American paper . 
economists noted , however , that unlike Mexico and Argentina , Brazil does not have to tap external capital markets to finance its fiscal deficit , removing any urgency to issue . 
the Central Bank has primarily launched small deals of about $ 150 million to open up new markets for corporate issuers . 
its $ 750 million global bond last November was mainly issued to provide a benchmark and create a yield curve for the market , economists said .
