Jordan &apos;s stock market fell at the end of weekly trade on Wednesday with renewed selling pressure by mostly floor traders weighing down prices in a sluggish day &apos;s trade , dealers said . 
the official Amman Financial Market 60-share index shed 0.34 percent to 153.05 points in low 689,704 dinars ( $ 974,158 ) turnover . 
top price gainers were Industrial Development Bank and Housing Bank rising 2.24 percent to 2.28 dinars and 1.50 percent to 4.75 dinars respectively . 
both banks have postive earnings outlook for 1996 , dealers said . 
&quot; There was selling by speculators which dampened overall sentiment with more supply of stock than buying orders , &quot; said one broker . 
many investors seemed content to stay on the sidelines , with few incentives for active buying in the cash-short market , dealers said . 
most of the selling pressure came from floor traders , they said 
a 1.50 dinar drop in market heavy weight Arab Bank to 260 dinars helped drag down the official index . 
the share rose on Tuesday on expectations of a bonus share after the government approves soon a new companies law that abolishes a capitalisation tax . 
the market has been recently buttressed by brighter performance of industrials that stand to benefit from exports to Iraq , which helped give the market a good New Year kick-off . 
unified Transport Company , one of the companies that are seen to benefit from expanded transport activity with Iraq , shed 0.02 dinars to 2.19 dinars , with 85,653 dinars worth of shares exchanging hands .
