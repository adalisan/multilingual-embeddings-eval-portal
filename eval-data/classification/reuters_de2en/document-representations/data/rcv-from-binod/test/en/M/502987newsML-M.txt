the dollar will likely stay on the path of consolidation near term but try for a break higher in the latter part of next week , chartists said . 
&quot; Over the next couple of days , I think we probably range ( trade ) more , maybe even test yesterday &apos;s lows at 125.55 ( yen ) and maybe even get a little bit below there , &quot; said David Solin , a partner at Foreign Exchange analytics . 
still , Solin said he expects the dollar to resume its climb once some of the concerns about recent comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and others fade from the market . 
&quot; I think people will start to get some more nerve and they start to buy dollar again , &quot; Solin said . 
on Thursday , Rubin said the United States shared Japan &apos;s concern about the weak yen but the Treasury Secretary also stressed U.S. dollar policy was unchanged . 
a close on Friday below 125.40 yen , the April 8 low , means the dollar will probably test lower levels and slip back into a &quot; sloppy &quot; trading range , said John Tirone , a technical analyst at Chase Securities Inc . 
the dollar could make a play for new highs next week , but Tirone contended it will have to close above 126.40 yen for those new highs to be intact . 
on Thursday , the dollar briefly hit 127.16 yen , a 56-month high . 
foreign Exchange analytics &apos; Solin said the dollar could climb to 128 yen or slightly higher by the end of next week . 
&quot; I just think the rate of ascent of the move is really going to slow down , &quot; he added . 
since the beginning of the year , the dollar has appreciated nearly 10 percent versus the Japanese currency . 
the dollar also lost ground to the German currency on Friday , slipping to 1.7200 / 10 marks at 1600 EDT / 2000 GMT from 1.7244 / 49 at the open . 
Tirone pegged key support in the area of 1.7120 / 40 marks . 
he said the dollar needs to hold 1.7120 to 1.7140 marks on a closing basis in order to continue the upside momentum in the very short-term . 
&quot; You really want to see it close above 1.7220 ( marks ) in an ideal situation , &quot; Tirone added .
