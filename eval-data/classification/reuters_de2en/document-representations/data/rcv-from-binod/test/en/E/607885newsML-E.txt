Spanish efforts to qualify for Europe &apos;s single currency have won backing at home and abroad , but experts do not believe foreign direct investment will necessarily reflect such enthusiasm . 
economists said the recent success of key privatisations -- Telefonica and energy group Repsol -- have underscored Spain &apos;s new financial and economic stability and was luring foreign money over the border . 
but this new financial credibility will not be enough to make Spanish factories good value or attract the real , steady investments that the government would like . 
&quot; Of course a steady flurry of investments is what ( Prime Minister ) Aznar &apos;s government would like . 
who would not ? 
but they will not get it easily because Spain is now too expensive , &quot; said Henrik Lumholdt , chief economist at Bank of America in Madrid . 
although still cheaper than other developed European countries , such as France or Germany , Spanish labour costs are now higher than the former communist nations of Eastern Europe or other countries , such as Ireland . 
Spain &apos;s conservative government has made qualifying for European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) its top priority . 
it has made dramatic strides in improving fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability in the past year , encouraging huge gains in the debt market . 
the 10-year spread over Bunds narrowed to a historic low of 64 basis points on Wednesday from 330 bps in March 1996 , while stocks are firing all pistons , breaking a string of highs . 
in April , European Union Commission forecasts showed a high probability that Spain would qualify to join EMU from the start . 
commenting on the forecast , Aznar said Spain was becoming a very stable , reliable asset . 
&quot; This is a clear outlook of stability and security for investors and savers , and also for employees and employers , &quot; Aznar told a news conference . 
Spain offers two of the most classic ingredients for investments in abundance -- land and labour . 
standing at above 21 percent , unemployment is the highest in Europe while the density of population is among the lowest in comparison with continental Europe . 
in 1986 , when Spain joined the single European market , foreign direct investment blossomed , fuelling economic growth to one of the highest rates in Europe . 
and now the government seems to hope history will repeat itself if it is successful in joining EMU . 
but although foreign direct investment in Spain rose 21.6 percent in 1996 to 2.08 trillion pesetas , an average of the past four years showed the country experienced a slow decline in the flow of foreign money after a real boom during the 1980s . 
recent Bank of Spain data showed foreign direct investment as a percentage of gross domestic product fell from 2.5 in 1989-1991 to 1.6 in the 1992-1996 period . 
financial data suggests foreigners , whose buying of shares jumped 48 percent in 1996 from 1995 , ended the year with a negative net direct investment in listed companies . 
at the end of December 1996 their net direct investment was 45 billion less than one year before . 
using a traditional recipe , the conservative government is trying to liberalise both land and labour , a key move to boost direct investment in the country , experts said . 
&quot; Only if Spain gets cheaper labour costs can it successfully compete with other countries in attracting investment &quot; , said Boa &apos;s Lumholdt . 
more direct investment could boost an economy in which per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) is still 15 to 20 percent below than the European average . 
&quot; The problem with Spain is its industrial structure is still weak . 
they need foreign investment to support development , &quot; a western diplomat told Reuters . 
this fund inflow emerged during the 1980s . 
&quot; The Spanish economy depends a lot on foreign direct investment , &quot; said Giorgio Radaelli , economist at Lehman Brothers in London . 
&quot; The big boom was after its entry into the single market , when it was still offering cheap production costs . 
but the pace is proving hard to maintain . 
&quot; Spain can &apos;t go back to mid-80s ( foreign investment ) levels , but it can hold foreign investments at a level of around 1.0-1.5 percent of its GDP , which will be very important in guaranteeing solid economic growth , &quot; Radaelli added .
