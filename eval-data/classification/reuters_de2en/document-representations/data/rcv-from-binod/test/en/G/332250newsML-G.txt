each day , new clues surface as gamblers , pundits and politicians engage in a furious guessing game over when Britain will go to the polls . 
never mind that Prime Minister John Major may be the only man to know -- and even he may not know yet -- the guessers are sure election day will be May 1 . 
or April 10 . 
or March 20 . 
take your pick . 
one thing is sure : may 22 is the last legal date that Major can hold an election under the 1911 Parliament Act and the guessing will not stop until he actually names his day . 
&quot; I &apos;ll call an election when I think it is appropriate , &quot; Major said when asked for the umpteenth time about his preference . 
common sense dictates that Major , whose Conservatives are some 20 points behind Labour in the polls , waits as long as possible in the hope support finally picks up as improved economic conditions work their way into voters &apos; wallets . 
tradition dictates it will be a Thursday , though not Maundy Thursday ( March 27 ) , one of the few days apart from weekends and public holidays on which polling is not allowed . 
plenty of non-political factors are also worth considering , from the state of the weather to voters &apos; holiday plans . 
a March election is considered risky because clocks have yet to go forward , making for dark days , depressed voters and a low turnout . 
may would be balmier yet the first of the month is Labour Day : a fact the opposition might use to its advantage . 
an early April election would mean campaigning over the Easter holidays , ruled out by many experts , while voting in late April would lead to extreme voter fatigue as local elections are slated for May 1 . 
in short , any guess ends up looking as good as the next . 
&quot; It &apos;s all about views and judgements and hunches and educated guesses . 
the only thing of which I &apos;m certain is the lack of insider information , &quot; said Simon Clare , political betting spokesman for Ladbrokes bookmakers . 
&quot; The date of the next election is the best kept secret in the world . 
pundits nevertheless spend hours tracking parties &apos; plans for advertising , conferences and speeches , poring over the dropped ( or deliberately dropped ) comments of those deemed in the know . 
all the crystal ball-gazing will however count for nought if Major is forced by parliamentary arithmetic to call a snap election . 
the Conservatives are now level with the combined opposition on 322 seats and defeat on a key vote could trigger a vote of no confidence or persuade Major that he could no longer command enough support in parliament . 
once Major finally picks his date , he must ask Queen Elizabeth for permission to dissolve parliament and only then can campaigning begin . 
there then follow 17 frenzied days until the election , not counting weekends and and bank holidays . 
labour says it hopes the election day comes sooner rather than later &quot; to put the country out of its misery &quot; . 
&quot; We would like the government to call an election immediately to end this speculation and put the issues at stake to the test of the people . 
the only reason for the delay is that they are frightened to meet that test , &quot; said a Labour spokesman . 
the gamblers &apos; choice is May 1 , the same date as local elections and widely considered the last feasible date that Major can go to the nation and plead for his job back . 
yet the fact that two Conservative ministers who are not known to see eye to eye both hinted at a May 1 vote on the very same day was enough for pundits to declare May 1 a red herring . 
bookmakers duly shortened odds for a March election . 
some pundits say Major will look decisive to voters if he goes for March and does not wait until the last possible date . 
Ladbrokes &apos; Clare said odds were changing daily to keep pace with frenetic speculation about the election &apos;s timing , with a series of large telephone bets swinging towards an early poll . 
&quot; It &apos;s all very unusual . 
the focus is now on when ( the election will be held ) rather than who ( will win ) , &quot; he said . 
William Hill bookmakers , which rates May as favourite with odds of 8-11 , say rumour-mongering is rife . 
&quot; There has been a great deal of disinformation deliberately spread about the dates to put people off the real scent , &quot; said Graham Sharpe of William Hill . 
he said odds on an April election were now set at 5-2 , March at 9-4 and February at 33-1 . 
&quot; bets have been coming in since the last election but we are confident May is entitled to be hot favourite , &quot; he said . 
not everyone agrees . 
take the senior Conservative member of parliament who left his private diary in a House of Commons corridor , perhaps revealing the best kept secret of British politics or else the wishful scribblings of a political dreamer . 
the MP had ringed Thursday April 17 as his preferred date and pencilled in May 1 as second favourite . 
Downing Street would not be drawn on Major &apos;s choice . 
nor on the choice of a Frenchman who stands to win 6,000 pounds ( $ 9,942 ) if his bet on a March election comes off . 
&quot; He &apos;s a regular client based in Monte Carlo who only bets on horses as a rule . 
it &apos;s the biggest single bet we &apos;ve taken on the date of the election and is a little unexpected coming from a foreign punter , &quot; said William Hill &apos;s Sharpe . 
as for the source of the Frenchman &apos;s tip , Sharpe said : &quot; Who knows , perhaps some Conservative MPs went to Monte Carlo on a &quot; fact-finding trip &apos; and talked up a March election at the casino tables . 
as long as the punters pay up , we don &apos;t ask questions .
