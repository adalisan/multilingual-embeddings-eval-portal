European Union foreign ministers made little tangible progress towards agreement on wide-ranging bloc reforms during a two-day meeting that was sidetracked by a row over human rights in China . 
the problems of getting agreement within the 15-nation bloc , which has aspirations to take in up to a dozen new members , highlights an urgent need to review the EU &apos;s institutions . 
warning of a potential clash between the bloc &apos;s larger and smaller nations , French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said on Monday that failure to change the policy-making system would result &quot; in an enlarged Europe , but a Europe that is paralysed &quot; . 
despite broad agreement that the 20-seat executive European Commission should be streamlined to cope with a bloc of up to 27 nations , the smaller members refuse to give up their seats at the Brussels high-table . 
&quot; There &apos;s an absolute frontier between the large and small members . 
it should not be us , the smaller , who pay for enlargement , &quot; Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen told reporters at the end of the meeting in this Dutch coastal town . 
acknowledging the difficulties in moving towards closer integration , particularly on foreign and security policy , Germany &apos;s Klaus Kinkel said : &quot; You can &apos;t expect the EU to produce foreign policy at the push of a button . 
that doesn &apos;t work . 
the Dutch EU presidency called the extra ministerial session in an attempt to give new impetus to an inter-governmental conference ( IGC ) which aims to agree sensitive reforms to be rubber-stamped at a mid-June Amsterdam summit . 
the Hague is concerned that the high-profile run-up to monetary union and trouble-spotssuch as Albania have deflected attention away from setting the seal on wide-ranging reforms . 
but the meeting , bogged down over how many seats a new Commission should have and how member states &apos; votes should be weighted to represent their populations , was hijacked by discord over whether to condemn China over its human rights record . 
Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo had hoped to get full backing for an EU censure of China to be tabled at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva , but France , with support from Germany and Italy , broke ranks saying dialogue with China was better than confrontation . 
that prompted Denmark to say it would table a resolution against China in Geneva this week . 
Beijing reacted sharply , warning Copenhagen that such a move would damage relations . 
rebuking some members for having double standards in seeking to criticise smaller nations , such as Burma and Nigeria , over human rights but refusing to condemn &quot; commercially important &quot; nations , like China , van Mierlo warned that the internal rift threatened to damage the EU &apos;s credibility on the world stage . 
China has previously succeeded in blocking Western efforts to have a resolution passed on its rights record . 
despite the lack of real progress on internal reforms , ministers signalled they were edging towards an Amsterdam Treaty which has to be signed before the bloc can start negotiations with ex-communist countries wanting to join the western club . 
&quot; I &apos;m absolutely sure we &apos;ll have a result we can all live with , &quot; said Kinkel . 
van Mierlo said that after months of listening and analysing members &apos; views , the talks were entering the final bend . 
&quot; It &apos;s time to start putting forward compromises in the knowledge that final deals will only be struck near the end , &quot; he told a news conference . 
the Dutch face a tight schedule . 
if the IGC review is not completed by June , enlargement talks will be delayed and risk becoming mired in crucial decisions on monetary union and in French and German general elections next year .
