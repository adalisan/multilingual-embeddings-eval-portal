a storm that poured more than a foot-and-a-half ( 0.5 metre ) of rain on parts of New England , left more than 100,000 people without drinking water and washed out roads and bridges on Tuesday . 
police said at least one person had been reported missing . 
the rain had ended or tapered to showers in the hardest hit areas , but a state of emergency remained in effect for parts of Maine , Massachusetts and all of New Hampshire where the threat of river and coastal flooding remained . 
&quot; I did see something in ( the town of ) Wells that I &apos;ve never seen in my life , a snow plough clearing seaweed off the roads , &quot; Maine Gov. 
Angus King told reporters after touring the damage area by helicopter . 
King said it was too early to estimate the damage in his state , but a request would be made for federal emergency assistance . 
authorities in New Hampshire kept a close eye on the Saco and Lamprey rivers that were both above flood stage . 
rivers in Massachusetts were slowly dropping from rainfall received over the weekend . 
dams also remained a concern in Northern New England . 
residents near Highland Lake in Westbrook , Maine , were urged to evacuate Tuesday after water began flowing around the lake &apos;s dam . 
&quot; A deluge of misery &quot; read a banner headline in the Portland Press Herald . 
Portland received 12.27 inches ( 29.7 cm ) of rain from the storm that began late ( on ) Sunday -- three times what it normally gets in the entire month of October . 
camp Ellis received 19.19 inches ( 48.7 cm ) rain from the storm , which was &quot; perhaps the greatest storm total since precipitation records have been established for Maine , &quot; the National weather Service declared . 
rainwater runoff broke the primary supply pipe of the Portland Water District , leaving 140,000 residents of the state &apos;s largest city and surrounding communities without drinking water Tuesday . 
travel remained tricky through the region . 
in Boston , portions of the subway system remained closed because of flood damage on Monday to Kenmore Square , an important junction , which remained under water , a day after the storm left the city . 
rescue crews searched for a driver who disappeared on Monday night when his pickup drove into a washed out road in Saco , Maine . 
the storm , which has battered the northeast since Saturday , has been blamed for four deaths . 
emergency shelters were set up in coastal communities in Maine and New Hampshire , although several in the Portland area had to be moved when the drinking water system failed , authorities said . 
not everyone heeded evacuation calls . 
&quot; I &apos;d go with the house if it went , &quot; said Harry Ivers , who has lived along Mill Brook in Westbrook , Maine , for 28 years . 
one of Ivers &apos; neighbours admitted he ignored a roadblock and fell into a washout . 
scores of schools in the region closed for the second day , as flooding made roads impassable . 
some schools were being used to shelter people from a dozen different communities driven from their homes by the floods , the Massachusetts Red Cross said . 
the rain continued in central and Down East Maine , but the low pressure system that produced the foul weather was weakening as it moved towards the Canadian Maritimes , according to the National weather Service .
