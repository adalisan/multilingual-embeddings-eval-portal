police on Friday said they had arrested four men on suspicion of planning to spring one of Italy &apos;s most notorious Mafia bosses from a top security jail in Sicily . 
the four were arrested over the past few days after undercover investigations by Italy &apos;s elite dia anti-Mafia squad . 
police said the group had been planning an operation to help convicted mob boss Benedetto &quot; Nitto &quot; Santapaola escape from the Bicocca maximum security prison in Catania , eastern Sicily . 
they gave no details but judicial sources said the dia believed the group had planned to try to bribe wardens . 
Santapoala , a 58-year-old former shoe salesman who built up a lucrative car sales business in Catania , was arrested in May 1993 after 11 years on the run . 
the suspected number two in the Mafia hierarchy , he has already been convicted of murder and is among mobsters on trial for the assassination in 1992 of leading anti-Mafia investigator Giovanni Falcone . 
Santapaola &apos;s wife , Carmela , was shot dead in 1995 in a vendetta . 
the judicial sources said the alleged plot to spring Santapaola came to light in February 1996 when the dia bugged a meeting in Catania of suspected Mafiosi . 
the jailbreak attemptwas apparently not carried out because security at the prison was stepped up after a pistol was discovered in one the cells , the sources said . 
the pistol was smuggled into the jail in an affair unrelated to the alleged plot , they added .
