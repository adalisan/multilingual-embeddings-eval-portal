the Croatian interbank rates were stable on Monday as better supply of kuna brought relief to the market after almost one month &apos;s shortages , dealers said . 
but the banking sector increased its Lombard borrowing from the central bank to 117.6 million kuna ahead of repayment of the same amount in repo funds taken out last week , a bank official told Reuters . 
the money market trade fetched 55.6 million kuna by 0900 GMT as banks sought to replenish their resources before reserve payment . 
&quot; There was plenty of money on offer , but demand was also quite strong , &quot; said one dealer . 
the morning trade left a 15 million surplus in supply , but five million in demand for term funds found no creditors . 
they also denied a loan to one bank which exceeded its debt-limit . 
most new deals were call money loans at 10.5 percent and one smaller seven-day loan was made at 11 percent . 
overnight trade over the weekend came close to 70 million kuna , which went to five banks with shortfalls .
