French bond futures climbed to their highest level since March 4 as a surprise decline in U.S. wholesale prices in April buoyed major debt markets . 
the bond contract broke through resistance at 130.56 soon after the release and began to make inroads into a gap up to 130.84 late in the session before settling up 0.26 at 130.64 . 
some analysts said it was clear the French market was taking a big bet on the May 25 / June 1 parliamentary election as even though seat projections in recent polls gave the centre-right a majority , it was neck and neck in terms of voting intentions for the first round . 
&quot; It was mainly the American figures &quot; that lifted the market , Dominique Barbet , bond analyst at Banque Paribas , said . 
traders said the short end of the curve benefitted from short covering by non-residents early on Tuesday both in interest rate futures and BTANs , bringing in the two-year spread over German yields as low as 11 basis points . 
the rebound at the short end , mainly a reversal of bearish trades put on at the end of April , also helped longer-dated French bonds , the traders said . 
&quot; The French market , the franc , equities and bonds , is taking a big bet &quot; on a win for the centre-right coalition , Barbet said . 
Eric Chaney , economist at Morgan Stanley , said he remained &quot; extremely sceptical of any ( seat ) extrapolations &quot; by polling organisations and was sticking to the rule of thumb that if the centre-right captured 40 percent or more votes they survive but anything below that was not clear . 
despite the positive market moves on Wednesday several traders said the bond market now looked overbought and would be prone to profit taking and options covering strategies even though the solid base of domestic investors would limit any declines . 
analysts said the key to the election would be if and how National Front voters transfered their votes to other parties in the second round on June 1 . 
&quot; What the markets will be looking at very closely is to find exactly where the National Front transfer votes are likely to go and it is certainly an open question , &quot; Joanne Perez , strategist at Merrill Lynch said . 
recent polls suggest that the majority of extreme-right National Front voters will back the ruling coalition although their leader Jean-Marie Le Pen has called for supporters to vote for the left in protest against President Jacques Chirac . 
an options trader at a French brokerage said they were recommending for investors to cover their positions . 
the most active June bond options contracts were the 130 and 129 puts , closely followed by the 128 puts , as was the case on Tuesday . 
it was a similar story for June PIBOR options with nearly 6,000 96.0 puts changing hands , six times the amount traded at any other strike price . 
Barbet warned that next week would probably be far more volatile as the market would be driven by poll rumours rather than published results . 
French law prohibits the publication of poll results in the week before an election . 
the franc remained steady around 3.3680 per mark and like most French assets appeared to have shrugged off any jitters about the outcome of the French election . 
the Treasury was due to sell 20-22 billion francs of two- and five-year BTANs on Thursday with the results due from 0900 GMT .
