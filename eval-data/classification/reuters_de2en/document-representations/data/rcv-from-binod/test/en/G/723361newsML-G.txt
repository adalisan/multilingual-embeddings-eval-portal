a federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the U.S. government from deporting seven Palestinians and a Kenyan linked to what Washington says is a Palestinian terrorist group . 
the U.S. government has been trying for more than 10 years to deport the seven Palestinian men and a Kenyan woman , who have become known as the &quot; L.A. ( Los Angeles ) 8 . 
the 9th U.S. 
circuit Appeals Court in San Francisco upheld the decisions of a federal district judge in Los Angeles blocking deportation proceedings against the eight immigrants who , according to the court record , are affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) . 
the court also rejected a government argument that a recent change in immigration law meant that the federal courts no longer had jurisdiction over the case . 
the government had appealed the district court ruling , focusing on new evidence that the eight immigrants participated in fund-raising activities for the PFLP . 
but the appeals court said that &quot; targeting individuals because of activities such as fund raising is impermissible unless the government can show that group members had the specific intent to pursue illegal group goals . 
&quot; This is a tremendous decision , &quot; David Cole , a lawyer who represented the eight for the New York-based Centre for Constitutional Rights , said in a statement . 
&quot; The government &apos;s evidence showed that our clients had at most distributed literature , engaged in political demonstrations and raised money for lawful activities . 
today &apos;s decision confirms that all people in the United States have a First Amendment right to do just that , &quot; he said . 
a Justice Department spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment . 
the Immigration and Naturalisation Service ( ins ) has sought to deport the eight , maintaining that the PFLP is &quot; an international terrorist and communist organisation , &quot; the court record said . 
the district court , however , concluded that the PFLP was engaged in a wide range of lawful activities such as providing education , health care and organising cultural activities . 
the eight contested deportation on the grounds that it violated their constitutional free speech rights under the First Amendment . 
they alleged the ins had singled them out for selective enforcement of the immigration laws in retaliation for constitutionally protected activity . 
the district judge in Los Angeles first granted a preliminary injunction barring the deportation of six of the group and then granted a similar order for the other two . 
earlier this year , government lawyers introduced 10,000 pages of new evidence that they said showed that the eight supported PFLP fund-raising activities that were not protected by the First Amendment . 
the eight immigrants are Aiad Barakat , Naim Sharif , Khader Hamide , Michael Shehadeh , Bashar Amer and brothers Ayman and Amjad Obeid -- all Palestinians -- and Hamidi &apos;s wife , Julie Mungai from Kenya .
