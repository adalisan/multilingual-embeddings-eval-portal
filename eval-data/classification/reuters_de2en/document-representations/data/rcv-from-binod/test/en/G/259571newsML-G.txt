men who smoke can damage their sperm and pass the risk of cancer on to their children , British researchers reported on Monday . 
a study by researchers at the University of Birmingham indicated that up to 15 percent of childhood cancers could be due to smoking by fathers . 
&quot; Fathers who smoked 20 or more cigarettes a day had a 42 percent increased risk of having a child with cancer , &quot; Dr Thomas Sorahan of the University of Birmingham told a news conference . 
those who smoked between 10 and 20 cigarettes a day had a 31 percent increased risk compared to non-smokers , while those who smoked less than 10 cigarettes a day still increased their children &apos;s risk of cancer by three percent . 
Sorahan &apos;s group looked at data from the Oxford Survey of Childhood cancers , a review of more than 1,500 parents whose children died of cancer between 1953 and 1955 . 
they compared the figures with 1,500 parents whose children did not have cancer during the same period . 
&quot; We started out with a very precise and detailed hypothesis -- that a mother &apos;s smoking was not a risk factor to childhood cancer but a father &apos;s is , &quot; Sorahan said . 
Sorahan &apos;s group had seen studies in the United States that indicated cigarette smoke could damage sperm and said this backed their epidemiological study -- one looking at actual incidences of disease in a population . 
the findings were striking , he said , and were clear even when other factors such as social class , whether the mother smoked , whether the mother had been x-rayed during pregnancy and the age of the parents were taken into account . 
Sorahan said his group was now looking at more recent data , from 1971 to 1976 . 
but he said the older surveys might be more reliable . 
&quot; Those data were collected well before stop-smoking campaigns were in full flow , so maybe there were more accurate answers , &quot; he said . 
parental smoking has also been linked by other research to cot death or sudden infant death syndrome , and mothers who smoke risk having smaller babies . 
&quot; This new study gives a compelling reason for men who smoke and want children to quit , &quot; said Gordon McVie , director general of the Cancer Research Campaign , which sponsored the research and published the paper in its British Journal of Cancer .
