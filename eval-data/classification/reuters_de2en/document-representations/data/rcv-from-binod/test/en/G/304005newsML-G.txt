a popular official of Germany &apos;s reform communist Party of Democratic Socialism ( PDS ) came under pressure to resign on Monday because of allegations he was an active spy for East Germany &apos;s notorious Stasi security police . 
Hanno Harnisch , the party &apos;s charismatic spokesman and one of its most colourful figures , conceded last week that he had been an unwilling informant for the Stasi since 1976 . 
but media reports on Monday indicated he had volunteered to become an active spy in 1971 . 
&quot; It is not good news for him , &quot; a PDS spokesman said . 
Harnisch said he did not plan to resign and denied he knowingly provided the Stasi with information before 1976 . 
der Spiegel news weekly and ARD television said they had documents showing Harnisch began filing detailed reports on his friends and dissidents in communist East Germany when he was 18 years old , and served as a border guard . 
&quot; It is certainly possible that when I first began serving as a border guard that there was someone from the Stasi taking down what I had to say , &quot; Harnisch told Reuters . 
Harnisch looked likely to come under severe pressure in the PDS , even though revelations about Stasi contacts are no longer the kiss of death they once were for eastern politicians . 
the pressure has eased after it dawned on easterners that hundreds of thousands of citizens spied on friends and neighbours . 
the popularity of one PDS mayoral candidate in Potsdam was even boosted by his admission he had once worked for the Stasi . 
but Harnisch &apos;s alleged transgression , at a time when the PDS is trying to project a young , trendy image to widen its appeal beyond disgruntled ex-communists , looked more damaging . 
&quot; He had no qualms about the use of weapons to stop border violators , &quot; said one Stasi report quoted by Der Spiegel . 
&quot; Harnisch has a solid political foundation ... and has shown himself to be devoted to the politics of the ( communist ) party and the ( East German ) government , &quot; read another 1971 Stasi report found by ARD . 
Harnisch said last week he had only signed up for the Stasi in 1976 after being threatened with ejection from university . 
Harnisch , 44 , owes much of his popularity to escapades such as an incident when , after going out drinking one night , he hot-wired an East German Trabant car outside a swanky West Berlin bars and used it to drive off to his home in the east . 
the car belonged to a well known theatre director who was out with a former Berlin mayor .
