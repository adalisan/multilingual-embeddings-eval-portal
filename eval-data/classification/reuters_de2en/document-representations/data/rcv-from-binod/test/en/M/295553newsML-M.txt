North Sea Brent crude spot and paper markets were steady in quiet trade on Thursday , but despite open arbitrage to the U.S. CFDs continued to flag a fall . 
traders said that despite pockets of demand for certain dates and a full second decade schedule of transatlantic fixtures , the third decade , although starting to move , still looked long . 
this was reflected by weakening CFDs with bids for next weeks dates pegged back to Feb Brent evens and offers down to Feb + 7 cents . 
a shipment of Brent has been fixed for Jan 25 to move to the U.S. Gulf , but traders noted that the movement of North Sea crude transatlantic was the result of a wide Brent / WTI spread rather than heavy Gulf Coast demand . 
however , dated Brent continued to hold around Feb Brent -20 cents its last traded level . 
Paper spread trading was dull with Jan / Feb expiring today and largely being ignored . 
Feb / March traded at + 54 cents . 
in the Mediterranean , most traders valued Urals steady at around dated - $ 1.10 despite rumours a small prompt cargo traded into Croatia on Wednesday at a firmer dated Brent - $ 1.02 CIF . 
but others said that an open transatlantic arbitrage and further loading disruptions at Novorossiisk indicated that differentials were likely to firm . 
at least two traders were heard working vessels to the U.S. Gulf Coast , with one offering Urals at Feb NYMEX crude - $ 1.65 CIF , U.S. refiners said . 
the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk was closed on Thursday due to high winds and heavy swell . 
an open U.S. arbitrage also underpinned differentials for West African crude . 
a delivered deal for third decade bonny Light / Medium combo cargo was heard struck on Wednesday .
