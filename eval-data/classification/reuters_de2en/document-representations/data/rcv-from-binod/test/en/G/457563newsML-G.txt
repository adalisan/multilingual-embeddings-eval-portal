the difficult issue of NATO enlargement tops the agenda when U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin meet in the Finnish capital on Thursday and Friday . 
following are the main points of the agenda : 
Russia bitterly opposes NATO &apos;s plans to take in new members from Central and Eastern Europe , saying it feels threatened and -- on the eve of the summit -- that it would be the West &apos;s biggest mistake since the end of the Cold War . 
the United States and its allies are trying to win Moscow &apos;s acceptance before a NATO summit in July which will invite several former Soviet bloc states to start membership talks , probably Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary . 
Yeltsin is trying to strike the best deal he can , by winning concessions from the West on security arrangements including arms control and future NATO deployments . 
under pressure from critics at home , he must not appear weak . 
Clinton is expected to try to reassure Yeltsin with a package ranging from arms control measures to support for greater Russian involvement in Western economic affairs . 
so far , however , there seems little hope of a breakthrough . 
at the heart of the discussion is a proposed NATO-Russia charter which will provide a permanent forum for consultation between the 16-nation alliance and Moscow . 
Russia wants to use the forum as a lever ; the West sees it as a way of involving Moscow in European security without giving it veto power over alliance decisions . 
Russia wants to lock NATO into legally-binding commitments on their future relationship , including a pledge not to station troops or nuclear weapons on the soil of new members . 
the West is unwilling to accept such commitments , although it has tried to reassure Russia over its military plans . 
Yeltsin also wants commitments NATO will not admit former Soviet republics , specifically the Baltic states . 
Washington insists the door must stay open for more countries to join . 
Yeltsin , having reshuffled his cabinet this week to tilt the balance towards reformers , has been warmly praised by Clinton for the move . 
Washington may offer more help in fighting organised crime and in moving Russia towards a market economy . 
Russia complains that it is unjustly excluded from key international bodies that deal with economic questions and Yeltsin is expected to seek greater U.S. support on this . 
U.S. officials say Russia will be given an expanded political role in the Group of Seven ( G7 ) , the most exclusive club of rich industrialised nations , although Moscow will not win full membership as it wants . 
Clinton may also be prepared to push harder for Russian entry into other fora such as the World Trade Organisation , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Paris Club , which discusses debt rescheduling . 
Helsinki will be important for a range of arms control issues , some of which are linked to Western attempts to reassure Russia about NATO enlargement . 
the two presidents will discuss changes to a 1990 treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe . 
NATO recently proposed major reforms of the Cold War-era agreement to reflect Russian concerns that it is outnumbered and outgunned now the Warsaw Pact has disappeared . 
the United States is pushing for a new round of nuclear missile reductions with Russia , but first wants the Russian parliament ( Duma ) to ratify the long-delayed START-2 treaty which was signed in 1993 . 
Communist and nationalist opponents of that treaty , which provides for reductions in long-range missiles , say it leaves Russia at a disadvantage and that it must spend vast sums in modernising its arsenal to keep up with the United States . 
Clinton is expected to outline some ways of reassuring the Russians on nuclear issues , in an attempt to get START-2 ratified before moving on to further and deeper cuts . 
the United States is also hoping to lay to rest a long-running dispute with Russia over a 1972 treaty on missile defences , so that the two countries can cooperate on the potential missile threat from other states that has been identified as one of the problems of the post-Cold War era . 
the two presidents may discuss the crisis in the Middle East peace process .
