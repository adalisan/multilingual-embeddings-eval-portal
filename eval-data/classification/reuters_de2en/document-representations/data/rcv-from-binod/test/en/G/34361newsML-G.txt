Boris Yeltsin &apos;s chief of staff Anatoly Chubais , with the clout of both the president and Russian big money behind him , appears to have taken the driving seat while his boss stays away . 
&quot; The feeling is growing by the day that Boris Yeltsin ... has left Anatoly Chubais in control and not ( prime minister ) Viktor Chernomyrdin , &quot; Tatyana Malkina wrote in Thursday &apos;s edition of the newspaper Sevodnya . 
under the Russian constitution , the prime minister takes over if the president dies or is incapacitated and a new presidential election must be held within three months . 
but Chubais has made clear this week he is monitoring both government actions and security chief Alexander Lebed &apos;s attempts to end the war in Chechnya . 
on Wednesday the former reform chief and mastermind of Russia &apos;s privatisation campaign attacked several economic decisions taken when he was on holiday , including a Yeltsin decree on taxation . 
Chubais said confidently they would be repealed or amended . 
hours later Chernomyrdin called in top ministers to work out what to do . 
Chubais is also guarding Yeltsin &apos;s interests while the 65-year-old president is secluded in a country residence . 
&quot; I must tell you we are coping ourselves , trying to cope , &quot; he told a news conference on Wednesday . 
but Chubais &apos;s current role as a guardian of Russian policy is unlikely to bring him top political office when Russians next go to the polls to choose a new president . 
the main challengers will probably be Lebed , Chernomyrdin , Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and communist Gennady Zyuganov . 
Chubais , deeply unpopular with those who say privatisation sold state property off for a song , does not seem a likely contender , although he could be a power broker , or maybe even a kingmaker for any candidate except Zyuganov . 
Chubais on Wednesday played down efforts by Lebed , Yeltsin &apos;s personal representative in Chechnya , to bring peace to the rebel region . 
&quot; One cannot say entirely that Lebed destroyed Russia and signed a capitulation , but one also cannot say that he deserves the Nobel prize , &quot; Interfax news agency quoted him as saying . 
he promised to release more information on what is happening to Yeltsin , who has effectively disappeared from the public eye since June 26 and is now on holiday at the Rus residence 100 km ( 60 miles ) northwest of Moscow . 
it will be a hard task , but analysts expect changes from Chubais , a workaholic with excellent organisational skills . 
he proved this during his unwavering privatisation drive and during Yeltsin &apos;s election campaign , when he sidelined Kremlin hawks . 
he , Yeltsin &apos;s daughter Tatyana and a team of intellectuals collected large sums of money and turned the Yeltsin campaign into an successful U.S-style meet-the-people enterprise . 
raising funds should not have been a problem as most of Russia &apos;s new capital emerged due to his privatisation campaign . 
some media reports said Chubais played an important secret organisational and financial role to help the outspoken Lebed , who was popular but had no political structure behind him , to finish a strong third in the first round . 
this helped to diminish support for Zyuganov . 
Chubais also cooperated closely with Luzhkov despite former bitter rows over privatisation in the Russian capital . 
initially trailing Zyuganov in opinion polls , Yeltsin closed the gap , won a second term in office and made Chubais his Chief-of-Staff and top aide . 
bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov , an influential hawk sacked by Yeltsin before the runoff vote after a clash with Chubais , said in a recent newspaper interview that Yeltsin was in charge of Russia but that he was heavily &quot; assisted &quot; -- from Chubais . 
&quot; Mr Chubais ... has become a regent to the live president and his utmost worry now is to set up his own regency in the Kremlin , &quot; he told Argumenty i Fakty weekly .
