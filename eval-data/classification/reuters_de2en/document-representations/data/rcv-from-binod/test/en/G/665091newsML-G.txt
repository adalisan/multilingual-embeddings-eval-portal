the mouthpiece of China &apos;s ruling Communist Party on Monday invoked history to cast aside any doubts that the British colony of Hong Kong had been anything other than Chinese territory for centuries . 
&quot; The annals of history are evidence that Hong Kong has been Chinese territory since ancient times , &quot; the People &apos;s Daily said in a front-page story , the first of a series of eight articles to celebrate China &apos;s resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 . 
in the year 221 BC , China &apos;s first emperor , Qinshihuang , created 36 prefectures , one of which administered Hong Kong , the newspaper said . 
bronze ware from China &apos;s Bronze Age had been unearthed in Hong Kong , it said citing further proof of China &apos;s historic claim to the territory . 
Britain took over Hong Kong as part of the &quot; unequal treaties &quot; signed after it defeated China in the 19th century opium wars , with the island of Hong Kong and the Kowloon peninsula held in perpetuity , while in 1898 the New Territories district was leased for 99 years . 
in 1984 , Britain agreed to hand back Hong Kong to China at midnight on June 30 , 1997 , after more than 150 years of colonial rule . 
poets of China &apos;s Tang dynasty ( AD 618-906 ) wrote about Hong Kong in their poems , the People &apos;s Daily said . 
most of Hong Kong &apos;s 6.4 million residents were of Chinese ancestry , including the territory &apos;s future leader Tung Chee-hwa , the late shipping magnate Sir Y.K. 
Pao and tycoon Li Ka-shing , the newspaper said . 
about four million of Hong Kong &apos;s residents were originally from China &apos;s southern province of Guangdong , it said . 
the newspaper credited the Communist Party for achieving what the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and 20th century warlords failed to achieve -- recovering Hong Kong . 
&quot; The Chinese government under the leadership of the Communist Party of China had the ability to end the humiliating history imperialists brought on the Chinese nation , &quot; it said . 
the newspaper urged Hong Kong Chinese not to forget British discrimination . 
the British introduced laws in 1882 banning Chinese from setting foot in high-class hotels , private clubs and the ritzy residential Peak district , the newspaper said . 
none of these laws applies today in Hong Kong . 
&quot; Hong Kong &apos;s new generation , the motherland &apos;s new generation and Chinese all over the world must not forget , &quot; the newspaper said . 
it sang the praises of Hong Kong residents for donating to Chinese flood victims in 1991 -- citing them as true patriots even before the handover . 
China and Hong Kong are like &quot; hands and feet , blood and tears ... Blood is thicker than water , &quot; it said . 
&quot; More than 100 years of British colonial rule is just a flash . 
Chinese blood and arteries forever joined together is history &apos;s inevitable result , &quot; the newspaper said .
