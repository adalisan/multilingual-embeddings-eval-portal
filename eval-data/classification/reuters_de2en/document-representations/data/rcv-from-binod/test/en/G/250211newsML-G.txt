President Hosni Mubarak on Wednesday dismissed Israeli charges of bias toward Palestinians and said Egypt could not be excluded from Middle East peace talks . 
Palestinian and Israeli officials had said on Tuesday Egypt &apos;s input in talks on a long-delayed Israeli handover of most of the West Bank city of Hebron to Palestinians has raised U.S. and Israeli ire . 
a senior Israeli official warned of &quot; confrontation &quot; between Israel and Egypt . 
&quot; These allegations that we are not balanced are not true , &quot; said Mubarak , whose nation in 1979 became the first Arab country to make peace with Israel . 
&quot; They want us to press on ( Palestinian President Yasser ) Arafat to accept their proposals whether the public opinion in Palestine agreed to it or not or whether Mr. Arafat finds it feasible or not . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s aide Dore Gold was due in Cairo on Wednesday . 
the Israeli official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the visit was intended to avert a visit by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to mediate in the Hebron dispute . 
&quot; Egypt instigated the peace process and our presence does not need permission , &quot; Mubarak told reporters . 
&quot; Egypt &apos;s role is there and you cannot live without it . 
Mubarak said Israel had requested Moussa &apos;s trip during a European security summit in Lisbon earlier this month . 
&quot; They asked the foreign minister to come and see what could be done and we have discussed the issue with Mr. Arafat , &quot; Mubarak said . 
&quot; So he ( Netanyahu ) sent Dore Gold to discuss it today . 
it is agreed upon . 
Mubarak said the criticism of Egypt was aimed at the ears of Israelis : &quot; I was shocked . 
it &apos;s bad after you have discussed something to then go home to Israel and say statements that are against all that you agreed upon . 
Egyptian-Israeli relations have been strained since the election in May of Netanyahu , who has rejected the concept of exchanging occupied Arab land for peace that formed the basis of peace talks since 1991 .
