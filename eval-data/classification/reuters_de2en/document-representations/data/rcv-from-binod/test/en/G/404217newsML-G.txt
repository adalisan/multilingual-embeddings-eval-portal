Brazil &apos;s Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday gave its second and final approval to a constitutional amendment that would allow President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for an unprecedented re-election next year . 
the amendment won 368 votes in the 513-member lower house of Congress , 60 more than the three-fifths majority needed and 32 more than when it was first approved in January . 
Cardoso is seeking to undo a ban on re-election that stretches back to the founding of the Brazilian republic in 1889 . 
the bill , which would also allow state governors and mayors to run for a second consecutive term , now advances to the Senate where it requires two more three-fifths majorities . 
Cardoso welcomed the vote on the bill , and urged Congress to make progress on structural reforms that have been held up for months . 
&quot; The president received news of the result with satisfaction and is confident the same kind of consensus will be repeated when it comes to voting on the reforms , &quot; presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral told reporters . 
reforms of the social security system and the civil service are considered crucial to the long-term success of the economic policies introduced by Cardoso to slash Brazil &apos;s previous runaway inflation to about 10 percent last year . 
but both were put on hold last year when the government focused all its attention on securing support for the controversial re-election bill from its delicate , multi-party alliance in Congress . 
the government &apos;s chief whip in the Chamber of Deputies , Benito Gama , speaking shortly after Tuesday &apos;s vote , said he expected the civil service reform to be put to its two votes in the lower house by the end of March . 
social security reform , which was approved in a watered-down form last year in the lower house , is currently being rewritten in the Senate to restore its most important points and could be put to a first vote within two months , officials said .
