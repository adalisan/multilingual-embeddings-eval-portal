troops loyal to newly-installed President Laurent Kabila allowed hundreds of his opponents to march through the Democratic Republic of Congo capital on Friday in defiance of a ban , witnesses said . 
the march was smaller than a Wednesday protest , broken up by soldiers firing automatic weapons , against the exclusion of veteran opponent Etienne Tshisekedi from the government and against the presence of Rwandan troops . 
a demonstration planned in support of Kabila fizzled out when only around 30 young men turned up . 
as the anti-Kabila protest passed through the working class Matonge district on the way to Tshisekedi &apos;s home , in the Limete suburb , it was followed by trucks full of dozens of troops . 
but they did not intervene . 
some bystanders said they would have joined in the protest , but were frightened off by the military presence . 
others in the poverty-ridden city said they could not afford to spend valuable time taking part in demonstrations . 
in the town centre business was as usual . 
shops and offices were open and the majority of bustling Kinshasa &apos;s five million people were unaffected by the march . 
&quot; There are those who want to march , but most people want to get on with their studies , &quot; 23-year-old civil aviation student Lambert Moamba told Reuters at the Superior Technical Institute , closed by troops on Wednesday . 
Kabila took office promising to hold elections by April 1999 and eradicate the legacy of ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko , who was driven out by a seven-month military campaign backed by Rwanda and Uganda . 
but among the tens of thousands of people who heard Kabila pledge democratic intentions were students who chanted slogans accusing him of trying to squash democracy and rule with the help of ethnic-Tutsi troops from Rwanda . 
&quot; It &apos;s up to the people to make Kabila go , &quot; Tshisekedi told about 2,000 militants outside his house on Thursday . 
&quot; If the people want to end dictatorship it is up to them and not me . 
Kabila &apos;s Alliance of Democratic Forces has banned political activity and public demonstrations , citing the need to preserve public order . 
on Wednesday , Kabila decreed himself sweeping powers to run the country until adoption of a new transitional constitution as part of the plan to hold elections by April 1999 . 
he said a two-year election timetable would be kept . 
the United States welcomed the timetable as a positive step and said a two-year transition was not unreasonable given the problems facing Congo . 
after more than three decades of misrule by Mobutu and a corrupt elite , the former Zaire , with vast reserves of copper , cobalt , zinc , gold , diamonds and other minerals , has been left as one of the poorest countries in the world . 
Kabila on Thursday pledged to rebuild the state by abolishing dual currency zones , aiming to defeat unemployment and improving transport networks across the vast nation . 
the U.N. Security Council , alarmed by reports of massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees , called on Thursday for an immediate end to violence against the exiles . 
investigators have so far been refused access to suspected mass graves by Kabila &apos;s army . 
state-run Congolese radio on Friday said Mobutu &apos;s former presidential jet , named after his birthplace town of Lisala , had been returned to Kinshasa from Brazzaville , the capital of neighbouring Congo , as the property of the state .
