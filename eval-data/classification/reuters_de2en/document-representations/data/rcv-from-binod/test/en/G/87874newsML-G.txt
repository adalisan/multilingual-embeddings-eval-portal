Nigeria &apos;s military ruler General Sani Abacha created six new states on Tuesday as part of his plan to restore democracy , but made no mention of freeing political detainees which some had expected . 
&quot; The principle adopted for the creation of states and local governments was to ensure a fair spread and balancing within the geopolitical zones of the country , &quot; Abacha said in a speech on the 36th anniversary of Nigeria &apos;s independence . 
the new states are shared equally between north and south of the ethnically divided country , making a total of 36 states . 
creation of states is the next step on the plan to return Africa &apos;s most populous nation to civilian rule by October 1998 . 
on Monday the electoral commission announced the five parties that will be allowed to take part in that process , out of 15 that applied . 
all are from the centre ground , and none are opponents of the government . 
&quot; No political association that is critical of the military government appears to have been successful , &quot; political activist Ajibade Idowu said . 
since independence from Britain in 1960 , Nigeria has spent less than 10 years under civilian rule . 
Nigerian opposition groups and Western governments , demanding Abacha hand over power earlier , remain unimpressed with the transition programme . 
Abacha &apos;s government is seen as a pariah by much of the international community , for holding dozens of opposition figures in detention and the execution last November of nine minority rights activists , including author Ken Saro-Wiwa . 
but Nigeria insists it will follow its own course . 
the Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies , which suspended Nigeria after the November executions , on Sunday decided not to impose sanctions to force the pace of democracy , but said it would send a fact-finding team instead . 
they also dropped a previous insistence that fact-finders would have to meet opposition and human rights groups . 
&quot; We welcome their decision to come to Nigeria and attend a meeting between the Commonwealth and Nigeria and we look forward to the meeting , &quot; said foreign minister Tom Ikimi . 
&quot; Nigeria has not been standing still , a lot of changes have taken place in the country during the past year . 
the last democratic experiment ended when a previous military government annulled the results of 1993 presidential elections , plunging the country into political crisis . 
the presumed winner of that election , millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola has been detained since 1994 when he declared himself president on the basis of the results . 
&quot; Contrary to popular expectation no mention was made of the release of political detainees , &quot; The Punch newspaper said in commentary on the independence day speech . 
the five parties qualifying for registration were headed by the United Nigeria Congress Party of Yahaya Gusau , a veteran conservative from the North who frowns on radical change . 
also successful was the National Centre Party of Nigeria , led by former oil minister Don Etiebet from a minority ethnic group in the oil-producing southeast . 
other qualifiers were the Committee for National Consensus , the Democratic Party of Nigeria and the grassroot Democratic Movement . 
but among those which failed to win registration were the People &apos;s Progressive Party , largely made up of opponents of the military from the National Democratic Coalition ( NADECO ) . 
NADECO , with its southwestern heartland , has campaigned for Abacha to respect the results of the 1993 elections .
