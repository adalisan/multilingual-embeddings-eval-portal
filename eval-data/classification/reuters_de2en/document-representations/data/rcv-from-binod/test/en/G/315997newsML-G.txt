Cambodia started direct telecommunications links to Canada and the United States Friday with the commissioning of a new earth station . 
the F3 Satellite Earth Station was installed by Australia &apos;s Telstra Corp. under a business cooperation contract with Cambodia &apos;s Ministry of posts and Telecommunications . 
the new station provides Cambodia with access to Pacific Ocean satellites . 
it supplies direct links to the United States and Canada , while links to other Pacific nations can be opened when required . 
&quot; I hope the improvement in the telecommunications quality to the USA and Canada from today and the reduced tariff rates from Feb . 1 will enhance all relationships , including business , between our two countries , &quot; said MPTC Secretary of State So Khun .
