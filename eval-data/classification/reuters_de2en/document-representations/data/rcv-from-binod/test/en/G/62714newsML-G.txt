a lovesick Australian has tied himself to a traction rope supporting his girlfriend &apos;s skull in a bizarre hospital siege which has lasted two days , Perth police said on Wednesday . 
doctors fear any sudden movement by the unarmed man could ruin the woman &apos;s chances of recovering from spinal injuries sustained in a car crash and risk leaving her paralysed . 
Ivan Garvan , 31 , on Monday used his jumper to tie himself to the halo traction rope which supports a metal ring screwed into his 29-year-old girlfriend &apos;s skull , police said . 
the traction equipment holds the unidentified woman &apos;s head still , immobilising her damaged spinal column . 
Garvan has not slept nor had any food or water since the siege began on Monday in the spinal ward of the Royal Perth Rehabilitation Hospital in Western Australia state . 
&quot; It appears to be a relationship gone wrong and he just wants to be with her , &quot; Perth police superintendent David Parkinson told reporters on Wednesday . 
&quot; This without doubt would be the most unusual incident that this police service has ever encountered , &quot; Parkinson said .
