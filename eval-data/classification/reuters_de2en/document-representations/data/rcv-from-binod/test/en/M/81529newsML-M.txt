* T-bond futures seen choppy ahead of next Friday &apos;s September U.S. jobs data . 
* December T-bonds need to hold above 109-00 support to maintain positive momentum . 
* December eurodollars need to break cleanly above 94.28 August high to confirm confidence that there will be no credit tightening this year . 
U.S. Treasury bond futures , which have made handsome gains this week , will likely see choppy trading in the coming days as the market prepares for next Friday &apos;s September U.S. jobs data , analysts said . 
&quot; Next week is a big week of economic releases , and this market is in a number-to-number mode , &quot; said Charles Ovis , manager of global trading at EVEREN Securities . 
&quot; It creates an extremely volatile trading environment that is difficult to trade short-term , but the overall technical make-up in the market is fairly strong , &quot; he added . 
&quot; We &apos;ll go into next Friday &apos;s unemployment number probably towards the top of this range , and if we get anything below the forecast ( in non-farm payrolls ) we &apos;ll have a shot to break the 6-3 / 4 ( percent in the long bond yield ) , &quot; he noted . 
according to a recent Reuters survey , economists on average expect a gain of 192,000 in non-farm payrolls against August &apos;s 250,000 gain . 
Ovis saw 109-00 in December T-bond futures , which was an important peak prior to last Tuesday &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee Meeting , as a key support level in maintaining the market &apos;s bullish momentum . 
Michael Zentz , director of fixed income at Pegasus econometrics Group , said the 109-area also represented a 62 percent retracement of the August-September decline . 
to extend gains and test new highs , the bond market , besides resolving overbought conditions in momentum indicators , needed to see the shorter end of the curve show confidence in further pricing out any future Fed rate hikes , Zentz said . 
he said he wanted the December eurodollar futures to climb well above 94.28 August high . 
&quot; If I were to see them trade eight pips above that -- a clean breakout -- I would have to suspect that the market is comfortable pricing out that other 25 basis points and the short end won &apos;t be a drag to the long end , &quot; he said . 
&quot; On a breakout , maybe I &apos;ll have to abandon the swing trading mode I &apos;ve been in all summer and start to wonder if we &apos;re not trending , &quot; he added . 
fundamentally , Ovis at EVEREN said a slower second half economic growth forecast by the Fed could be starting to materialize and that there was a healthy inflow of foreign capital into the bond market .
