KCBT hard red winter wheat futures ended higher Thursday on short covering before a USDA stocks and planting report and strong export data , traders said . 
&quot; It was just a continuation of the short covering that we saw yesterday ( Wednesday ) , one floor trader said . 
&quot; Nobody wants to be short in front of the report . 
KCBT wheat settled up 5-1 / 2 to 7-1 / 4 cents per bushel with May up 7-1 / 4 at $ 4.28-3 / 4 , and July up 7-1 / 2 at $ 4.02 
on Monday , the U.S. Department of Agriculture will release wheat planting and quarterly grain stocks data . 
many traders anticipate the report to be bullish for wheat futures , they said . 
analysts &apos; pre-report estimates on the USDA report for acreage of all U.S. wheat averaged 70.10 million acres in a range of 69.25 million to 71.01 million . 
the estimate was well below 75.64 million acres planted to wheat last year , according to USDA data . 
strong weekly export sales of 497,000 tonnes from USDA also spurred buying , traders said . 
that figure exceeded trade expectations for 100,000 to 300,000 tonnes . 
traders noted that commercial firms and commodity funds were also moderate buyers Thursday . 
there was options-related buying also , traders said . 
on the day , Benson-Quinn bought six million bushels May and 1.5 million July .
