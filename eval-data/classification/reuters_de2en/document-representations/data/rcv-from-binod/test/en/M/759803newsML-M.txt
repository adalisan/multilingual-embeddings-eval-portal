SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures backed off their recent highs in thin , featureless trade on Monday but dealers said any falls would be limited . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) is going to hike rates at least till end of the year , &quot; a senior dealer at a Japanese brokerage said . 
he said the market was pricing in steady rates until the middle of next year but added that this could change abruptly if the BOJ &apos;s next quarterly business sentiment survey showed unexpected optimism . 
the dealer said the contract needed to breach resistance at 99.15 to head higher . 
September JGBs ended at 125.79 against a previous 125.91 . 
&quot; I think the market should be stuck around this range waiting for the industrial output data on Wednesday , &quot; a trader at a U.S. house said . 
Japan &apos;s industrial output is expected to have fallen 2.8 percent in June from the previous month after rising 4.5 percent in May , according to economists &apos; forecasts . 
Eurodollar futures shuffled about in a narrow band ahead of the U.S. second quarter employment cost index , due Tuesday . 
December Eurodollars ended at 94.120 against their IMM close at 94.125 on volume of 4,710 lots .
