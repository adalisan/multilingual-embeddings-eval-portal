Hong Kong stocks are expected to rally their way into the 1997 handover , with the Hang Seng index hitting record levels by the time the territory reverts to Chinese rule on midnight of June 30 , 1997 , a Reuter poll found . 
analysts polled by Reuters said 12,000 points was well within reach by the end of the year for the Hang Seng and an improving economy in 1997 should ensure continued strength . 
&quot; earnings per share growth will be the major factor , &quot; said Alex Tang , head of research at Yamaichi International . 
he predicted the Hang Seng index would reach 13,000 points by the end of this year and 14,000 by the end of June 1997 . 
&quot; We believe that earnings per share growth in 1997 will be 14 percent compared with 12 percent this year . 
we are looking at a price earnings ( PE ) ratio of 15 times this year , if the index reaches 13,000 , and with the same PE ratio in 1997 we should see 14,000 next year , &quot; Tang said . 
the Hang Seng index hit a new 1996 intra-day peak on Friday at 11,788.41 before closing at a 31-month high of 11,759.39 , up 123.26 points . 
the index reached an all-time intra-day high of 12,599.23 on January 4 , 1994 and ended at a record 12,201.09 that day . 
analysts said so-called &quot; China factors &quot; were also improving . 
&quot; Credit easing in China will indirectly benefit the profitability of those companies in Hong Kong which have exposure to the China market , &quot; said Ben Kwong , director of research at Dharmala Securities . 
he said the Hang Seng index could reach 12,300 to 12,500 before the end of the year and 13,800 points by the handover . 
&quot; There is some linkage with the handover . 
China has always emphasized that it will try to keep Hong Kong prosperous so that means they will have a policy that will benefit the Hong Kong economy , &quot; said Kwong . 
Peter Churchouse , regional strategist at Morgan Stanley , said liquidity from China will also boost the market . 
&quot; easier interest rates and funds from China into Hong Kong for all sorts of things including property , business start ups and just a very strong demand for basic space and services in Hong Kong from PRC ( People &apos;s Republic of China ) organisations ( will fuel the rise ) , &quot; he said . 
Churchouse forecast the Hang Seng would be around 15,000 points one year from now . 
by the end of this year , he predicted the blue chip index should reach 12,850 . 
however , analysts were not unanimous in their forecasts and Philip Niem , head of research at HSBC James Capel , predicted a volatile year in 1997 with the Hang Seng index trading below current levels at the mid-1997 handover at around 11,500 points . 
the future direction of economic policy will not be totally defined , &quot; he said . 
Alan Hutcheson , director of research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , expected a rally in the early part of next year but said he was unsure how sustainable it would be . 
&quot; I actually think it is going to be extremly difficult to predict what happens to the market after the first quarter of next year , &quot; he said . 
Robin Hammond , Hong Kong research director at Asia Equity , said investors may choose to seek better returns elsewhere . 
he saw the Hang Seng index at 12,350 by the end of this year and 13,000 by June 1997 . 
&quot; Frankly , I think we have probably had the best of the rally , &quot; he said . 
the following are analysts &apos; forecasts for the Hang Seng index at the end of this year , the end of June 1997 and the end of September 1997 :
