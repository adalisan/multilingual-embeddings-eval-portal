anticipating a line of attack from Republican Bob Dole , President Bill Clinton on Saturday disclosed details of a controversial memo on the drug war that Republicans claim is critical of his leadership . 
taking a break from his preparations to debate Dole on Sunday , Clinton told reporters the confidential memo by Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh simply argued for a reorganization of responsibilities within the government . 
&quot; It was a memo by Mr. Louis Freeh to me arguing that the federal government had never been properly organised in terms of who had jurisdiction to do what in the drug war , &quot; Clinton said . 
&quot; He argues for a reallocation of authority and I thought argued quite persuasively that we needed a way to coordinate this , &quot; Clinton said in a brief talk with reporters in this remote , lakeside town in western New York state . 
Clinton has refused to give the memo to congressional Republicans , claiming the legal doctrine of executive privilege . 
on Saturday , he seemed to suggest that the memo merely went over ground that had long been discussed within the U.S. government , saying : &quot; This issue has been debated literally going back to the Johnson administration . 
in commenting on the letter , Clinton was clearly trying to deflect criticism from Republicans , including Dole , that his administration had not done enough to fight drugs . 
Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour called on Clinton on Saturday to make Freeh &apos;s memo public and said the White House had not been telling the truth about its handling of confidential FBI files on former Republican officeholders , the so-called Filegate scandal . 
&quot; The Filegate scandal has proven the country cannot expect the truth from this White House , &quot; he said in a statement . 
&quot; That &apos;s why it is crucial for the FBI / DEA memo to be made public , so the people can judge its importance themselves . 
dole has made drugs a central theme of his campaign , often citing statistics that teen drug use has risen under Clinton , and running a string of television advertisements attacking the president on the issue . 
the Dole ads make a point of noting that at the start of his presidency Clinton sharply reduced the office of the drug policy director as part of his effort to reduce government spending . 
about three years later Clinton restored funds for the office and named Barry McCaffrey , a heavily decorated army general , to lead it . 
&quot; One of the reasons that I wanted a general who had worked on drug interdiction as drug Czar was to try to create a greater sense of coordination between the domestic law enforcement agencies , the military and all the people involved in the prevention and treatment side , &quot; he said . 
the Clinton campaign has about two dozen advisers gathered here to help him prepare for the 90-minute debate , which will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Sunday ( 0100 GMT on Monday ) in Hartford , Connecticut . 
the second , and final , debate between the two men before the Nov . 5 election is scheduled for Wednesday Oct . 16 in San Diego , California . 
although national opinon polls show he leads Dole by 10-20 percentage points , Clinton has been playing an old political game by playing down his debating prowess to lower expectations in the debate . 
on Thursday he claimed to be &quot; apprehensive &quot; and on Friday he said former Maine Senator George Mitchell , who was impersonating Dole in Clinton &apos;s practice sessions , had &quot; beat me like a drum . 
asked on Saturday whether he had finally got the better of Mitchell , Clinton replied , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know . 
Clinton will be joined by his wife Hillary on Saturday afternoon at the 750-acre ( 303 hectare ) retreat where he has secluded himself for three days to focus on the debate . 
on Sunday morning he will fly to Hartford , and take a tour of the debate hall in the afternoon to familiarize himself with its layout before the cameras start rolling on Sunday night .
