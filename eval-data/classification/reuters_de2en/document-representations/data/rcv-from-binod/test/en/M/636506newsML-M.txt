the Polish zloty slowly inched up against the basket of currencies in early Wednesday trade and players expected the National Bank of Poland ( NBP ) to intervene against the local currency later today . 
&quot; If the zloty strenghtens past 1.5 percent from parity the NBP will most likely intervene ... and the zloty is probably headed for higher levels today , &quot; said Malgorzata Sawicka , forex dealer at Bank Handlowy SA . 
dealers said the market &apos;s recent pro-zloty sentiment as well as foreign entry prospects at today &apos;s fixed bond auction would give the zloty a boost on Wednesday . 
it was at 3.2270 / 80 to the dollar against opening &apos;s 3.2260 / 90 and at 1.8628 / 33 to the mark against 1.8625 / 45 . 
late on Tuesday , Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s affirmed Poland &apos;s BBB- long-term foreign currency rating and its A- long-term local currency rating , while reviving the outlook to positive from stable on both ratings . 
it also affirmed the A-1 short-term local currency rating and assigned the A-3 short-term foreign currency rating . 
&quot; The ratings could be better but these results fall within market expectations . 
&quot; upward pressure on the zloty may even increase slightly on the rating update , &quot; he added . 
one-day rates stabilised around 22.5 percent on Wednesday after the central bank refrained from staging any drainages . 
at 0910 GMT overnight rates were at 22.30 / 22.50 percent , donw from 22.40 / 22.65 at opening and tomorrow / next were at 22.40 / 22.50 percent against Tuesday &apos;s close at 22.30 / 22.60 .
