the dollar showed a firmer bias in Asian trading but will have trouble scaling any key levels ahead of the U.S. non-farm payrolls data for July , due later on Friday , Singapore dealers said . 
they said the dollar had been lifted by U.S. fund buying from the 118.55 / 60 yen level just after lunch but exporter offers were expected near the key technical 119.00 yen . 
&quot; On the the first try , it probably won &apos;t go to 119 yen . 
it will come off a bit but I think it will go through after the ( payrolls ) figure , &quot; a European bank dealer said . 
the consensus forecast in a Reuters survey calls for a non-farm payrolls figure of 193,000 in July versus 217,000 in June , while the overall unemployment rate is expected to edge down 0.1 point to 4.9 percent . 
activity in dollar / mark was largely a function of the mark crosses but dealers said there appeared to be some dollar sell orders around 1.8440 / 50 marks . 
&quot; Above the 1.8450 mark level , I believe there are some stop-loss buy orders . 
the market still wants to long the dollar . 
people are looking at 1.90 eventually , &quot; the dealer said .
