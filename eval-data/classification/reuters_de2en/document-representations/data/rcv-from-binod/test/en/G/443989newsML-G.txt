women who take hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) after menopause considerably increase their risk of getting a blood clot , but only in the first year , Spanish researchers reported on Friday . 
they said their findings were being used to revise guidelines for doctors , who have been anxious about the risks of blood clots in using the drugs . 
Susanne Perez Gutthann and colleagues of the Centro Espanol de Investigation Farmaco-epidemiologica at Madrid &apos;s Complutense University looked at the medical records of nearly 350,000 women who had seen British doctors . 
the computer database of British general practitioners provided a convenient research tool . 
they found that in women not using HRT , the risk of a blood clot which can cause a heart attack or embolism in the lung , is 1.3 per 10,000 women each year . 
for those using HRT , the risk was much higher in the first year -- between four and five times higher during the first six months of therapy and triple in the second six months . 
&quot; This increased risk was restricted to first-year users , &quot; they wrote in a report in the British Medical Journal . 
they found no differences between users of high and low-dose preparations , or between those taking pills and those using patches . 
the study , which they said was probably the largest such study so far , produced results consistent with other research . 
HRT is prescribed not only to battle symptoms of the menopause , but to prevent osteoporosis -- a weakening of the bones caused by calcium loss . 
it also is known to reduce the risk of heart disease .
