Carl Hooper took five wickets to lead a West Indies fightback on the rain-hit second day of the second test against Sri Lanka on Saturday . 
Off-spinner Hooper , top scorer with 81 in a paltry first innings score of 147 , sent Sri Lanka tumbling to 222 all out after they had resumed at 157 for three . 
West Indies &apos;s only success in a shortened morning session came when Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga edged Courtney Walsh to Brian Lara at slip . 
the innings went into decline after opener Sanath Jayasuriya fell for 90 to the second delivery after lunch . 
that left Sri Lanka on 185 for five . 
he offered no stroke to a delivery from Hooper and was adjudged leg before by umpire Steve Bucknor . 
Jayusuriya batted for 185 minutes , faced 148 balls and struck 11 fours . 
Hooper went on to mop up the tail , the last four wickets falling for just 11 runs , to finish with the remarkable figures of five for 26 from 13.4 overs . 
a further lengthy stoppage for rain left West Indies &apos;s openers Sherwin Campbell and Stuart Williams just four overs to negotiate before the close . 
they knocked 19 runs off the first innings deficit of 75 . 
West Indies won the first test in Antigua by six wickets .
