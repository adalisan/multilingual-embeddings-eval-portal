the European Union urged Israel for the first time on Wednesday to consider allowing the creation of a Palestinian state . 
in a statement adopted at their Amsterdam summit , EU leaders said : &quot; Europe calls on the people of Israel to recognise the right of the Palestinians to exercise self-determination , without excluding the option of a state . 
&quot; The creation of a viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian entity is the best guarantee of Israel &apos;s security , &quot; the 15-nation bloc said . 
at the same time , the EU called on the Palestinian people to reaffirm their commitment to the ligitimate right of Israel to live within safe , recognised borders . 
the &quot; European Call for Peace in the Middle East &quot; warned that stagnation on the Palestinian , Syrian and Lebanese negotiating tracks &quot; is a permanent threat to the security of all &quot; and urged the peoples and governments of the Middle East to renew talks . 
it recalled the internationally agreed foundations for peace including the exchange of land for peace , the non-acceptability of the annexation of territory by force , rejection of terrorism , Palestinian self-determination and the right of all states and peoples to live in safe , recognised borders . 
the EU reaffirmed its opposition to settlements and support for Arab-Israeli security cooperation . 
it backed mediation efforts by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to revive Israeli- Palestinian peace talks and pledged to support his initiative . 
the new departure of the European statement appeared to reflect deep frustration at the approach of hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , whose decision to build a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem led to a breakdown of talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
paradoxically , it was issued in the midst of a marathon EU summit in which the bloc &apos;s leaders failed to agree on reforming their own institutions and postponed key decisions to the future . 
&quot; It is vital to abstain from unilateral actions prejudging the permanent status issues and to resume and maintain full security cooperation with the aim of fighting terrorism , &quot; the EU said . 
&quot; It is time to take concrete steps towards a lasting peace , &quot; the statement said . 
previous EU resolutions , beginning with the landmark Venice Declaration in 1980 , Europe &apos;s first unsuccessful venture into Middle East peacemaking , had upheld the Palestinians &apos; right to self-determination without specifically calling for a state . 
the last major EU policy statement in Florence last June referred to &quot; self-determination for the Palestinians , with all that it implies &quot; , but stopped short of mentioning a state . 
Israeli leaders have long told the EU that by calling publicly for a Palestinian state , they were prejudging the outcome of negotiations and taking sides in the Arab-Israeli dispute in a way that disqualified Europe as an honest broker . 
Arab states have looked to the Europeans to balance out a perceived United States bias towards the Jewish state and to press Washington to take a more active role in breaking the deadlock in the peace process .
