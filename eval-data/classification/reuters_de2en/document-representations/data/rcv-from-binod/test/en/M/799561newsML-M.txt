Orange juice prices dropped sharply on Thursday after a forecast by a private consulting firm predicted a much larger than expected orange crop this year in Florida . 
in other markets , soybean prices fell on forecasts for rain later this week in dry areas of the Midwest and most oil prices closed lower on profit-taking after this week &apos;s rally in gasoline . 
at the New York Cotton Exchange , frozen concentrated orange juice for September delivery dropped 9.60 cents a pound to close at 69.65 cents , its lowest level since February 1993 . 
triggering the selloff was a private forecast for the coming Florida crop of 253 million 90-pound boxes of oranges by citrus Consulting International . 
last year Florida produced 225.7 million boxes out of a total U.S. crop of 299.1 million boxes . 
the estimate , issued to the consulting firms clients , circulated widely among traders early on Thursday . 
a spokeswoman for citrus Consulting declined to confirm or deny the estimate , but analysts said the firm &apos;s president , Elizabeth Steger , enjoyed wide respect in the industry . 
&quot; She &apos;s trained at this and she does it methodically , &quot; said Philip Lesser , an economist with the Florida Department of citrus , adding that Steger &apos;s clients allow her to survey their groves and count each tree limb . 
at the Chicago Board of Trade , forecasts for more rain in dry Midwest crop areas this week and signs of lackluster exports pushed soybean prices lower . 
soybeans for September delivery closed down 4-1 / 2 cents a bushel at $ 6.55-1 / 2 . 
weather forecasts on Thursday called for widespread weekend rains of one-quarter to 1-1 / 2 inches in the Corn Belt states from Ohio to Iowa , meteorologists said . 
that outlook tempered recent concerns about moisture deficiency as soybeans set and fill pods . 
&quot; With the rains we had last week and the rains that are forecast , we are probably going to have a record crop , &quot; said Tim Hannagan , head grain analyst with Alaron Trading Corp. 
&quot; The government came out on Tuesday and predicted a 2.7 billion bushel crop , &quot; he added , noting that the Agriculture Department estimate was a record high . 
&quot; We &apos;ve had ample rain falling over the driest areas since then . 
the trade assumes on the next report they &apos;re going to increase it even more , &quot; Hannagan said . 
traders cited lower than expected weekly exports of soybeans as another reason to sell . 
the Agriculture Department reported that sales totalled only 193,000 metric tons in the week ended August 7 . 
traders had expected up to 350,000 tons . 
weak exports also weighed on the corn market , which had been buoyant since the government on Tuesday shaved 500 million bushels from its monthly forecast of this year &apos;s corn crop , citing dry weather in July . 
prices of December corn had gained 13 cents since the report but closed up only 1-1 / 2 cents on Thursday as $ 2.68 . 
weekly corn exports showed weak demand , with bookings for the year starting in September 1 only 160,100 tons , below trade expectations for 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange , most prices ended lower as traders took profits by selling futures contracts following two straight days of gains . 
but gasoline , the market leader this week on concerns about refinery shutdowns and tight stocks at the end of the summer driving season , eked out a gain . 
gasoline for September delivery closed 0.25 cent a gallon higher at 66.33 cents . 
&quot; The market looks bullish longer term , but today is an expected pullback since we had risen more than four cents in the last two days in gasoline , &quot; said Sal Gugliara of United Energy in New York . 
Exxon &apos;s shutdown of a gasoline-making unit at its big Baytown , Texas , refinery on Wednesday had lifted prices strongly at a time when industry reports show U.S. gasoline stockpiles continuing to fall . 
crude oil stocks , however , continue to rise . 
crude oil for September delivery closed down 11 cents a barrel at $ 20.08 and September heating oil ended 0.17 cent lower at 55.87 cents a gallon .
