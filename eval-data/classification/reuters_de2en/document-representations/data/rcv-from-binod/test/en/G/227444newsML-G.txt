mother Teresa was in critical condition on Sunday and long-standing lung and renal diseases forced doctors to postpone treatment with drugs to correct an irregular heart rhythm , a medical bulletin said . 
&quot; Mother Teresa up to this moment remains in critical condition , &quot; the bulletin , issued at 12.45 p.m. ( 0715 GMT ) , said . 
&quot; Even though the ischaemia of the heart has been corrected , her heart rhythm is still irregular . 
her long-standing lung and renal diseases continue to be a major concern , which could complicate heart condition and recovery , &quot; it added . 
Chatterjee , administrator of the B.M. 
Birla Heart Research Centre in Calcutta , told reporters doctors had postponed treatment of her irregular heart rhythm with drugs . 
a bulletin issued earlier on Sunday by the centre said her condition was stable and that she was &quot; comfortable and cheerful &quot; . 
mother Teresa , the 86-year-old Roman Catholic missionary , known as the &quot; Saint of the gutters &quot; for her work with the world &apos;s poor , underwent surgery on Friday to remove blockages in two coronary arteries .
