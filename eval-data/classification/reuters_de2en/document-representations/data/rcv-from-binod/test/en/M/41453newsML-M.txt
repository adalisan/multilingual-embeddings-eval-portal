Millfeed markets were quiet to start the week , with many dealers reporting a lack of inquiries Monday . 
corn harvesting in southern Illinois and southern Missouri may create some light pressure on millfeed values , dealers said . 
however , the greatest price pressure should occur when harvest moves further north in late September and October . 
Carolina sources reported some smaller feedmills were still without electrical power early Monday in the wake of Hurricane Fran , which hit the area late last week . 
&quot; Most of the big mills are probably operating , &quot; one said . 
North Texas dealers said prices for October to March positions were under pressure from corn . 
corn prices dropped last week , creating price competition for millfeeds , he said . 
North Texas millfeed was offered $ 132 per ton for October-December and $ 130 for January-March versus $ 137 and $ 135 , respectively , late last week .
