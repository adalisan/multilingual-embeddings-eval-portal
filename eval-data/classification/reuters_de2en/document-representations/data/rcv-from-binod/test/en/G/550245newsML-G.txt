Guatemala &apos;s truth commission has been entrusted with investigating 36 years of dirty war massacres and assassinations but given too little money to do its work , its director said . 
German law professor Christian Tomuschat , head of the commission , told Reuters the panel will not be able to start work as scheduled in June unless it gets more funding . 
&quot; We can start if we get just a part of the money we need , &quot; he said . 
leftist Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit ( URNG ) rebels and the government signed an agreement in December that ended 36 years of civil war . 
international donors have promised more than $ 1 billion to fulfil the accords but the government has earmarked only $ 50,000 for the commission . 
&quot; $ 50,000 is , of course , very little . 
it was clear the commission would entail a much bigger cost , &quot; said Tomuschat , who has met ambassadors from Europe and the United States to ask for $ 8 million in donations . 
he said the government has talked about giving the peace commission more money but has done nothing . 
Members of the government &apos;s presidential peace secretariat , which oversees the peace budget , were not available for comment . 
under terms of the accords signed on Dec . 29 the three-member commission -- the other two members are Guatemalan -- will spend between six and 12 months documenting human rights violations . 
even though it has not yet started its work , the commission is already a source of controversy in the country , where an estimated 100,000 people died and another 40,000 disappeared during the fighting . 
human rights leaders and relatives of the victims have criticised the commission because of its mandate says it should not &quot; individualize responsibility &quot; -- a euphemism for naming those responsible for abuse . 
many victims blame high-ranking members of the military and want the commission to name names . 
but army leaders have made it clear that to them the spirit of the accords meant &quot; you should not put names in the report , &quot; Tomuschat said . 
&quot; Institutional responsibility must be clearly indicated ... but if we only said it was the army , or the URNG , probably that would be too little , &quot; he said . 
the commission also will try to determine the real number of victims . 
&quot; We should at least make an attempt at verifying those numbers . 
Tomuschat called the investigation of 36 years of war in less than a year an &quot; almost impossible &quot; task for the small commission . 
but he said it will use testimony gathered previously by the Catholic church and other groups .
