U.S. farmers will grow their fourth-largest corn crop ever this year , the government estimated Wednesday , but it still will not be big enough to fatten the nation &apos;s depleted stockpiles or tame volatile markets . 
in its first forecast since the fall harvest began , the Agriculture Department pegged the corn crop at 8.8 billion bushels , up 109 million bushels from the August estimate . 
the soybean crop , at 2.27 billion bushels , would be No . 
2 in the record books but barely meet U.S. needs until next fall . 
the cotton crop was downgraded to 17.4 million bales , nearly 700,000 bales less than expected a month ago . 
thanks to an upturn in the spring wheat crop , the U.S. wheat output was boosted to 2.3 billion bushels , up 50 million bushels . 
&quot; You &apos;re still looking at a very tight ( grain ) supply situation , &quot; said Mike Hoover of the WEFA Group in suburban Philadelphia . 
&quot; Increasing the ( corn ) crop helps a little but it &apos;s not a saviour yet by any means . 
economist John Schnittker of the consumer group Public Voice for Food and Health Policy said the United States and the world remain short of grain , with little hope of gaining breathing room until next year &apos;s crops are harvested . 
&quot; These crops are going to build stocks slightly but still leave them half of the level needed for price stability , &quot; Schnittker said , adding that an early frost would damage the late-planted corn and soybean crops . 
grain prices fell sharply at the Chicago Board of Trade in response to the government forecasts . 
corn for December delivery closed at $ 3.26-3 / 4 a bushel , down 7-1 / 2 cents . 
November soybeans fell 2 cents to $ 8.05 . 
December wheat fell 15-1 / 4 cents to $ 4.37-1 / 2 . 
agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the corn crop was &quot; pretty much on target &quot; and , while stocks would be tight , there was &quot; nothing catastrophic at all &quot; to be expected . 
robust wheat crops in other nations meant &quot; We &apos;re going to have more competitive wheat markets next year , &quot; Glickman said . 
exports were forecast for 925 million bushels , down 50 million bushels from what was estimated last month . 
U.S. grain and soybean prices have run at sky-high levels for two years due to tight supplies worldwide and voracious demand . 
the world is harvesting a mammoth wheat crop this year , along with an upturn in feed ( coarse ) grains . 
the Agriculture Department estimates were based on conditions on Sept . 1 and did not take into account damage from Hurricane Fran last week in North Carolina . 
the department said warm August weather was a blessing that improved crop conditions , although corn and soybeans are far behind their usual pace in maturity . 
yield prospects improved for corn in Iowa , Illinois and Nebraska , the three leading states , but worsened in Ohio and Wisconsin . 
the U.S. average was forecast at 120.2 bushels an acre , compared with 113.5 last year and the 118.7 in August . 
at 8.8 billion bushels , the U.S. corn crop would keep exports at a high level and sustain domestic meat output . 
there would be 668 million bushels of corn on hand when next year &apos;s crop was ready for harvest , a paltry level by usual standards but better than the 409 million bushels available at the start of this month . 
soybeans , which are also behind the normal development pace , were projected at lower yields than thought a month ago in the country &apos;s No . 
1 and 2 producing states of Iowa and Illinois . 
soybean yield projections also dropped in the key states of Minnesota and Ohio . 
the U.S. average was forecast as 35.8 bushels an acre .
