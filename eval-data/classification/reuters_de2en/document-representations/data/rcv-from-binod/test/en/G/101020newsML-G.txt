demolition work began on Monday on the &quot; House of horrors &quot; where serial killers Fred and Rosemary West tortured , murdered and buried a string of young girls and women in one of Britain &apos;s most gruesome crimes . 
three of the surviving children of the Wests , whose victims included two of their children , laid a spray of flowers outside 25 , Cromwell Street where nine bodies were buried in the garden and cellar . 
&quot; The sad memories of this house will go with it -- but the memories of you will always stay &quot; , read a message with the flowers in a tribute to 16-year-old heather , the Wests &apos; eldest child who died at the hands of her mother and father . 
Council officials say every element of the house , including bricks , floorboards and fittings , will be destroyed to stop ghoulish souvenir hunters descending on Britain &apos;s most notorious address . 
police are mounting a 24-hour guard on the 19th century three-storey terraced house in this western English city . 
the local council is to consult residents on what to put in place of the house once demolition is complete in about two weeks . 
suggestions range from a memorial garden to a car park . 
housewife Rosemary West , 42 , was jailed for life in November for 10 murders , including her daughter heather and step-daughter Charmaine . 
her builder husband Fred , who was charged with 12 murders , killed himself in jail in January 1995 while awaiting trial . 
West maintained her innocence but the prosecution at her trial said the Wests together picked up girls and sexually tormented them before killing them , cutting up their bodies and burying them in their cellar or garden .
