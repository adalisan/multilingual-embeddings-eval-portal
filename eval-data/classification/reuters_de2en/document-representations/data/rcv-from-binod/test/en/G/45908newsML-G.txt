feelings are running high in the Bosnian town of Bihac about Fikret Abdic . 
to many Bihac Moslems , the millionaire businessman turned politician -- himself a Moslem -- is a traitor worse even than the Serbs who besieged their homes for three years . 
&quot; Most of the young guys in the cemetery were put there by him , &quot; said Reihana Masic , a 23-year-old primary school teacher . 
&quot; More died at the hands of Abdic than of the Serbs . 
her brother , helping to load vegetables at their parents &apos; Bihac market stall , muttered that this was an exaggeration . 
an exaggeration perhaps but people in Bihac and the surrounding Moslem enclave suffered near starvation during the siege and Serb artillery killed Masic &apos;s own 28-year-old sister . 
but to many people in the northwest Bosnian town , who vote along with the rest of the country in elections this weekend , Abdic committed the ultimate crime -- he broke Moslem unity . 
Sarajevo is trying him in absentia as a war criminal and police in his former stronghold of Velika Kladusa have banned an election rally he planned for Thursday . 
Abdic says he will seek to have Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic indicted by a United Nations war crimes commission . 
Abdic , who made his fortune before the 1992-1995 Bosnian war in food processing and retailing , controlled the northern part of the Bihac pocket for three years , ignoring orders from the Moslem-led Bosnian government besieged in Sarajevo . 
based in a castle overlooking Velika Kladusa , a small market town , he applied business principles to warfare . 
by striking deals with the Serbs and Croats , his territory became a haven of relative peace . 
while fellow Moslems suffered appalling deprivation in Bihac , food convoys continued rolling into Velika Kladusa just 40 km ( 25 miles ) to the north . 
Abdic , who beat Izetbegovic in elections for the former collegial Bosnian presidency in 1991 but ceded his place to his rival under a political deal , fought only one major battle -- against Bosnian government forces which overran his enclave last year . 
he fled to neighbouring Croatia . 
supporters of Abdic remain devoted to a man who brought prosperity to Velika Kladusa before the war and relative peace during it . 
but most of them also live in Croatian exile . 
in Velika Kladusa it is hard to find anyone with a good word for Abdic , who is running again in Saturday &apos;s election . 
&quot; Nobody accepts him here . 
this is the man who committed a crime , &quot; said a pensioner standing outside a branch of Abdic &apos;s Agrokomerc supermarket chain . 
&quot; Our youth and children perished because of him . 
Moslems should stick together . 
Izetbegovic &apos;s Democratic Action Party ( SDA ) has used Moslem unity to taunt its opponents in the rest of the opposition . 
&quot; Where were you while Bosnian blood was being spilled for freedom ? 
Masic predicted the SDA would win in Bihac , a town impoverished by war although the few who profit from conflict cruise in Mercedes cars past buildings scarred by Serb shells . 
asked how many votes Abdic would get , she said : &quot; Not one . 
several other Moslem parties are contesting the polls . 
one is led by former Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajdzic , who stood by the government in Sarajevo throughout the dark days and went into opposition only after the fighting had ended . 
during the war nobody asked about party membership , &quot; said Mehmet Alija Lilic , a candidate for the opposition SDP party . 
Lilic , a chemistry teacher , accused the SDA of using Islam to win votes . 
&quot; Religion should not be used for political purposes because it &apos;s a personal matter , &quot; he said at a rally held at a patched-up basketball stadium in a Bihac suburb . 
some people said that ultimately Moslems -- and Serbs and Croats -- should think less about nationalism and more about living peacefully together with other Bosnian communities . 
&quot; There can &apos;t be peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina , which is a multi-ethnic state , as long as nationalist parties are in power , &quot; said Muhamed Durakoviuc , a retired factory manager .
