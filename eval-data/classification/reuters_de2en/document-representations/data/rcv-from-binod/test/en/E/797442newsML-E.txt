North Carolina &apos;s Mecklenburg County Commission has given final approval to a $ 500 million general obligation bond referendum . 
the bond package approved Tuesday night is the county &apos;s largest and will go before the voters Nov 4 . 
it includes $ 415 million of GO bonds to finance construction of 20 new public schools and renovations at 40 schools , plus $ 62 million of GO bonds for jail expansion and $ 23 million GOS for community colleges . 
debt service on the bonds would add about $ 80 to the property tax bill for a $ 150,000 home by 2001 .
