Nicaragua &apos;s left-wing Sandinista Front has dropped its controversial anthem and adopted Beethoven &apos;s Ode to Joy as the party song , former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega said on Saturday . 
the old anthem contained the phrase &quot; The Yankee is the enemy of humanity &quot; and was a relic of the Cold War when the Sandinistas and the U.S. government were sworn enemies , Ortega told reporters . 
but now , as Nicaragua &apos;s October 20 presidential elections approach , the Sandinistas are trying present a moderate image and improve relations with the United States . 
&quot; The anthem we use now is the Ode to Joy , that is our anthem , and it is the anthem that reflects the stage in which we are living , &quot; Ortega said . 
Ludwig van Beethoven &apos;s Ode to Joy was popularised in Latin America with lyrics that speak of peace and brotherhood . 
Ortega said the U.S. government &apos;s attitude has changed since the end of the Cold War and the two powers can now work together in a context of mutual respect . 
&quot; The Sandinista anthem with those lyrics reflects another era of our history that we have since overcome , &quot; he said . 
the Sandinistas governed Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990 , maintaining close relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba , and fighting an eight-year war against U.S.-backed guerrillas known as contras . 
Ortega , the Sandinista &apos;s presidential candidate , is surging in the polls . 
a CID-Gallup poll released on Thursday showed Ortega with 30 percent of the votes , behind Arnoldo Aleman of the right-wing Liberal Alliance with 34 percent . 
Ortega &apos;s popularity has risen by nine percent since April , closing the gap between him and Aleman who once seemed a sure bet to be Nicaragua &apos;s next president , CID-Gallup polls showed .
