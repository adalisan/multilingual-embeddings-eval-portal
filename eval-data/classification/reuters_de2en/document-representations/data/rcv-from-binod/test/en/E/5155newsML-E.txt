higher oil prices have helped Kuwait lower its government budget deficit but structural changes to the economy are needed to cut the shortfall further , the country &apos;s largest commercial bank said on Wednesday . 
oil prices for the remainder of 1996 are expected to remain above the $ 13 a barrel projected in the budget and government spending will remain fairly stable , National Bank of Kuwait ( NBK ) added in a quarterly economic review . 
&quot; The windfall gains should help lower the budget deficit below one billion dinars ( $ 3.3 billion ) , &quot; the bank said , referring to the fiscal year 1995 / 96 that ended on June 30 . 
but it added : &quot; Serious measures to tackle the deficit remain a necessity . 
&quot; It would be quite risky if the current fortuitous drop in the deficit were to give the government a false sense of comfort and reduce the sense of urgency for introducing structural changes outlined in the five year plan for eliminating the deficit by the year 2000 . 
planning officials have said Kuwait should consider raising revenue by imposing tax for the first time on Kuwaiti companies , hiking petrol prices , imposing duties on luxuries , cutting subsidies on public utilities and pursuing privatisation . 
some of these measures are mentioned in a five year plant to eliminate the shortfall by the end of the century . 
the government projected a gap for 1995 / 96 of 1.32 billion dinars or 16 percent of national wealth as measured by gross domestic product ( GDP ) , on spending of 4.23 billion dinars . 
but Finance Minister Minister Nasser al-Rodhan said earlier this year he estimated the 1995 / 96 deficit could turn out as low as 500 million dinars due to lower than expected state spending and higher than expected oil prices . 
recent budgets have been based on an oil price of $ 13 a barrel for Kuwait &apos;s kind of crude , but for most of the past 18 months the price has been $ 15 or above . 
the firm prices helped Kuwait , which runs one of the world &apos;s most lavish welfare states , raise GDP by eight percent and gross national product by 13 percent in 1995 . 
Kuwait covers the gap from state investment reserves already heavily depleted by 1991 Gulf War payments .
