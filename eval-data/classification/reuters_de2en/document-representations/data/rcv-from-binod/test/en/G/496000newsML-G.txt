the Philadelphia flyers , who are battling the New Jersey devils for the top spot in the Eastern Conference , will have to do without the services of Eric Lindros for two of the team &apos;s last three games after the All-Star centre was suspended on Wednesday . 
the National Hockey League suspended Lindros for two games and fined him $ 2,000 after a pair of ugly incidents during Saturday &apos;s game against the New York Rangers . 
the physical centre and team leader was suspended for highsticking Rangers forward Shane Churla at 15 : 04 of the second period and for crosschecking New York defenceman Ulf Samuelsson in the face at the end of the third period . 
he was assessed double minor penalties at the time of each of the incidents . 
&quot; Mr Lindros &apos;s highstick against Mr Churla was reckless and dangerous . 
it is clear that his actions against Mr Churla were not defensive in nature , &quot; said NHL Senior Vice President and discipline chief Brian Burke . 
Burke said the crosscheck to Samuelsson was more of a defensive action than offensive . 
&quot; Nonetheless this type of conduct can not be tolerated . 
Lindros will miss flyers games against the Rangers on Thursday and at Montreal on April 12 . 
the flyers , with 100 points , currently trail New Jersey by just two points . 
both teams have 44 wins and three games remaining , including a head-to-head showdown to complete the regular season . 
the team that finishes first secures home ice advantage for the first three rounds of the playoffs .
