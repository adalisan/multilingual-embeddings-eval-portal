European stocks started mixed on Friday with investors anxious over whether U.S. employment figures later in the day would show subdued inflation pressures . 
on currency markets , the dollar began the European session stronger against the mark but slightly down on the yen after remarks by a senior German central banker supporting the Japanese currency . 
most European bourses made a strong start apart from London , which slipped slightly on interest rate jitters as data on Britain &apos;s economic performance in October registered an 18-month high . 
German and Swiss stocks advanced after Wall Street posted solid gains overnight on the strength of Thursday &apos;s U.S. data suggesting a slowing in the economy , good news for interest rates . 
Paris was closed because of the All Saints holiday . 
London investors took fright when Britain &apos;s Purchasing Managers &apos; Index -- a key guide to economic performance -- rose to 54.5 percent in October from 53.5 percent in September . 
as London &apos;s FTSE index dipped on these figures , investors joined the rest of Europe switching attention to the U.S. data due at 1330 GMT for clues on the health of the world &apos;s biggest economy . 
&quot; Most people are betting on a benign number out of the U.S. , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; If we get it , I think we &apos;ll see most markets rally . 
the U.S. employment data is watched closely because of its global influence . 
when June &apos;s healthy U.S. payroll data stoked fears of higher interest rates , Wall Street suffered its seventh biggest drop ever , with consequent chaos on European bourses . 
in Frankfurt , most investors took an optimistic view . 
early floor trading was up nearly one percent , encouraged by Wall Street &apos;s strong perfromance and stronger bonds market . 
but volumes were thin because of a holiday in most areas of Germany and some investors were reluctant to stick their necks out ahead of the U.S. figures . 
the dollar climbed half a pfennig against the mark but was slightly weaker against the yen because of a knock-on effect as the Japanese currency strengthened against the mark . 
the mark fell against the yen after Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke said a strong yen against the mark would help German exporters . 
&quot; The latest pattern is simply to trade off the latest comment you see on the screen -- and the last comment was Welteke &apos;s , &quot; said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy . 
&quot; Basically he was talking the deutschemark down . 
currency traders were also awaiting the non-farm payrolls figures , the final instalment of the week &apos;s heavy schedule of U.S. data . 
although U.S. equity markets have in the past reacted wildly to payrolls data that was out of line with expectations , currency markets have tended to be calmer . 
&quot; I think the dollar will react to any kind of interest rate sentiment , barring some big asset price move , &quot; said David Bloom , U.S. economist at HSBC James Capel in London . 
the dollar was trading around 1.5195 marks and 113.60 yen versus 1.5132 and 113.77 in late European business on Thursday . 
in Paris , markets were closed because of the holiday . 
gold was fixed at $ 377.35 an ounce , compared to Thursday &apos;s close of $ 379.75 . 
silver was weaker at $ 4.80 , down six cents .
