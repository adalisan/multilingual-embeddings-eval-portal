the Thai baht firmed against the dollar in late Wednesday trade in the domestic market on easing demand for the dollar and the baht &apos;s improving sentiment after an IMF multi-billion dollar bailout , dealers said . 
corporate demand for dollars has also slowed as they seem to think the baht might firm a bit more yet , &quot; said one dealer at a local bank . 
the baht strengthened to 31.43 / 31.55 late in the onshore market from 31.60 / 31.70 in early morning trade . 
the IMF and other Asian nations on Monday came to the rescue of Thailand , pledging a total of $ 16 billion in loans . 
the offer is the largest international financial package for a single country since the IMF and donors led by the United States made nearly $ 50 billion available to Mexico in 1995 . 
dealers said the baht &apos;s gains against the dollar was stemmed by the recent turmoil in regional currencies which prompted people to shift to the safer U.S. unit . 
the baht was quoted at 31.40 / 31.50 to the dollar late in offshore against 31.20 / 31.30 . 
the one-month baht / dollar swap premium was at 13 / 17 satangs per dollar late in the domestic market and 22 / 32 satangs in the offshore market . 
the overnight interbank rate was steady at 11.50-12.00 late compared with 12.00 percent in the morning .
