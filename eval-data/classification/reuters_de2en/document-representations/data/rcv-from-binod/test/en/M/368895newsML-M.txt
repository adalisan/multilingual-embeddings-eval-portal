sterling climbed over three pfennigs to new 52-month peaks of 2.7460 marks on Tuesday and analysts say further gains are expected as a strong UK economy highlights German economic weakness . 
the currency is also an EMU ( economic monetary union ) &quot; safe haven &quot; , &quot; said Lee Ferridge , currency strategist at Commerzbank . 
in late Europe , sterling was trading at 2.7456 / 65 marks and just off fresh 52-month peaks of 2.7460 marks , though over three pfennigs up from 2.7130 / 40 in late Europe on Monday . 
against the dollar , sterling was also a touch firmer , trading at $ 1.6409 / 16 against $ 1.6380 / 90 in late Europe on Monday . 
traders said sterling got a fresh shot in the arm on Tuesday from dollar / mark strength , a Times newspaper column - a reminder of German economic weakness - and a BBC report saying rising German unemployment had pushed expectations for a 1997 budget deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP . 
in response to the BBC report , the German Finance Ministry said there was &quot; no reason &quot; to revise its forecast for a budget deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP . 
&quot; The German economy is in very poor shape - that is not news - but we have seen a couple of high profile stories highlighting the problems , &quot; said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy . 
&quot; We could well have a situation were we could end up at the old ERM ( Exchange rate mechanism ) 2.7780-mark level , &quot; he added . 
Coleman said sterling is a good bet because it is likely to remain outside the first stage of European monetary union and the fact that the UK &apos;s economic fundamentals are looking good . 
&quot; The UK economy is growing quite well compared to the rest of Europe and Japan ... And it &apos;s still very much a high-yielder , &quot; he said . 
even Prime Minister John Major had a part to play in sterling &apos;s rally on Tuesday , said analysts . 
Britain &apos;s economy is more competitive than it has been in a long time despite sterling &apos;s recent rise , Major said . 
he described Britain &apos;s economic prospects as &quot; sparklingly positive &quot; . 
inflation was low , growth was rising , unemployment was falling , exports were rising and Britain was enjoying a degree of competitiveness , notwithstanding the recent rise in the exchange value of sterling against the deutschmark . 
&quot; Major &apos;s comments seem to have given the market a green light for further gains on Tuesday , &quot; said Commerzbank &apos;s Ferridge . 
and even with interest rates not expected to rise this side of a general election , analysts said sterling should remain the darling of currency markets . 
&quot; Interest rates , while they have not gone up , are much higher than in Germany . 
gilts are overperforming bunds and there is no stopping sterling , &quot; said Ferridge . 
even , said analysts , if UK unemployment figures due out on Wednesday are poor , the mood would not be spoiled much . 
&quot; Whatever the figures are , sterling will go up . 
strong figures , a drop in unemployment , means rates will go up , &quot; said Coleman . 
Coleman said a weak figure would encourage the gilt market to perform strongly and in turn send sterling higher . 
UK January unemployment is expected to drop by 30,000 against a drop of 45,000 in December , that compares to Germany &apos;s unemployment figure jumping by half a million to a post-war record of 4.66 million . 
&quot; The market is still factoring in Germany &apos;s huge jump in unemployment figures , &quot; said a senior trader at a German bank .
