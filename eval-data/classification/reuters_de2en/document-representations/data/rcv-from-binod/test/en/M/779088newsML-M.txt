the dollar padded early gains to end higher in the U.S. , hitting a new 94-month peak versus the mark as the Bundesbank kept rates steady and German and Japanese officials showed little concern over dollar strength . 
the Bundesbank surprised investors by fixing its repo rate at 3.0 percent for the next two weeks , thwarting predictions of a variable rate , which would likely cause it to rise . 
&quot; The market was anticipating some kind of change in German rates and when it didn &apos;t come , people started buying dollars against the mark , &quot; said Kisoo Park , senior currency dealer at Bank of Boston . 
Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing also boosted the dollar with comments to German weekly magazine &quot; Boerse-Online &quot; indicating German officials were only worried about the speed of the dollar &apos;s ascent , not the dollar &apos;s level . 
the dollar has risen 22 percent against the mark in 1997 and 7.5 percent since June 1 . 
&quot; Most likely the market will want to test the 1.90 level to see if there &apos;s any reaction out of the Bundesbank and some economists are talking about 2.0 , &quot; said one currency trader . 
the dollar rose to 1.8790 / 00 marks from 1.8770 / 80 at the open after trading as high as 1.8832 during the U.S. session . 
the dollar rose to 119.20 / 30 yen from 118.65 / 75 at the open and to 1.5340 / 50 Swiss francs from 1.5305 / 15 . 
the respected German IFO economic institute issued a report that a dollar move above 1.90 marks would &quot; set off alarm bells &quot; at the Bundesbank , which temporarily halted the dollar &apos;s climb . 
but bargain-hunters quickly intervened to push the dollar back up , and traders asserted the Bundesbank has little or no reason to halt the dollar &apos;s rise versus the mark . 
&quot; The world economy is benefiting from a strong dollar , with Germany first and foremost . 
it &apos;s hard to see why they should fight this trend , &quot; said Steen Jakobsen , treasurer at Christiania Bank in New York . 
a stronger dollar makes German exports cheaper and more competitive in global markets . 
dollar / yen rose in Asian trading after Thailand &apos;s central bank suspended operations of 42 finance companies in order to ease a cash crunch stemming from a sharp economic slump . 
investors bought dollars against the Thai baht , causing some spillover buying of dollar / yen , dealers said . 
Japan &apos;s influential Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs , Eisuke Sakakibara also lifted the dollar by denying a rumor that he had warned traders not to buy the dollar above 119 yen . 
Sakakibara added that he would not comment on foreign exchange market movements . 
&quot; Sakakibara doesn &apos;t seem to have a problem with the dollar , which helped push it higher , &quot; Jakobsen said . 
the dollar rose against the French franc as traders said French pharmaceutical giant Rhone-Poulenc SA bought about $ 1.7 billion in conjunction with its previously announced plans to buy the remaining 32.7 percent of American subsidiary Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc that it does not already own . 
the dollar rose to 6.3435 / 65 French francs from 6.3400 / 30 at the open and 6.2935 / 65 at Monday &apos;s close . 
elsewhere , sterling fell to $ 1.6240 / 50 from $ 1.6275 / 85 . 
the Australian dollar fell to $ 0.7382 / 87 from $ 0.7412 / 17 .
