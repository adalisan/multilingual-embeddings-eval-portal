with first quarter earnings season mostly over , Wall Street will immerse itself in a sea of economic data and interest rate worries this week . 
while some companies still have their quarterly reports ahead of them , the Street is likely to start fretting about what the Federal Reserve will do when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets again on May 20 . 
the week ahead will be replete with key economic indicator reports . 
Monday brings a report on March new home sales . 
Tuesday follows with the first quarter Employment Cost Index and April consumer confidence . 
the first look at the real gross domestic product for the first quarter is due Wednesday . 
the April NAPM report comes Thursday , and Friday brings the eagerly awaited , and dreaded , employment report for April . 
&quot; The last big week for earnings is over . 
now we revert to a rate-driven market , &quot; said Thom Brown , managing director at Rutherford Brown and Catherwood . 
on Friday the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 53.38 points to 6738.87 . 
for the week , the Dow gained 35.32 points . 
he said that investors would be keeping an eye out for any glimmer of inflation in data starting on Monday and that perceptions of inflation will dictate the market &apos;s tone . 
&quot; Any suggestion that inflation is surfacing will be a negative . 
anything that suggests it &apos;s not surfacing will be a positive . 
we &apos;re in for a very interest rate sensitive market , &quot; he said . 
the market is seeing a tug-of-war between strong earnings reports and the fear of a long bond yield which is crawling towards the 7.25 percent area at which debt instruments become more attractive than equities . 
&quot; We will continue to see good earnings and still have interest rate risks , &quot; said Peter Canelo , chief investment strategist at Dean Witter . 
&quot; We &apos;re in a trading range environment , with the range between 6300 and 6800 on the Dow , &quot; he said . 
in the short-term , we have to see how aggresively the Fed moves in May . 
Peggy Farley , chief executive officer at Amas Securities , said that concern about rates was pervading the market and had erased it &apos;s recent gains . 
&quot; Whether this fear is predicated on reality or not , I don &apos;t know . 
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a foregone conclusion that the Fed will raise rates again in May . 
there is a lot of ammunition to support the argument that inflation has been contained , wages are not surging higher and that the economy is slowing down . 
Farley said that high techs , which have taken a beating depsite a knockout rally in shares of International Business machines Corp last Thursday on the back of a better than expected first quarter earnings report , were still among the best sectors in the market . 
&quot; I think the high techs are one area that is impervious to the strong dollar in terms of our ability to continue to export , &quot; she said . 
&quot; The techs always fall first because they are vulnerable . 
there is an aura of speculation about them so the money gets pulled out of them first . 
but they will continue to show solid earnings . 
the meeting of G7 ministers and central bank governors starting this Sunday may also have an impact on markets , said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . 
&quot; It &apos;s one of the wild cards , &quot; Metz said of the meeting . 
&quot; No one expects anything . 
but I think they may send a signal that the period of maximum monetary accommodation is behind us . 
this will have an impact on bonds and , therefore , the stock market . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen the big bounce back in stocks , partly due to some positive surprises in the earnings reports .
