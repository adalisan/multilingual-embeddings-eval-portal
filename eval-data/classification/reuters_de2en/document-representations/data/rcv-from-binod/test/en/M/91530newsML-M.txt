the German financial market stands to suffer if the Bundesbank keeps its minimum reserve requirement unchanged because it could force more business to be conducted abroad , analysts said on Wednesday . 
&quot; In light of the obstacle of minimum reserves , I see no chance for the repo market to develop properly in Germany , &quot; said Hermann Remsperger , chief economist at BHF Bank in Frankfurt after a Bundesbank member said earlier on Wednesday he expected no changes would be made to the reserve requirement . 
echoing complaints from the German banking association , Remsperger said Germany needs a properly functioning repo market to keep pace with competitors and warned the Bundesbank reserve requirement prevented the market from developing . 
the Bundesbank currently requires banks to hold minimum reserves on short-term borrowings obtained from foreign banks or domestic non-banks in non-interest bearing accounts at the central bank , generally prompting commercial banks to conduct such operations abroad . 
currently , the reserve level is two percent on sight and term deposits and 1.5 percent on savings deposits , having been pared back several times . 
but Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick , shrugging off banks &apos; criticism , said it would be inappropriate to cut or abolish reserves at a time Germany was insisting that the future European central bank implement a reserve requirement . 
&quot; It would be legitimate to ask whether one would not run the risk of completely sabotaging the concept of minimum reserves if Germany were to cut its own requirement again , &quot; Koebnick told Reuters in an interview . 
Koebnick , also president of the state central bank in the states of Rhineland Palatinate and Saarland , argued another cut in reserve requirements would be fruitless to bring business back to Germany . 
analysts however said a less restrictive environment would greatly improve conditions in Germany . 
&quot; A reduction in the reserve requirement might create the possibility that the business will not be as concentrated , &quot; Remsperger said . 
but other analysts said the lack of a functioning German repo market could not be blamed entirely on the Bundesbank . 
&quot; Business goes where there is the highest amount of liquidity and in some instances , this is in London , &quot; said Thomas Haessler , analyst at Trinkaus Capital Markets in Duesseldorf . 
at the same time , he said there was no fundamental reason why the repo business could not come back to Germany , particularly if the market distinguishes itself through other methods like a strong infrastructure . 
&quot; The trend could be that the repo business could grow a little in the German market , &quot; he added .
