the Czech National Bank ( CNB ) signed a one-year , $ 2.0 billion revolving syndicated credit on Friday , at 10 basis points above Libor , the cheapest credit granted to a post-Communist borrower . 
the credit is priced at 10 basis points above Libor -- a fee of five basis points above Libor plus a margin of five basis points -- as well as an additional 2.5 basis points if more than 50 percent of the facility is drawn . 
&quot; The transaction was put together in a very short period of time , a record period of time , &quot; Jean Facon of J.P. Morgan told a news conference after a signing ceremony . 
&quot; It is important for the banks which have been supporting the Czech Republic ... to demonstrate a commitment of their support and confidence that measures being taken by authorities are in line with expectations in the financial community . 
the credit , arranged by four international banks and syndicated to a total of 24 institutions , was raised to $ 2.0 billion from $ 1.5 billion due to high syndicate demand . 
the credit is to act as a standby to strengthen the CNB &apos;s foreign exchange reserves , CNB bank board member Ludek Niedermeyer said . 
&quot; We have received a strong signal that investors in the Czech Republic are very positive , &quot; he told the news conference . 
the Czech crown came under a heavy downward pressure last month as speculators targeted the currency as overvalued , and the ruling coalition government teetered near a possible collapse . 
the credit is priced below the Czech Export Bank &apos;s recently concluded $ 250 million Eurobond which came in at 12.5 basis points above the London Interbank offered Rate ( Libor ) . 
the CNB was eventually forced on May 27 to float the currency and abandon its 15 percent fluctuation band within which it would fix the currency against a mark / dollar peg . 
CNB reserves were just over $ 11 billion at the end of April , before several CNB interventions in late May -- which analysts estimated totalling between $ 1 billion and $ 3 billion -- to bolster the Czech crown against speculative attacks . 
the Czech Republic carries investment-grade sovereign debt ratings of &quot; A &quot; from Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s and BAA1 from Moody &apos;s . 
the crown had lost more than 15 percent of its value against major currencies since February , but strengthened in recent days as the government launched its austerity programme and narrowly won a parliamentary vote of confidence . 
the Czech Republic paid off its entire $ 471 million in post-Communist transformation credit granted by the IMF ahead of schedule in 1994 , because of strong growth in foreign exchange reserves . 
the debt was scheduled to be paid off between the years 1996 and 1999 . 
foreign reserves grew backed by a fixed exchange rate and strong interest yield differentials against major currencies .
