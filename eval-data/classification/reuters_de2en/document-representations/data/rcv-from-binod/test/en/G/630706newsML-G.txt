the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) on Monday threatened worldwide attacks against Israeli and U.S. targets if the two countries continued to &quot; support Turkish massacres against Kurds &quot; . 
PKK central committee member Halil Atas told reporters in a Beirut suburb -- a bastion of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas -- that the PKK planned attacks against tourist centres in Turkey and warned tourists of the dangers of spending their vacations there . 
&quot; In order to put Turkey in a state of bankruptcy we will hit its economy and we will especially attack touristic centres . 
we have planned specific attacks against such targets , &quot; he said . 
speaking as Turkey &apos;s foray in pursuit of PKK guerrillas in northern Iraq entered its 19th day , Atas urged countries of the region to take a decisive stance in order to bring the Turkish &quot; barbaric attacks &quot; to an end . 
meanwhile , Turkish troops backed by artillery , armour and helicopter gunships continued to consolidate their positions in northern Iraq . 
&quot; We will not be responsible for the safety of tourists . 
we are warning tourists and we are saying that it is dangerous for you to go there ... Turkey is a dangerous country , &quot; Atas said . 
the PKK also planned attacks against U.S. and Israeli &quot; non-civilian &quot; targets , he added . 
&quot; Our plan is to attack Turkish , American and Israeli centres but not civilians and we are warning them not to support the massacres taking place against the Kurdish people . 
the campaign against Kurds was carried out under a strategic deal between the three countries , he said . 
&quot; If these countries continue to carry out massacres against the Kurdish people then these people will make their objective to hit targets of these countries in the world , &quot; he said . 
Atas urged Arab countries to protest against the invasion , saying it left little room for the settlement of regional conflicts . 
&quot; The issues of the people of the region are linked to the Kurdish issue and we see the settlement of Middle Eastern issues as linked to the settlement of the Kurdish question , &quot; he said . 
Atas rejected as &quot; lies &quot; Turkish claims that more than 1,000 PKK fighters had been killed in the latest attack and said the PKK held as prisoners of war the seven-man crew of a Turkish Cobra helicopter brought down on April 18 . 
&quot; After 13 years of fighting against Turkey , we know how to fight this country . 
our ability to hit hard at the enemy in our regions has become stronger , &quot; Atas said . 
&quot; We will make the withdrawal of the Turkish state more difficult than its advance into our areas .
