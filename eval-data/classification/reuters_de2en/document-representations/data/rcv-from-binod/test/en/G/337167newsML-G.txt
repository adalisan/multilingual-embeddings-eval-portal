South African policemen have confessed to killing black activist Steve Biko 20 years ago , unwittingly creating a martyr who helped turn the world against apartheid , officials said on Tuesday . 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said the retired officers , who were named , were seeking amnesty in return for a full confession about one of apartheid &apos;s most notorious crimes . 
&quot; Members of the former security branch acknowledge responsibility for assaults on Stephen Bantu Biko ... in September 1977 ... and the killing of Mr Biko , &quot; deputy commission chairman Alex Boraine told a news conference . 
&quot; The information we have gathered constitutes a major breakthrough . 
Biko led South Africa &apos;s black consciousness movement in the 1970s . 
he died from brain damage in a police cell a month after being arrested in the Eastern Cape city of Port Elizabeth , where Tuesday &apos;s announcement was made . 
dead at the age of 30 , Biko became a martyr for black South Africans and an icon for anti-apartheid activists worldwide . 
disgust at the brutality of his death hastened white-ruled South Africa &apos;s transformation into a pariah state , and a film about Biko , &quot; cry Freedom &quot; , became an international success . 
he was the most prominent black activist to die while detained without trial under draconian security laws used to suppress opposition to the policy of racial separation . 
people who knew Biko as the charismatic leader of the Black consciousness Movement say only he could have challenged Nelson Mandela for election as South Africa &apos;s first black president . 
Donald Woods , a white newspaper editor who befriended Biko and wrote his biography , applauded the news on Tuesday . 
&quot; It feels good , &quot; Woods , a central character in cry Freedom , told Reuters at an interview in his Johannesburg home . 
&quot; I &apos;ve been wondering for years when they would come out of the woodwork , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Too much has been hidden for too long . 
the truth commission pointed out that the shrouded circumstances of Biko &apos;s death were only coming to light , 20 years later , because of the lure of its much-criticised amnesty . 
&quot; Our investigative work , with the prospect of amnesty , has persuaded those who say they were involved in perpetrating the acts to come forward for the first time , &quot; Boraine said . 
the commission can grant a pardon for full confessions about politically motivated crimes , in the hope of healing the past . 
the Biko family , however , say they do not want amnesty for his killers , but prosecution and justice . 
&quot; If you have evidence , the way to go about it is to go to court , &quot; his son Nkosinathi Biko said recently . 
Biko &apos;s widow took the state to court last year to oppose the amnesty provision , but failed . 
Boraine said a number of ex-policemen were seeking amnesty for at least 10 killings of anti-apartheid figures in the Eastern Cape in the 1970s and 80s . 
four officers have applied in the Biko case , the oldest now 75 , and a fifth has made contact , their lawyer Francois van der Merwe told a news conference . 
he would not say if they admitted intent to kill Biko , or if it was a beating gone too far . 
he appealed for understanding for the men who he said had been spurned by the apartheid masters they served . 
&quot; They could do with more support ... they are virtual outcasts at this stage , &quot; Van der Merwe said . 
&quot; My clients came forward with a concern to try to make a contribution to the work of the Truth Commission and to contribute to the process of reconciliation , &quot; he said . 
Biko was severely beaten during interrogation in Port Elizabeth in September 1977 . 
he was then driven 1,200 km ( 700 miles ) in the back of a police vehicle , naked , in chains and with his wounds untreated , to Pretoria where he later died in a prison cell . 
though his body showed evidence of sustained torture , an inquest failed to identify anyone responsible . 
the official version was first that Biko died on hunger strike , then that he went wild and bumped his head during questioning . 
apartheid police minister Jimmy Kruger caused outrage at the time when he said of Biko &apos;s death : &quot; It leaves me cold . 
Commission officials say they do not know if others were involved in the killing , or how high any chain of command might have reached . 
but Boraine said he hoped bosses too would own up . 
&quot; This example I hope will encourage many more from the highest levels and the command structures to come forward so that this reconciliation process can be concluded , &quot; he said .
