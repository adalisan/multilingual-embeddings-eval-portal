fast Bowler Waqar Younis and leg-spinner Shahid Afridi shared seven West Indies wickets as Pakistan coasted to victory in the first match of the World Series Cup best-of-three finals on Saturday . 
West Indies slumped from 99 without loss to 179 for nine in their 50 overs and Pakistan won the day-night clash by four wickets . 
Wicketkeeper Moin Khan , who hit an unbeaten 38 , hoisted a six over long-off from the gentle leg-spin of Shivnerine Chanderpaul to complete Pakistan &apos;s win at 185 for six with 70 balls to spare . 
the young Pakistani team were always likely to take the opening game of the finals after West Indies collapsed in dramatic fashion , losing seven wickets for 24 in 10 overs . 
Waqar , back to his bristling best this week after a month off with a shoulder injury , took three wickets for one run in one devastating nine-ball spell . 
he finished with four for 43 . 
but it was Afridi who did most to ensure the victory , starting with his dismissal of Brian Lara caught and bowled for nought . 
Lara had almost single-handedly dragged West Indies into the final , scoring 295 in his previous three Cup innings , including 103 not out in his last game against Pakistan . 
Afridi was mobbed by his ecstatic team mates after plucking the return catch from Lara off his shoelaces and hurling the ball into the air in celebration . 
Pakistan captain Wasim Akram later said he had urged Afridi to improve his game after some poor recent form and the &quot; talking to &quot; appeared to have worked . 
&quot; He got a couple of crucial wickets , fielded well and he batted well , he batted a little better with a little more sense than before , &quot; Akram told a news conference . 
Afridi &apos;s dismissal of Lara appeared to shock his fellow batsmen , who fell in quick succession afterwards with a series of tentative shots . 
the leg spinner finished with three for 33 , his best ever figures in a one-day match . 
the procession of batsmen to and from the dressing room was an uncanny replay of West Indies &apos; display against Pakistan on the same ground on Tuesday , when they lost eight wickets for 25 in 11 overs in the league phase of the triangular competition . 
Afridi , who burst onto the world cricketing stage last year with the fastest ever one-day century , then opened the Pakistani innings by blasting eight fours on his way to 53 from 54 balls . 
veteran right-hander Ijaz Ahmed ( 60 ) took up where Afridi left off , bringing up his 50 with a classic cover drive for four off the medium pace of Phil Simmons . 
Pakistan &apos;s victory was all the more noteworthy given they went into the match without usual opener Aamir Sohail , who was suspended for one match after arguing with an umpire in Pakistan &apos;s loss to Australia on Thursday . 
Pakistan and West Indies made the best-of-three finals series when hosts Australia were last week eliminated from the annual competition for the first time since 1979-80 . 
the two teams now travel to Melbourne where they play the key second final on Monday . 
if West Indies square the series on Monday , they will play a decider in Melbourne on Wednesday . 
an already injury-plagued West Indies will travel to Melbourne further depleted by injury . 
strike Bowler Curtly Ambrose strained a groin in the match and all-rounder Carl Hooper remains in doubt with a Shin injury that kept him out of the loss to Pakistan , West Indies captain Courtney Walsh said . 
All-rounder Simmons was drafted into the team for this match just a day after flying in to Australia to replace pace Bowler Nixon Mclean . 
Walsh acknowledged the side &apos;s poor batting peformance . 
&quot; We didn &apos;t bat as well as we should have batted , &quot; he said . 
&quot; With eight batters you &apos;ve got to keep it ticking and on that wicket about 220-230 would have been a more realistic total . 
Pakistan have never won the competition in five previous attempts , while West Indies have won it six times in nine challenges .
