an estimated 115,000 Rwandan refugees abandoned Kahindo camp in eastern Zaire because of security problems on Wednesday and started moving to a camp already crammed with 400,000 people , aid workers said . 
&quot; The whole population of Kahindo camp , 115,000 people , is on the move . 
it appears they packed up in the past few hours and started moving towards Mugunga camp , &quot; said Michelle Quintaglie , a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Programme in Goma city . 
&quot; We hear reports there were security problems in the area over the past few hours , &quot; said Quintaglie , adding that they would have to move through Virunga National Park on the way to Mugunga camp , about 50 km ( 30 miles ) southwest of Kahindo . 
&quot; If these people arrive in Mugunga we will have a major , major problem on our hands . 
we already have 400,000 in Mugunga and the arrival of such a large number could be chaotic , &quot; she told Reuters . 
shelling and shooting in Kibumba camp on Friday night and Saturday prompted the 200,000 refugees there to flee to Mugunga , west of Goma city , on Saturday , swelling its population to some 400,000 and making it the largest refugee camp in the world . 
Quintaglie noted Kahindo was very close to Katale camp , with an estimated 200,000 refugees , and said aid workers feared the exodus from Kahdino would soon prompt Katale residents to flee . 
the departure of the population of Kahindo brought the total number of refugees uprooted by nearly two weeks of fighting in eastern Zaire between ethnic Tutsi rebels and Zairean troops to more than 600,000 . 
aid agencies are scrambling to prevent a large loss of life from disease and hunger in Mugunga . 
the U.N. refugee agency says it has no access to up to 400,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees around Goma and another 300,000 around the towns of Goma and Butare .
