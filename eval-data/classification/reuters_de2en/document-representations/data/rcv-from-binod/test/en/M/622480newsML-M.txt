foreign exchange trading is likely to gravitate increasingly towards the large financial centers in Europe and Asia at the expense of New York as dealings in emerging market currencies grow , said Eugene Prim , President of ACI The Financial Markets Association . 
&quot; In the future I think you will have two big worldwide foreign exchange centers in London and Tokyo / Singapore , &quot; said Prim in an interview with Reuters Financial Television . 
Prim said he expects trading volumes in Eastern European , African and Asian currencies to increase , with London and Tokyo absorbing the lion &apos;s share of these trades because of time zone considerations . 
shifting of time zones -- along with bank mergers and the introduction of a single European currency -- are the biggest challenges facing the foreign exchange industry , Prim said . 
he noted that U.S. membership in the ACI , a foreign exchange trade organization , was declining even as membership in other parts of the world was stable or increasing . 
&quot; It is not a question of profitability but a quest for having less dealing rooms around the world , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In New York , for certain banks , it is no longer attractive to have dealing rooms . 
Prim spoke to Reuters during the ACI &apos;s 39th annual World Forex congress , taking place in Toronto this week .
