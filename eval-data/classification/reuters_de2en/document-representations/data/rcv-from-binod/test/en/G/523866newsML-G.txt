Juventus , Internazionale and fiorentina could complete an Italian treble this week by securing places in the finals of the three European club competitions . 
Italy are the only country whose clubs have completed a clean sweep of the Champions &apos; Cup , Cup Winners &apos; Cup and UEFA Cup in the same season throughout the 42-year history of UEFA club soccer . 
and all three Italian clubs are handily placed to at least get to the finals this time . 
reigning European champions Juventus face Ajax at home in the second leg of their European Cup semifinal 2-1 up from the first leg ; fiorentina start their Cup Winners &apos; Cup second leg level at 1-1 at home against Barcelona , while Inter take a 3-1 lead to Monaco in the UEFA Cup . 
none of them however , will have things entirely their own way . 
Ajax , who were beaten on penalties by Juventus in last season &apos;s European Cup final in Rome , have not lost away in the Champions &apos; League or European Cup since its inception in 1992 and will be keen to maintain that record at least in Turin . 
the winners of that tie will face either Manchester United or Borussia Dortmund in the final in Munich on May 28 -- and both United and Dortmund have strong emotional incentives to reach that final . 
the names of Manchester United and Munich are forever linked because of the 1958 air disaster when United &apos;s plane crashed on take-off after a refuelling stop in Munich , killing 23 people including eight United players and three club officials . 
United , oddly , have played 122 matches in Europe since 1956 -- but never one in the city where the &quot; Busby babes &quot; died almost 40 years ago . 
Dortmund are just as keen to reach the final as they could arguably become European champions in the home stadium of one of their main rivals , Bayern Munich . 
if fiorentina do get past Barcelona in the Cup Winners &apos; Cup they will meet probably meet holders Paris St Germain in the final in Rotterdam on May 14 . 
PSG take a 3-0 first-leg lead to Liverpool on Thursday and could break a 36-year-old jinx that has had a hold on the competition ever since fiorentina lost the final in 1962 . 
fiorentina had been the competition &apos;s first winners in 1961 but their defeat in the following year &apos;s final set a pattern for the competition which has meant that no team has ever won the cup in successive seasons . 
Atletico Madrid , AC Milan , Anderlecht , Ajax , Parma and Arsenal have all come close and failed . 
in the UEFA Cup , Inter look a fair bet to reach the final for the third time in seven seasons following victories in 1991 and 1994 . 
they travel to Monaco who will have to put behind them some recent poor form in the league . 
however , Monaco have scored three times at home this season against Hamburg and Newcastle in Europe and the outcome is no foregone conclusion . 
no French team has ever won the UEFA Cup but whoever wins this tie would fancy their chances in the final against Schalke or Tenerife , both bidding to reach a European final for the first time in their respective histories .
