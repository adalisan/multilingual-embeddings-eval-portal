the Brussels bourse &apos; Bel-20 index ended below 2,500 points on Tuesday after breaking above it for the first time on Monday as French , Dutch and UK markets also took a breather from recent rises . 
dealers said the Bel-20 , which ended 11.26 points or 0.45 percent easier at 2,493.21 , could bounce to above 2,500 again on Wednesday if the Dow Jones .DJI held on to the nearly 50-point gain it had notched up by 1530 GMT . 
if the Dow fell back , the Bel-20 would too , they said , with a first obvious support at the 2,458-2,444 gap opened on July 3 . 
&quot; The market needed some consolidation and may need some more , &quot; one dealer said . 
virtually all blue chips ended lower , especially those who had shown strong gains recently , such as cement maker CBR and bank holding group Almanij . 
retailer GIB , which has been cited as a turnaround and takeover candidate , bucked the trend , ending 35 francs higher at 1,815 in busy trade .
