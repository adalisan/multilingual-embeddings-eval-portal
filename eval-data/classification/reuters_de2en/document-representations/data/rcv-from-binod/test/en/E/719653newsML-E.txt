California Gov. 
Pete Wilson has signalled he may seek a cut in personal income taxes as part of state budget talks , according to a published report on Thursday . 
the reduction in revenues could cost the state treasury hundreds of millions of dollars , Capitol sources told the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper . 
the Republican governor &apos;s Department of Finance has prepared several options , one of which includes widening tax brackets so taxpayers are not pushed to higher rates as quickly , the Chronicle reported . 
Wilson in January proposed a 10 percent cut in business taxes . 
the plan , however , failed to advance in the state legislature .
