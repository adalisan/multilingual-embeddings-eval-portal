coffee and cocoa prices soared Tuesday as fresh concern about short supplies sparked buying by speculators . 
soybeans , corn and oil prices fell while gold rose . 
the Knight Ridder commodity Research Bureau index of 17 futures prices ended at 247.19 , up 0.05 point . 
at New York &apos;s Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange , cocoa prices jumped for the second day in a row and rose to the highest level in nearly seven months . 
may cocoa closed up $ 59 per metric ton at $ 1,451 , up more than 4 percent on the day . 
the day &apos;s high at $ 1,451 was the highest price for the May contract since August 22 , 1996 . 
&quot; Everyone is used to a bear market in cocoa and every time it rallied everyone sold , &quot; said Allendale commodities analyst Jim Cordier . 
&quot; But I think this market has turned a corner because the fundamentals have changed . 
at a cocoa industry meeting in London Monday , Ivory Coast commodities Minister Alain Gauze said the country &apos;s current crop would fall below 1 million metric tons . 
ivory Coast is the world &apos;s top cocoa producer and exporter , and industry estimates had privately expected the Ivorian crop to be above 1.1 million tons . 
coffee prices also ended broadly higher on supply concerns with May coffee up 3.85 cents a pound at 203.15 cents . 
coffee prices have doubled since November on worries about short supplies from Central America and Brazil this year , along with transport and grower strikes in Colombia . 
the supply tightness , and steady demand from roasters , was expected to keep coffee prices underpinned . 
&quot; It is reasonable to expect that Americans who love coffee are going to be drinking less coffee in 1998 than 1996 because it is not going to be economical , &quot; said Donald Schoenholt of Gillies Coffee , a Brooklyn-based coffee importer and roaster . 
at the Chicago Board of Trade , late buying by speculators and commercial grain firms boosted wheat but soybean and corn prices fell after a government report on supplies . 
may wheat closed 2-3 / 4 cents a bushel higher at $ 3.82 , May soybeans closed down 4-1 / 2 cents a bushel at $ 8.55-1 / 2 and May corn closed down 4 cents a bushel at $ 3.05-3 / 4 . 
soybeans had soared the 30-cent limit Monday ahead of the monthly Agriculture Department estimates on world supply and demand for grains . 
but the department surprised the market by keeping its U.S. end-season soybean stocks estimate unchanged . 
the Agriculture Department left its projected stocks on Sept . 1 at 140 million bushels , above expectations for 125 million to 130 million bushels . 
it left projected corn stockpiles at 950 million bushels . 
corn also was pressured by news that China , usually a grain importer , had sold 126,500 tons of corn to South Korea , a major customer of the United States . 
precious metals ended higher but traders were unsure whether the month-long recovery in prices was resuming after last week &apos;s downward correction . 
April gold at New York &apos;s commodity Exchange closed up $ 2 at $ 355.10 an ounce , and May silver closed up 1.0 cent at $ 5.285 . 
the Dutch central bank &apos;s official gold reserves fell in the week ended March 10 , confirming a sale of 300 metric tons of gold in January . 
but Monday the president of Germany &apos;s central bank , Hans Tietmeyer , said he believed there would be no more European central bank gold sales for now . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange , oil prices fell as mild weather and plentiful supplies pressured the market . 
April crude oil closed 38 cents a barrel lower at $ 20.11 , April heating oil 0.25 cent a gallon lower at 52.83 cents , and April gasoline 0.50 cent a gallon lower at 63.86 cents . 
&quot; There are so many imports being unloaded , &quot; said Michael Busby , trader with Northville Industries . 
&quot; crude didn &apos;t fall any more than it did only because losses in London weren &apos;t so bad , &quot; referring to energy prices at London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange .
