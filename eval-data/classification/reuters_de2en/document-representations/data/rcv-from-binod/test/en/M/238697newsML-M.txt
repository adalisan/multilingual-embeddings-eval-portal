gold was dumped in Hong Kong on Thursday as dealers in the colony were lost for inspiration and found themselves chasing the market down . 
Hong Kong gold extended early losses to close at the day &apos;s low despite a rebound in New York overnight , dealers said . 
&quot; Morning trade kicked off with sales from Japanese traders due to the U.S. dollar &apos;s depreciation , &quot; a senior gold dealer said . 
rumours of central bank selling during the Asian day came in at around $ 370 , a European bank dealer said . 
&quot; At that moment , the market still believed gold could hold over $ 370 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But as the market waited , no buying emerged -- that &apos;s why people started long liquidation . 
professionals who looked to New York levels as a buying opportunity were disappointed , dealing sources said . 
but , one added , &quot; we &apos;re not going below $ 366 yet &quot; . 
trading was expected to be choppy on Friday , in a range of $ 366 to $ 369 an ounce , dealers said . 
&quot; The market is still weak , &quot; said a dealer at a local securities house . 
support was generally seen at around $ 367 to $ 368 , but some dealing sources felt gold could test $ 362 . 
the carryover charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society dropped from + 5 to -5 .
