with his blunt northern accent and trade union background , British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appears an incongruous player on the slick New Labour stage . 
Prescott was Tony Blair &apos;s first appointment after Thursday &apos;s landslide general election victory , a fitting reward for the party deputy leader &apos;s fierce loyalty and his 10,000-mile bus marathon to mobilise the vote in 100 key parliamentary seats . 
it was a stunning achievement for the 58-year-old former cruise-line waiter who left school at 15 and whose uneasy relationship with English grammar made him stand out in the slick soundbite culture of the revitalised new Labour Party . 
Prescott , with a background in the National Union of seamen , appears a throwback to the days when union activists dominated a party of the workers . 
he fought Blair for the party leadership in 1994 after John Smith died suddenly but knew he had little chance and , as an insurance policy , ran for deputy leader too . 
it was immediately seen as a dream ticket -- Blair to woo the middle class and Prescott to act as the guarantor for traditional party members that , whatever reforms Blair pushed through , the heart of the party would remain true to its roots . 
the Conservatives seized on this , pointing at Prescott to hammer home their message that &quot; New Labour &quot; was still socialist in &quot; tooth and claw &quot; and only hiding behind a fake image . 
but the Conservative attack foundered as the partnership of the former ship steward and Blair , the privately educated lawyer , proved stunningly effective . 
many people still dismissed Prescott as a mere fixer , carrying out the reforms dreamed up by Blair . 
cartoonists , caricaturing the trademark Prescott scowl , drew him as the bulldog used by Labour in a now-famous campaign broadcast , firmly under Blair &apos;s control . 
they also zeroed in on his tortured use of English -- bitingly satirised by columnists but blamed by some on a form of dyslexia which may lie behind his early school failure . 
but this is to underestimate Prescott -- an easy but , as the Conservatives discovered , fatal mistake . 
Prescott may have left school at 15 . 
but he completed his education as a trade-union sponsored adult student , taking a degree in economics and going on to produce a stream of policy papers on regional development and employment . 
dismissed as an anachronism , Prescott sees himself as an early moderniser long before Blair came on the scheme . 
Prescott underlined his claims in a recent interview with Reuters on his campaign bus . 
&quot; I coined the phrase &quot; traditional values in a modern setting &apos; , &quot; he said . 
it was Prescott , in a memorable party conference speech in 1993 , who swung the unions behind a key reform of party democracy which laid the foundations for Blair . 
and Prescott hurled himself into Blair &apos;s campaign to ditch the traditional Labour Party commitment to mass industrial ownership -- seen as one of the defining moments on the path to power . 
such loyalty is recognised by Blair , who said in one conference speech : &quot; If I &apos;m fighting in the jungle there &apos;s nobody I &apos;d rather have with me than John Prescott . 
but the relationship between the deeply religious lawyer and the bluff former steward who can alternate between truculence and infectious laughter is still an enigma to most . 
&quot; It &apos;s the closeness of the working operation between us ... that encourages people to say this is what some people might have called The odd couple . 
but it seems to work very well . 
we have respect and confidence in each other , &quot; Prescott said .
