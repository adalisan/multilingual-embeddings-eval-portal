U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday will begin seeking technology-based solutions to shield children from the seamier side of cyberspace . 
Clinton will huddle with lawmakers , software manufacturers , parents and other groups to discuss new approaches , following last month &apos;s Supreme Court decision striking down a law banning indecent material on the Internet . 
the ban , contained in the 1996 Communications Decency Act , had placed the onus of keeping children away from indecent material on the millions of people who post information on the Internet . 
the court rejected the broad ban as violating the First Amendment rights of adults . 
after the law was struck down , Clinton said he saw promise in &quot; filtering &quot; software that parents could use to prevent their children from seeing pornographic material . 
and although Clinton on July 1 issued a policy paper calling for minimal government regulation of the Internet , the president said new laws might be justified to protect children . 
the president &apos;s challenge , Internet specialists said , is to allow children access to interesting and educational sites while blocking inappropriate sites -- all without violating the free speech rights of adults . 
Congress is already considering several proposals . 
Sen. Patty Murray , a Democrat of Washington state who will attend Wednesday &apos;s meeting , said last month she will introduce legislation to create incentives for Internet sites to carry ratings . 
filtering software relies on ratings , similiar to those used for movies and , more recently , television , to determine which sites to block out . 
Murray said the Supreme Court ruling left &quot; a large vacuum &quot; that allowed children to access inappropriate material . 
&quot; We face an unprecedented opportunity to provide parents the necessary tools to protect our children , &quot; Murray said . 
other lawmakers might go further than Murray &apos;s incentive-based approach . 
Sen. Dan coats , a Republican of Indiana , is considering writing legislation but is skeptical that filtering and ratings will be sufficient . 
asked if something like the ratings scheme for television could be applied to the Internet , one coats staff person said &quot; the answer initially seems to be no , &quot; although adding &quot; ratings are still a possibility . 
industry officials will also attend the meeting . 
Microsoft Corp plans to tout its preferred technology for rating sites on the World Wide Web . 
called &quot; Platform for Internet Content Selection , &quot; or PICs , the system adds to Web sites a tag containing ratings that can be read by Web browsing software . 
ratings could be provided by numerous groups and parents could set their children &apos;s software to read or ignore any group &apos;s ratings . 
&quot; It &apos;s important that families are empowered to make decisions that are right for them , &quot; said Laura Jennings , vice president at Microsoft who runs the company &apos;s 2.3 million member online service . 
the American Library Association passed a resolution earlier this month opposing use of filtering software by libraries . 
&quot; The use in libraries of software filters which block constitutionally protected speech is inconsistent with the United States Constitution and federal law , &quot; the group said . 
and civil libertarians said a tagging system could be used by foreign governments to censor anything on the Internet . 
&quot; It creates an immense infrastructure for censorship , &quot; said David Banisar , staff counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center . 
although filtering is generally done by an individual &apos;s Web browser software , filtering could also be done at higher levels that prevent huge numbers of Internet users from accessing some sites , Banisar said .
