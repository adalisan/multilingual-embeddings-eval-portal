it has been almost 30 years since the band helped define American rock music , but singer and bassist Rick Danko feels he is just getting warmed up . 
after a long layoff from making records in the 1980s and early &apos; 90s , Canadian Danko is brimming over with recording and concert projects . 
&quot; I love to play ; a stage is a safe place for me to be , &quot; Danko told Reuters in an interview . 
&quot; It &apos;s not that way for most folks , but I &apos;d be lost without it . 
still one of rock &apos;s great voices at age 53 , Danko is more visible these days than at any time since &quot; The Last waltz , &quot; director Martin Scorsese &apos;s celebrated documentary of the band &apos;s star-studded 1976 &quot; farewell &quot; concert . 
one of Danko &apos;s side projects , the critically acclaimed trio Danko / Fjeld / Andersen , released its second album , &quot; Ridin &apos; on the blinds , &quot; on the Rykodisc label in February . 
the project reunited Danko with his friends Jonas Fjeld , one of Norway &apos;s biggest stars , and Eric Andersen , the respected songwriter who sprang from the 1960s New York folk scene . 
the new album is an intoxicating blend of American roots music seasoned with exotic , centuries-old Norwegian folk instruments . 
one highlight is Danko &apos;s poignant , acoustic rendition of &quot; twilight , &quot; an obscure 1975 band song . 
in addition , the band will soon start work on their next album , targeted for release in early 1998 . 
the legendary group , missing Richard Manuel , who committed suicide in 1986 , and key songwriter Robbie Robertson , has released two albums in the last three years . 
the group plans a 35-concert U.S. tour this summer . 
then there is Danko &apos;s revved-up solo career . 
he will tour Japan in April and May and is planning a live album that would serve as the long-awaited followup to his 1978 solo album that featured Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones &apos; Ron Wood . 
Danko , who lives in Woodstock , New York , also says he would like to make a rock &apos; n &apos; roll duo album with Rolling Stones great Keith Richards , but no plans have been set yet . 
asked about the flurry of activity , Danko said , &quot; I get bored pretty easy , but I &apos;m lucky to have a lot of musical friends that help me take care of those moments . 
a recent solo concert in tiny Foxboro , Massachusetts , found Danko in fine voice . 
expertly backed by drummer Randy Ciarlante and pianist / accordionist Aaron Hurwitz , he romped through old classics like &quot; Stage fright &quot; and &quot; Mystery Train &quot; and a funked-up &quot; chest Fever &quot; from the band &apos;s famous debut album . 
formed in 1960 as backing group for Arkansas rockabilly wild man Ronnie Hawkins , the band combined good-time rock &apos; n &apos; roll with American folk tradition like no group before or since . 
its first two albums , &quot; Music From Big pink &quot; ( 1968 ) and &quot; The band &quot; ( 1969 ) , still rate high on many critics &apos; all-time &quot; best &quot; lists . 
at the heart of the band &apos;s distinctive sound was the deeply soulful singing of Danko , drummer Levon helm and Manuel . 
&quot; Rick &apos;s voice is incredibly unique , &quot; said Hurwitz , who is also the band &apos;s co-producer . 
&quot; It &apos;s a gutsy sound , it &apos;s haunting , and it really appeals to people . 
Danko lists his vocal influences as Hank Williams , Otis Redding , Sam Cooke , kitty Wells , Patsy Cline , and muddy Waters , among others . 
but his heartfelt style was developed the hard way . 
he quit school in Simcoe , Ontario , at age 14 and went to work as an apprentice meatcutter , and he was still a teenager when he ran away to join Hawkins &apos; rockabilly roustabouts . 
never a prolific songwriter , he has co-written some gems over the years . 
&quot; This wheel &apos;s on Fire , &quot; written with Bob Dylan in 1967 , has rolled in its share of royalties -- most recently as the theme music on the British TV series &quot; Absolutely fabulous . 
Danko said there are many old band songs on which he and the others should have been credited as co-writers that were instead credited solely to Robbie Robertson . 
Robertson wrote the group &apos;s best-known songs including &quot; The weight , &quot; &quot; The Night They drove Old Dixie Down &quot; and &quot; Up on cripple creek . 
&quot; He &apos;ll say he did it all if you give him the opportunity , &quot; Danko said of Robertson . 
he said he felt like Mike Love , the Beach Boy who sued bandmate Brian Wilson for withholding songwriting credits on many well-known songs . 
&quot; Maybe I &apos;ll have to end up hiring his lawyer , &quot; he laughed . 
the surviving original band members have turned down offers in the millions of dollars to reunite , Danko said . 
&quot; Money isn &apos;t the object anymore . 
we &apos;re not looking for a job . 
he strongly disagrees with some critics who have carped that the band without Robertson is like &quot; Hamlet &quot; without the prince . 
&quot; Robbie chose to do what he chose to do , and more power to him . 
I think he &apos;s regretted some of those movements , but that &apos;s not my problem . 
Robertson has released three solo albums as well as some movie soundtracks for Scorsese since leaving the band . 
Danko feels that the &quot; new &quot; band -- with original members Danko , helm and Garth Hudson augmented by Ciarlante , Jim Weider and Richard Bell -- is every bit as valid as the &quot; old &quot; band . 
&quot; I appreciate the chemistry of the band over the years and everybody &apos;s contribution , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I would like to see that continue for just as long as we can breathe good air .
