NYMEX heating oil prices ended sharply higher Thursday as unseasonably cold weather descended upon the northeastern United States and sparked a heavy bout of short covering . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty chilly here for this time of year , and it is supposed to continue in the 40s ( degree Fahrenheit ) . 
this caught people by suprise , so there was a lot of short covering , &quot; said Ed Kevelson , director of refined products with Paribas futures in New York . 
may heating oil ended up 1.75 cents a gallon at 54.86 cents . 
may crude settled up 30 cents at $ 19.57 a barrel while May gasoline settled up 0.37 cent a gallon at 61.07 cents . 
the National weather Service said it expects temperatures to remain below normal in the U.S. Northeast for the next six to 10 days starting April 13 , the beginning of spring . 
the region is the largest heating oil market in the world . 
&quot; The cold weather comes at a time when refiners are more into making gasoline and not heating oil , so that may be part of it too , &quot; said a New York heating oil dealer , explaining the market also may be concerned that increased demand may result in tighter heating oil supplies . 
refiners shift to gasoline production at the expense of heating oil output in the spring to line up gasoline supply for the summer driving season . 
oil inventory data released by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) Tuesday showed that as of April 4 , heating oil supplies in the Northeast were sufficient , standing 1.2 million barrels above a year ago . 
much of the short covering in heat was technically driven , with buys stops triggered after spot heat broke 53.75 and 54.50 , session highs for spot heat this past week , dealers said . 
like heating oil , much of May crude &apos;s gains were driven by technical strength . 
may crude bounced off its session low of $ 18.96 , a critical technical support level , dealers said , that was created by May crude &apos;s session low April 4 and which is the lowest point for prompt crude since March 4 , 1996 .
