Argentina &apos;s two main opposition forces , centrist Radical Party and center-left FREPASO , forged Sunday an alliance to face Peronist Party in power in congressional polls in October and presidential polls in 1999 . 
under the pact announced in the morning by both parties , FREPASO &apos;s senator Graciela Fernandez Meijide will head the list of candidates to the mational lower chamber for the key Buenos Airesa province followed by radical Federico Storani . 
in the capital , the list for national deputies candidates will be headed by FREPASO &apos;s Carlos Alvarez followed by the President of Radical Party Rodolfo terragno . 
the agreement was announced hours after former Argentine President Raul Alfonsin , a Radical , said he agreed to decline his candidacy to national deputy for Buenos Aires province . 
his decission was considered a crucial factor for the alliance to be formed . 
leaders from both parties said there could be still some changes in the lists for October 26 congressional polls . 
the new partners committed themselves to face President Carlos Menem &apos;s Peronist Party in 1999 presidential polls , with a formula chosen in internal joint polls . 
Menem ends in 1999 two succesive terms in power and under the Constitution he can not be re-elected for a third straight period . 
the Radical Party and FREPASO have strongly chided his liberal economic program . 
Menem stabilized the currency and erradicated inflation but unemployment grew to 16.1 percent after skyrocketing to 17.3 percent in October 1996 . 
they also criticize corrupction cases involving government officials . 
hours before the alliance was announced Menem said it reminded him of the &quot; sinister &quot; Democratic Union , a coalition of radical , conservatives and socialists defeated in 1946 polls by the founder of Peronism , the late Juan Peron . 
Menem nevertheless clarified he did not mean the new coalition was also sinister . 
Buenos Aires Peronist Governor Eduardo Duhalde was forced to launch in May the candidacy of his wife Hilda to the lower chamber for the province when FREPASO &apos;s Fernandez Meijide --a senator for the capital-- said she would run for deputy for the Buenos Aires province , Duhalde &apos;s stronghold . 
according to private surveys , in Buenos Aires province Hilda Duhalde heads voting intentions with 30 percent against about 30 percent of Fernandez Meijide . 
Alfonsin was running third with less than 20 percent . 
those who head the lists are guarnteed to be elected for the lower chamber but what is really at stake is how many colleagues they can pull along to a congressional seat .
