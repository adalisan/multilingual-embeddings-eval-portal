Asian nations on Sunday were closely monitoring intensified fighting rocking the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh , urging an end to the clashes between rival government forces as embassies tried to contact their nationals . 
thousands of people fled the western part of the city where the fighting had resumed at dawn after erupting on Saturday between troops loyal to First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his former battlefield enemy , Second Prime Minister Hun Sen. 
by mid-afternoon there were conflicting reports of hopes for a peaceful solution to the conflict . 
in Tokyo , Japan &apos;s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Hun Sen had agreed to open talks with Ranariddh forces to end the fighting . 
Japan , Cambodia &apos;s biggest aid donor , had earlier urged Hun Sen to take the initiative to stop the fighting . 
&quot; Our nation is deeply concerned that the Cambodian situation had worsened . 
we strongly urge Second Prime Minister Hun Sen to take the initiative towards a peaceful resolution , &quot; Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said . 
but a Thai army general said he believed Hun Sen had effectively overthrown Ranariddh . 
the general , who declined to be identified , said Hun Sen , with his Cambodian People &apos;s Party ( CPP ) , the former communist rulers of the country , would slowly take full control of the government . 
in Manila , Philippine President Fidel Ramos called on the warring sides to resolve their dispute without further violence . 
&quot; The Philippines hopes that the two sides will settle their disputes peacefully and avoid further violence , &quot; Ramos said in a statement . 
Ramos said the Philippine government also hoped Phnom Penh would take measures to ensure the safety of about 500 Filipinos working in Cambodia . 
&quot; The Philippine embassy in Phnom Penh is closely monitoring the situation and has advised the members of the Filipino community to stay at home to avoid getting involved in the troubles , &quot; Ramos said . 
he said the embassy had adopted contingency plans &quot; which it can put into operation if necessary &quot; . 
a Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman told Reuters on Sunday that the ministry was closely watching the situation , and said : &quot; Our embassy in Phnom Penh is in close touch with Singaporean residents there . 
in Seoul , South Korean Foreign Ministry officials were still assessing the fighting in the Cambodian capital but a ministry official said he had heard plans were being made to evacuate about 300 South Korean nationals living in the country . 
no official comment was available from Malaysia &apos;s Foreign Ministry but a duty officer at the ministry said Malaysians in Cambodia had been advised to &quot; stay indoors &quot; . 
the New Zealand government , which is represented in Phnom Penh by the British embassy , said it had no reports of the 50 New Zealanders in the vicinity of the capital being in danger . 
&quot; It &apos;s extremely difficult , if not impossible , to get through at the moment &quot; , a senior Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters . 
meanwhile , there were differing opinions on how the fighting would affect Cambodia &apos;s admission to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , set for later this year . 
Ishtiaq Hoessein , a senior lecturer in political science at the National University of Singapore , told Reuters he thought the fighting would not necessarily affect Cambodia &apos;s admission , since ASEAN countries &quot; have already decided to let Cambodia in &quot; . 
&quot; It &apos;s already in the bag , isn &apos;t it ? 
&quot; , he said . 
however , he added , that didn &apos;t mean ASEAN countries were not concerned about political stability in Cambodia , or about how the situation would impact on Cambodia &apos;s ability to live up to its commitments to ASEAN . 
ASEAN , which groups Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia , Singapore , Thailand , the Philippines and Vietnam , plans to admit Burma , Laos and Cambodia this year . 
it consistently contends it does not want to interfere in members &apos; internal matters . 
&quot; When they said they could admit Cambodia , they were very optimistic , but they miscalculated . 
now they should postpone it until the country returns to stability and peace , &quot; the diplomat said . 
the diplomat said Thailand and Vietnam , as neighbours , were among the most likely countries to oppose Cambodia &apos;s early entry to the grouping .
