Brazilian striker Ronaldo celebrated his nomination as FIFA player of the year with a first-half hat-trick as Barcelona romped to a 6-0 win over Rayo Vallecano on Sunday . 
with the Spanish championship reaching the half-way point , Barcelona retain second place , three points behind Real Madrid , who were led to a 4-0 victory over Celta Vigo by another Brazilian , defender Roberto Carlos . 
with the nearest challengers stumbling and third-placed Deportivo Coruna now seven points adrift , the league title already looks to be a two-horse race . 
Barcelona were put on their way with early goals by defenders Luis Enrique and Sergi Barjuan before Ronaldo got his name on the score sheet with two strongly disputed strikes . 
in the first Ronaldo &apos;s shot bounced off Rayo keeper Pedro Contreras , a defender and a goalpost before the referee ruled that the ball had crossed the line . 
in the second the ball appeared to hit Ronaldo &apos;s hand as he bore down on goal . 
the Brazilian finished off the job with a penalty on the stroke of halftime , before limping off injured midway through the second half . 
&quot; After the award it was nice for him to score three goals , &quot; Barcelona coach Bobby Robson said . 
but the former England manager had harsh words for his critics after the demanding Camp Nou crowd whistled his team with the score at 5-0 . 
&quot; People complain about systems , but I don &apos;t know how you can score more than 50 goals without a system , &quot; said Robson whose side have scored 60 goals in their 21 league matches to date . 
&quot; I think ( the goals ) are because of the system , and the contribution of the players . 
Robson &apos;s counterpart at Real Madrid , former AC Milan boss Fabio Capello , saw his side come out on top in a drab game with Celta Vigo thanks to the individual brilliance of his players , most notably Roberto Carlos . 
the Brazilian defender blasted home the first with a swerving free-kick and set up Argentine midfielder Fernando Redondo for the second early in the second half . 
Raul Gonzalez made it three after combining with Clarence Seedorf , while Davor Suker made up for one of his worst performances of the season by knocking in the fourth . 
&quot; We &apos;re playing well , concentrating , scoring alot , it &apos;s a Real Madrid side that I like , &quot; said Capello afterwards . 
real meet Barcelona in a midweek Cup clash that could easily influence the league title race . 
other challengers had a miserable weekend . 
Deportivo slipped by losing 1-0 to bottom club Extremadura on Saturday , while fourth-placed Real Sociedad went down by the same score in the dying moments of their game at struggling Logrones . 
real Betis , in fifth , play at Valladolid on Monday , while the Spanish Football Federation agreed to postpone the game between Tenerife and sixth-placed Atletico Madrid after ten members of the champions &apos; squad went down with gastroenteritis . 
at the other end of the table Zaragoza have been joined by Extremadura on 15 points after their 2-1 defeat at strugglers Compostela . 
less than 20 months after taking the European Cup Winners &apos; Cup , Zaragoza are now six points adrift of a place that would save them from automatic relegation , a fate awaiting four teams this season .
