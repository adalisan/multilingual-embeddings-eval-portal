Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , mediating in a standoff between opposing political forces in Belarus , indicated on Friday he was optimistic a solution could be found . 
arriving with a smiling President Alexander Lukashenko at talks with Lukashenko &apos;s parliamentary rivals , Chernomrydin gave reporters a thumbs up sign . 
&quot; We are in a good mood , &quot; he said . 
earlier Belarus parliamentary leader Semyon Sharetsky held talks with Russian counterparts and said that he was &quot; very happy &quot; with the results of the meeting . 
Gennady Seleznyov , leader of Russia &apos;s lower house of parliament , said they had several offers to put on the table at the talks with Lukashenko , who has called a controversial referendum for Sunday on extending his powers . 
&quot; We have several compromise options which would lead to a &quot; zero &quot; ( option ) , &quot; Seleznyov said . 
the Belarus parliament has started impeachment proceedings against Lukashenko but indicated it might drop them if he compromises over the referendum . 
Interfax news agency quoted sources at the earlier Lukashenko-Chermomyrdin talks as saying they had reached a separate compromise under which the referendum could still go ahead . 
the two sides later started talks on a solution at Lukashenko &apos;s meeting house in central Minsk .
