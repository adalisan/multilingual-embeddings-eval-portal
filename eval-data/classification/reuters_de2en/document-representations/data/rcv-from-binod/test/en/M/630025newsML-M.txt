European oil swaps were stronger on Monday except for slightly easier Brent CFDs which lost up to five cents a barrel and low sulphur fuel , down up to $ 2 . 
gasoline gained $ 2 , heavy fuel $ 1 and naphtha $ 1 . 
CFDs edged down tentatively with June 2-6 pegged around -37 cents under July compared with -32 while next week went out to -34 cents under July against -31 on Friday . 
two trading houses concluded 2-6 June at -33 cents against July Brent while June 7-11 was done at -39 cents under September . 
gas oil crack spreads were steady with 3Q around $ 4.15 , 4Q at $ 4.80 and 1Q98 at $ 4.70 . 
gasoline swaps were about $ 2 stronger but took a back seat to the physical market that saw a number of barges trade around $ 207-210 fob Ara with $ 204.50 done for storage material . 
firmer crude , stronger NYMEX gasoline , July up 0.44 cent at 63.25 cents and long positions among a number of key players were all supportive elements to the rise . 
the U.K budget , in which the market expects gasoline excise to be increased , is to be held on July 3 . 
&quot; The budget has blown the June / July spread - it &apos;s now at $ 8 instead of $ 6 ( on Friday ) , &quot; said one dealer . 
July gasoline was done at $ 200 . 
heavy fuel rose about $ 1 a tonne with June trading at $ 84 . 
other deals were done p and c , but the day was viewed by many as quiet . 
low sulphur was also slow and levels succumbed to last week &apos;s bearish pressure of physical oversupply losing up to $ 2 a tonne . 
a June swap was done at $ 92.50 with July showing $ 1 or so contango . 
Naphtha swaps traded at $ 187 and $ 187.50 for June , steady , but July moved higher , valued at $ 189 . 
there was little consensus for July strength vis a vis unchanged June . 
some dealers said June had been overcooked last week while others said a good supply of promptish fob barrels was bearish .
