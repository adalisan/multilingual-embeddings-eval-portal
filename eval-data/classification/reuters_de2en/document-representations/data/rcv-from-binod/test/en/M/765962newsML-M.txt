Polish shares rebounded after four sessions of slight falls but analysts said that despite another likely gain on Thursday , signalled by stronger buying after price fixing , the market had little upside . 
they said the run-up to September &apos;s parliamentary poll and Wednesday &apos;s news the central bank would raise nominal rates should dampen buying in the weeks ahead . 
&quot; I think some of it ( a possible rate rise ) has already been discounted , as it has been discussed since the start of the floods , but the moment when the move happens it should cause a non-drastic fall , &quot; said Emil Onyszczuk of PBR brokerage . 
the main market &apos;s all-share WIG index rose 0.8 percent to 15,029.8 and turnover fell 11.8 percent to 134.8 million zlotys on both markets . 
the central bank president told daily Dziennik Prawa i Gospodarki in its Wednesday edition Lombard and discount rates would rise in the next few weeks and it would start collecting deposits to offset effects of government flood relief credit . 
the government may borrow as much as 2.5 billion zlotys from the central bank due to the flooding estimated to have caused damage of billions of dollars . 
Optimus rose the daily maximum 10 percent on Wednesday , a surge traders said might be speculative as no significant new information on the firm had been released this week . 
they said big , down 4.1 percent in light trade to 3.5 zlotys , was hurt by Tuesday &apos;s news it had sold shares in its issue to help refinance the acquisition of Bank Gdanski at 3.4 zlotys each . 
the previous price range was 3.3-5.3 zlotys .
