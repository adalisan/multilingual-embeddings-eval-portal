police investigating allegations that Alberto Tomba avoided paying taxes on sponsorship earnings searched the Italian Alpine skiing star &apos;s home on Friday , a magistrate said . 
investigating magistrate Enrico Cieri told Reuters that paramilitary and financial police carried out a search at a house owned by Tomba &apos;s parents near the northern town of Bologna . 
Tomba has his own apartment in the grounds . 
Cieri did not specify the exact nature of the accusations against Tomba but confirmed that public prosecutors in Bologna were investigating possible irregularities in the declaration of income from sponsorship and advertising deals . 
an employee at the firm , owned by Tomba &apos;s father Franco , which handles the financial affairs of the three-times Olympic gold medal winner said the company &apos;s offices were also searched . 
&quot; For us it was a normal fiscal examination , &quot; the employee , who asked not to be named , said . 
&quot; We do not even know what they were searching for ... We are awaiting the results . 
the employee said Tomba was training outside Bologna when the police arrived but his father showed them various documents relating to the skier &apos;s sponsorship interests . 
&quot; They did not take any ( documents ) away with them , &quot; the employee said . 
the flamboyant Tomba , a former policeman , has earned a fortune from a decade as the undisputed star of the skiing circuit . 
a gold medallist in the slalom and giant slalom at the 1988 Calgary Olympics , he successfully defended his giant title at the 1992 Albertville Games . 
he has also won two Olympic silver medals and two world titles . 
he has also had several brushes with the law . 
military prosecutors alleged last year he misused a flashing police light to skip a traffic jam in 1993 while he was still a police sergeant . 
he later left the force . 
he was also accused by a photographer in 1995 of falsely flashing a police badge during a brawl in a nightclub . 
they settled out of court . 
although he has cultivated a playboy image , Tomba and his father blame the Italian press for intruding into the family &apos;s off-piste private life . 
Tomba also gained much unwanted publicity when an Italian photographer sued him for injury to a hand sustained when the skier threw a heavy glass trophy at him after a race in alta Badia , Italy , in 1995 . 
the photographer had taken nude pictures , shot before the Calgary Olympics , which he then sold to a magazine and which were published in the summer of 1995 . 
Tomba signed a deal with an Italian television company this year to star in a mini-series to be filmed after the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics . 
he suffered injury and illness for much of the past season but won a slalom bronze at the 1997 world championships in front of his home crowd at Sestriere in January .
