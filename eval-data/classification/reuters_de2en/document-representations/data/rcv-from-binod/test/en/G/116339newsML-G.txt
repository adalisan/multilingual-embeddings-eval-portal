Classy goals by Scot John Collins , Nigerian Victor Ikpeba and youngster Thierry Henry helped Monaco upset Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-2 in their UEFA Cup second round first leg on Tuesday . 
Ikpeba made the score sheet twice as the Germans struggled to reproduce the same kind of crisp football which destroyed England &apos;s Arsenal in the last round . 
the French side opened the scoring in the 12th minute after a quick counter-attack . 
Ikpeba slipped the ball to Collins just outside the box and the Scottish midfielder fired it crisply into the left-hand corner with his left foot . 
seconds after Christian Hochstaetter had equalised for the Germans in the 57th minute , Ikpeba raced down the left flank and beat two Borussia defenders and Moenchengladbach goalkeeper Uwe Kamps before firing home . 
Borussia seemed to have avoided defeat when a long-range free-kick from Swede Patrik Andersson found the net in the 72nd minute . 
but just six minutes later Henry showed his blistering speed down the left wing and scoredr . 
Henry went close again shortly afterwards after another sprint down the left but Kamps just managed to tip his shot over the bar . 
in the dying seconds Ikpeba beat the Borussia offside trap and struck the ball inside the right-hand post . 
&quot; We were completely asleep in the first half , &quot; said Moenchengladbach coach Bernd Krauss . 
&quot; We saw what great players the French have . 
French football is probably ahead of the German game at the moment .
