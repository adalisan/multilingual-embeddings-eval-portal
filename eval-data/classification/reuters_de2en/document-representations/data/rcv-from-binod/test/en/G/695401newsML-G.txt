Barcelona presented Louis van Gaal as new coach on Monday , and with him the sweeping organisational changes which the former Ajax manager will bring to one of Europe &apos;s biggest clubs . 
&quot; I &apos;ve asked Barcelona to use a new structure , &quot; said van Gaal , who will work alongside predecessor as coach Bobby Robson in the new system . 
Robson , who still has a year left on his two-year contract , will stay on to superintend new signings . 
a further , as yet unnamed man , will manage Barcelona &apos;s extensive junior team network and make joint decisions in what van Gaal described as &apos; a kind of triumvirate &apos; . 
&quot; For the media the short term is important ... but for me the long term is important , &quot; said the Dutchman . 
van Gaal said he had been surprised to see the lack of professionalism in the Barcelona organisation . 
the Ajax side that van Gaal took to consecutive European Cup finals is known to be supported by one of the most organised structures in soccer , and the club has become a breeding ground for some of the continent &apos;s best players . 
van Gaal said he had been approached by Barcelona several years ago , but had to decided to stay on for a season in Amsterdam because of his daughters . 
&quot; Barcelona is a great city , but the club is even better . 
and with the great squad , I hope to continue with the success achieved at Ajax , &quot; said van Gaal . 
van Gaal said he would like to keep Ronaldo , the star Brazilian striker whose possible transfer to Inter Milan is currently in the hands of FIFA . 
&quot; If Ronaldo goes , I &apos;ll have to find somebody who fits into the team . 
van Gaal also expressed his admiration for fellow Dutchman Johan Cruyff , whose eight years as coach at the club ended acrimoniously last May . 
at that stage Barcelona rushed through the signing of Bobby Robson from Portugal &apos;s Porto . 
as if to show he had learned from one of Robson &apos;s biggest problems with Barcelona fans and local media , van Gaal promised to learn Spanish quickly . 
the former England manager was also present at the press conference . 
&quot; My first wish , not obligation , is to wish van Gaal and his team success -- they understand that word in Holland , &quot; said Robson . 
&quot; I can tell you that Louis van Gaal will get 100 per cent of support , loyaly , and honesty , and that if there is anything I can do to make his job easier , then he can rely on me . 
in his only season in charge Robson had lost favour with Barcelona fans as the league title slipped away to arch-rivals Real Madrid . 
but he did take the Spanish Super Cup and the European Cup Winner &apos;s Cup before rounding off with Saturday &apos;s memorable Spanish Cup victory . 
&quot; When I think that my last game with Barcelona as coach is to win the Spanish Cup , it is the most perfect finish , &quot; he said . 
ironically the favourite to fill the third key post in the new Barcelona structure is Lorenzo Serra Ferrer , manager of beaten Cup finalists Real Betis .
