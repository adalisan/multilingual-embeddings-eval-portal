U.S. stock index futures finished a listless , rangebound day mixed , as the market consolidated from all-time highs , traders and analysts said . 
they said activity slowed ahead of options expirations and allowed March Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500s to keep marginal gains . 
&quot; You don &apos;t want to sell into something when it usually rallies , &quot; one floor trader said about S &amp; P futures &apos; inclination to rally into the expiration of options on futures contracts . 
volume in March S &amp; Ps was estimated at 71,000 contracts , traders said . 
many traders , however , are looking for March S &amp; Ps to fall through the key psychological 800.00 level next week , as the contract corrects this week &apos;s spike into record highs . 
March S &amp; Ps rallied through 800.00 for the first time on February 12 and climbed to 820.40 on the following Wednesday without a consolidation period , let alone a correction . 
several traders said the market was closely watching bellwether technology stocks . 
&quot; The technology stocks are getting slammed , and those are the ones that led us up , &quot; another floor trader said . 
fair value was about 2.00 points over cash . 
Nikkei futures continued to expand gains , with March rising to 19,255 late in the day . 
traders and dealers are expected to roll positions into the June contract , which closed at a slight discount to March . 
at the end of pit trade , March S &amp; Ps were up 0.10 at 804.45 , KCBT Value Lines were down 0.10 at 714.90 , NYSE composites were up 0.70 at 422.05 , Nikkeis were up 200 at 19,220 , Midcap 400s were down 0.80 at 266.00 and Nasdaq 100s were 16.45 points lower at 867.00 .
