stocks tumbled from their dizzying heights on Friday as investors cashed in profits to end a record-shattering week . 
the Dow Jones industrial average fell 130.31 points , or 1.6 percent , to close at 7,890.46 just two days after it eclipsed 8,000 for the first time . 
the blue-chip average lost 31.36 points for the week . 
technology stocks , which had paced the market &apos;s recent rally , also led on the way down , taking their cue from Microsoft Corp. , which fell nine points to 140-1 / 2 after reporting earnings on Thursday . 
in the broader market , declining issues swamped advances 2,024 to 857 on volume of 585 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange , where trading volume for the week surged to a record . 
&quot; Without a doubt , it &apos;s profit-taking , &quot; said Frank Calta , managing director of institutional trading at Dain Bosworth . 
&quot; People used Microsoft as an excuse to sell . 
Microsoft said late on Thursday that earnings rose 88 percent in the latest quarter , but its stock had jumped 20 points in the days ahead of the report , and many investors saw the results as good but not great and opted to cash out . 
stocks also got hurt by a weak bond market , where attention turned to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s semi-annual testimony to Congress , scheduled for next Tuesday . 
analysts , who pore over the Fed Chairman &apos;s every utterance , will be especially on watch for echoes of earlier ruminations on market bubbles and &quot; irrational exuberance . 
&quot; This market is nervous right now , &quot; said Robert Froehlich , chief investment strategist at Kemper Funds . 
&quot; If Greenspan was concerned about a bubble with the Dow at 6,200 , what &apos;s he going to think at 8,000 ? 
the 30-year Treasury fell half a point , raising its yield to 6.53 percent from 6.49 percent at Thursday &apos;s close . 
bond prices and yields move in opposite directions . 
one encouraging sign for the stock market was that investors remained extremely active , even through the traditionally slow summer season . 
NYSE volume on Friday pushed weekly volume to 2.95 billion shares and smashed the old mark of 2.82 billion shares set in the week ended on Jan . 24 , 1997 . 
&quot; Given where we are in the summer , I thought that was particularly impressive , &quot; said Peter Green , vice president of technical research at Gruntal &amp; Co . &quot; Markets tend to get in trouble during periods of light selling and no buying and this showed buyers were still active . 
among individual issues , Motorola Inc. fell 7-1 / 4 to 81-3 / 4 a day after the company , in a meeting with analysts , said profit margins at its paging business were likely to shrink . 
Stanley Works fell 2-1 / 16 to 44-7 / 16 after it announced a steep loss stemming from a restructuring . 
the company said it plans to cut 4,500 jobs and close nearly half its plants . 
America Online fell 3-3 / 4 to 64 after Goldman Sachs removed the online service provider from the firm &apos;s list of priority investments . 
the Nasdaq composite index fell 20.86 points to 1,547.99 . 
the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s composite index of 500 stocks fell 16.31 to 915.30 . 
the American Stock Exchange index was off 3.75 to 633.59 . 
the NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks fell 6.99 to 475.97 . 
the average share was down 66 cents . 
the Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE , American and Nasdaq issues -- was 8,697.781 , down 125.088 or 1.42 percent .
