China has granted a six-month extension for duty-free imports of capital equipment by foreign-invested projects launched before April 1996 , the China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday . 
the exemption for foreign-funded ventures with investment of less than $ 30 million would be extended to the end of June this year , and for projects worth more than $ 30 million to the end of June 1998 , it said . 
the extension would quash foreign investors &apos; fears that they might not be able to obtain needed capital goods before the exemption expires , it said , quoting Xu Yaping , a deputy director-general of the cabinet &apos;s Special Economic Zone Office . 
&quot; Individual companies with difficulty meeting the deadlines can appeal to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation for more time , &quot; Xu said . 
the tax changes were aimed at removing certain privileges granted to foreign-invested companies as Beijing reduced tariff levels on about 5,000 import items . 
China has been trimming its average import duties as part of its campaign to comply with requirements to join the World Trade Organisation . 
but it has come under pressure from domestic manufacturers who are unhappy with increased competition from imported goods . 
many of these companies argue that if the domestic market is to be opened up to competition from abroad , foreign companies operating in China should no longer be entitled to special treatment .
