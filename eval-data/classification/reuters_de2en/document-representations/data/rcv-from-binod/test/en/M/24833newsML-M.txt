U.S. stocks are expected to open steady with the market awaiting another burst of economic data as well as a speech by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan . 
banking stocks could be sparked by a merger pact between NationsBank and boatmen &apos;s Bancshares . 
&quot; We again have a bunch of numbers coming up and depending on how it affects bonds , it &apos;ll affect stocks , &quot; said Hildegard Zagorski , analyst for prudential Securities . 
&quot; We had a big selloff yesterday and we have weak markets overseas . 
&quot; On the surface things don &apos;t look too bad ( for potentially scary economic releases later today ) but the thing is , analysts have made estimates and data have come in exceeding them -- that &apos;s when bonds tanked , &quot; she said . 
Alan Ackerman , market strategist at Fahnestock and Co , said the market could see a low volume rally . 
while the market is very sensitive to the Fed , there &apos;s little selling pressure today , and there may be some preholiday bargain hunting . 
but it will be a light volume session , &quot; Ackerman said . 
U.S. markets are closed on Monday .
