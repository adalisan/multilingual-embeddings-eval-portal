LME copper and aluminium drifted lower in sluggish activity on Thursday afternoon , but the markets were well-underpinned and only pausing , traders and analysts said . 
turnover was light due to the May Day holiday in much of Europe and the Golden Week celebrations in Japan . 
Britain observes a holiday on Monday , May 5 , so LME activity is likely to be muted on Friday as well . 
&quot; The closes are not too positive , but I don &apos;t think you can read too much into it , &quot; said analyst Martin Squires of broker Rudolf Wolff . 
three months copper finished the afternoon kerb $ 19 weaker at $ 2,360 a tonne after failing to sustain a move in the morning to $ 2,382 . 
the premium of cash over three months material eased to $ 75 / $ 80 from about $ 88 on Wednesday evening . 
traders said the downside was limited due to the backwardation and supply side difficulties . 
a small group of miners at Chile &apos;s huge Escondida mine were on strike , as were workers at Quebrada Blanca , another Chilean mine . 
&quot; And with the smelter shutdowns , it &apos;s all a bit worrying , &quot; Squires said , referring to the maintenance closure of the Kennecott smelter in the U.S. and work planned on the Huelva smelter in Spain . 
support was pegged at $ 2,350 and at a trendline around $ 2,320 . 
resistance was seen at $ 2,380 and $ 2,400 . 
traders were unsure whether stocks would show another build on Friday , but more material was expected to leave Singapore , one said . 
aluminium also ended weaker after failing at $ 1,647 in the morning . 
it lost $ 17 to end the day at $ 1,628 . 
support was pegged at a chart gap at $ 1,614- $ 1,620 . 
the others were lacklustre , holding to recent ranges . 
nickel fell $ 30 to $ 7,350 , while zinc lost $ 4 to $ 1,269 . 
tin gained $ 10 to $ 5,710 and lead added $ 2 to $ 626 , continuing to recover from its slide to an 18-month low of $ 615 on Tuesday . 
Alloy shed $ 10 to $ 1,505 .
