India &apos;s Congress party said on Saturday that it would support the United Front coalition in forming a new government if the alliance replaced ousted Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda as leader . 
&quot; If they come up with a new leader , we will support them , &quot; Congress spokesman Ved Prakash told Reuters by telephone in the Indian capital . 
&quot; We will not press our claim to form the government . 
Congress president Sitaram Kesri provoked the downfall of DEVE Gowda &apos;s 10-month-old government when he withdrew his party &apos;s support . 
on Friday , DEVE Gowda &apos;s coalition lost a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament . 
Kesri had earlier said he wanted to stake a claim to form a fresh government . 
but Congress officials said he was no longer pressing the claim 
earlier on Saturday , Kesri said his first priority was to avoid elections that could ensue if the United Front and Congress failed to agree on a successor to DEVE Gowda . 
the Press Trust of India quoted Congress leader Oscar Fernandes as saying Kesri had told party members that there was no question of going to the polls , that he was not a contender for any office and that the United Front should elect a new leader and Congress would support it .
