shares on the Lima stock exchange closed lower Tuesday as investors remained sidelined waiting for third quarter earnings reports , brokers said . 
a rebound Wednesday was unlikely as the economy &apos;s slower- than-expected growth has also made investors reluctant to enter the market , they added . 
Tuesday , the General Index .IGRA fell 0.82 percent to 1,554.25 points , while the blue-chip Selective Index .ISEL dropped 1.12 percent to 2,098.64 points , according to preliminary stock figures . 
&quot; Investors showed they prefer to see financial results and improved ( gross domestic ) product figures before deciding to enter the market , &quot; said Luis Ramirez of local brokerage Macrovalores . 
only one blue-chip stock has so far published its third quarter results -- tin-miner Minsur , which remained stable Tuesday at 25.00 soles in 5.24 million soles worth of trade . 
the Peruvian economy grew 2.0 percent in the first eight months of the year , compared to 8.4 percent in the same period of 1995 , the government announced . 
while investors recognized as prudent the government &apos;s policy of slowing the economy down at the beginning of the year , they had been hoping for a quicker recovery in the second half than has so far been seen , brokers said . 
in a total of 2,143 trades , 36 stocks fell , 35 were stable and 25 rose in volume of 64.2 million ( $ 25.0 million ) . 
a single cross-trade between local brokerages Argos and Surinvest in the shares of pension fund AFP Horizonte accounted for 55 percent of the day &apos;s total volume . 
accounting for 11 percent of the market &apos;s volume , benchmark Telefnica del Per was the most heavily traded stock after this cross-trade , as it fell 0.88 percent to 5.65 soles .
