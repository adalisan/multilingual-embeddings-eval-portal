U.S. debt futures ended sharply lower in a holiday-shortened session , pummeled by technical deterioration after strong U.S. data . 
June Treasury bond futures slid more than a full point , obliterating several support levels and hitting the lowest price since last fall . 
June collapsed through the seven-percent long bond yield equivalent at 108-09 / 32 and breached Wednesday &apos;s low of 108-04 / 32 before tumbling into the bottom half of the 107-00 handle . 
traders noted aggressive dealer selling and sell stops on the decline . 
what many had expected to be a quiet shortened holiday session turned into a full-fledged sell-off , largely because of signs of economic strength in this morning &apos;s data . 
weekly jobless claims fell to 310,000 in the week ended March 22 , compared with a revised 314,000 a week earlier . 
June T-bonds put in their first session low of the day at 108-12 / 32 after the claims report . 
later , a jump in February existing home sales yanked June to 108-6 / 32 before technical deterioration set in , traders said . 
February sales rose 9.0 percent to a 4.26 million annual rate . 
&quot; It was a meltdown , but it may have been partially exacerbated by the low turnout , &quot; a Eurodollar broker said . 
he said the market was pricing in another interest rate hike in May and said strong economic figures were &quot; just not letting up . 
&quot; The economy appears to have strength going forward and technicals are really poor right now , &quot; he said . 
he pegged near-term downside Eurodollar targets at 93.92 in June and 93.59 in September . 
&quot; We could see that Monday , &quot; he said , but added that the market might first correct slightly from today &apos;s sell-off . 
Thursday &apos;s collapse highlighted a dim technical outlook , some said . 
June T-bonds slid as low as 107-11 / 32 , below the 107-16 / 32 low set September 25 . 
traders said the next support level to watch was 106-22 / 32 , the September 19 low . 
&quot; I think the first stop is 104-00 , then 92-00 , &quot; one bond trader said of June T-bonds . 
trade ended early today ahead of a three-day weekend for the Good Friday holiday . 
one trader noted moderate to heavy volume during the shortened session . 
at the close , June bonds were off 1-3 / 32 points at 107-12 / 32 , 10-year notes were down 21 / 32 at 105-18 / 32 , June bills fell 0.035 to 94.535 , June Euros lost 0.035 to 93.995 , and September Euros lost 0.075 to 93.685 .
