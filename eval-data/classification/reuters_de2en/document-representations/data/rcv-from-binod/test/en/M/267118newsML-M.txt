the dollar closed mostly higher on Thursday , helped by a surprise drop in the United States international trade deficit , which hinted the strong U.S. currency may not be restraining U.S. exports . 
fueled largely by a jump in aircraft exports , the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services contracted 30.2 percent in October , the Commerce Department said Thursday . 
the deficit fell to $ 7.99 billion from $ 11.44 billion in September . 
traders often purchase dollars when the deficit shrinks . 
in this case , the market got a much smaller gap than the $ 10.4 billion economists polled by Reuters expected . 
&quot; The only reason why the dollar went up is because of the trade number , &quot; said John Gariano , vice president at Sumitomo Bank in New York . 
&quot; If it was anything less than $ 9 billion down , they were going to buy dollars , which they did . 
although the dollar rushed to a high of 1.5625 marks , triggering stop-loss buying above 1.5580 on the way , and rose to a new two-year high at 1.3410 Swiss francs after the trade data , it gave back some of its gains during the day . 
the dollar ended at 1.5579 / 84 marks , up from 1.5550 / 55 at the open . 
but it slipped to 113.98 / 08 yen from 114.05 / 10 . 
the dollar hovered around 114 yen for most of the session , making little headway after the data because the bilateral trade gap with Japan widened . 
the 31-percent jump in the deficit with Japan mirrored Japanese November trade data on Wednesday , which showed a surge in Japanese auto exports to the U.S. due to the cheaper yen against the dollar this year . 
&quot; The trade numbers overall here are better . 
but with Japan they are not going to get any better with this dollar the way it is , &quot; said John Barlow , senior foreign exchange dealer at Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale . 
the trade data compare U.S. earnings from sales overseas to U.S. payments for foreign merchandise and services such as banking and insurance . 
a falling deficit indicates improving net revenues from exports , boosting economic growth forecasts . 
traders also said the dollar garnered psychological support from Wall Street , where stock and bond prices stormed higher on Thursday . 
bonds rallied despite the strong trade data , which might have suggested interest rates should rise . 
the Dow Jones industrial stock average closed up nearly 127 points on Thursday , while the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1-1 / 2 points and its yield fell below 6.60 percent . 
&quot; The reason for the move up , basically , is that the trade figures showed the economy is moving pretty good , &quot; Barlow said . 
&quot; Yet the asset markets are holding on , so I think that is like a double-bonus effect . 
elsewhere , the dollar ended at 1.3385 / 95 Swiss francs , up from 1.3330 / 40 at the open . 
the pound fell to $ 1.6635 / 45 from $ 1.6662 / 72 . 
the Australian dollar closed at $ 0.7940 / 45 compared to $ 0.7944 / 49 at the open .
