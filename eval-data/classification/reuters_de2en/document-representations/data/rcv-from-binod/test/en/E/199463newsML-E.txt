Bulgaria &apos;s domestic debt rose by 27.7 billion levs in October to 668.3 billion levs because of new issues of government securities and a fall in the value of the Lev , Finance Ministry figures showed . 
nine new treasury paper issues were sold last month to finance the government budget deficit , boosting domestic debt by 10.8 billion levs , figures showed . 
the Lev &apos;s fall to 240 to the dollar from 230 increased the debt by 10 billion levs as it boosted the price of dollar-denominated bad loan bonds and treasury bonds issued to compensate depositors in insolvent banks . 
this year the Finance Ministry has so far issued $ 61 million worth of floater coupon T-bonds to guarantee hard currency deposits in banks which the central bank wants to close down . 
direct credit to the government from the central bank , the State Savings Bank and State Insurance Institute rose to 49.4 billion levs in October from 42.4 billion in September , boosting domestic debt by a further seven billion levs . 
the Finance Ministry recently said it planned to meet most maturity and coupon payments on treasury papers by rollover issues of government securities to bridge the budget gap . 
the central government budget deficit topped the annual target by nine percent in October , rising to 88 billion levs . 
discussions about the introduction of a currency board system , as proposed by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , have raised deep concern among banks , a commercial banker told Reuters . 
&quot; Some banks are trying to get rid of treasury paper in their portfolios through buy-back operations with the central bank ahead of maturity , &quot; said the banker , who declined to be named . 
banks authorised to sell treasury paper to individuals and firms were under pressure to buy it back ahead of maturity as Bulgarians feared for the safety of their lev-denominated investments if a currency board system was introduced . 
individuals and non-banking institutions held 61.4 billion levs worth of paper at the end of October or 23.4 percent of the total par value of issues in circulation . 
issuing and servicing of bad loan bonds amounted to some 80 percent of total internal debt , the finance ministry said in a report made available to Reuters . 
&quot; State companies &apos; bad debts should have been covered by sales of their assets and it is still possible by speeding up privatisation , &quot; the report said . 
Bulgaria issued two types of bad debt bonds in 1994 and 1995 worth 32 billion levs and $ 1.8 billion respectively to cover non-performing loans extended to state companies by banks before 1991 . 
&quot; It is highly advisable to encourage debt-for-equity swaps to cut the domestic debt and to stop the transfer of company losses to the state , &quot; the report said . 
finance Ministry officials were not available for further comment .
