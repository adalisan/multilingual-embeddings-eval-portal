Peintre Celebre had little 
difficulty in following up his French Derby win , completing a 
Group one double in the Grand Prix de Paris at rain- softened 
Longchamp on Sunday . 
Andre Fabre &apos;s Colt now heads for a mouthwatering clash with 
Helissio and several other top-class performers in the King 
month . 
the 5-2 on shot was always travelling comfortably for 
Olivier Peslier , took over from English raider Royal Amaretto 
with 300 metres to go and held on for a comfortable two length 
success from Ithaki , the mount of Cash Asmussen with Shaka , the 
criterium de Saint-Cloud winner , in third . 
Peslier said : &quot; Peintre Celebre again gave me a very good 
feel and it will be an interesting clash with Helissio at 
Ascot . 
Peslier , for contractual reasons , is committed to riding 
Peintre Celebre at Ascot . 
Helissio , partnered by Peslier when 
the pair won last year &apos;s Prix de l &apos;Arc de Triomphe , will be 
ridden by Asmusseen . 
Peintre Celebre also underlined Fabre &apos;s excellent record in 
the Grand Prix de Paris , giving the champion trainer a sixth win 
in the mile and a quarter ( 2-km ) race .
