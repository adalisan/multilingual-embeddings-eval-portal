Chilean blue chips on Wednesday closed a shade higher in lackluster activity as investors awaited release of the fourth-quarter corporate results , traders said . 
the market is seen opening unsettled with attention focused on power company Endesa , which is expected to post its results on Thursday afternoon , Pablo Salcedo , head of research at ING Barings , said . 
the 40-share index ended up 0.26 percent at 108.08 points . 
the general index gained 0.1 percent to 5,163.01 points . 
Endesa , which has been hammered recently amid speculation over its results , closed 1.26 percent higher at 242 pesos . 
declining issues included glassmaker Cristales , down 2.82 percent at 2,900 pesos , telecom telex , down 2.11 percent at 930 pesos , and brewery CCU , which lost 0.74 percent at 1,350 pesos . 
another reason that Chilean stocks were generating so little interest was investors have been waiting for a sign that the central bank may ease its tight credit policy , traders said . 
turnover shrank to 6.2 billion pesos from nine billion pesos Tuesday . 
on Thursday , the Bolsa will focus on Endesa &apos;s earnings , which are expected to be weak because of this year &apos;s drought and lower generating prices , dealers said . 
the drought has caused water shortages at the company &apos;s dams , forcing it to buy expensive power from other producers .
