Swiss Christian groups are raising cash for Holocaust survivors as a goodwill gesture amid charges that Switzerland &apos;s banks are hoarding unclaimed bank accounts of Hitler &apos;s victims . 
Willy Vogelsang , a spokesman for the Swiss Friends of Judeo-Christians , told the Swiss news agency ATS on Monday that nearly $ 90,000 had been raised so far to be given directly to the survivors of the Holocaust in Switzerland and abroad . 
part of the cash was raised at a weekend protest in the capital Berne by Christian worshippers and nuns , who prayed to God to forgive Switzerland for its wartime treatment of Jews . 
the controversy has prompted soul-searching among the Swiss to reassess their past in World War Two , when Switzerland turned back 30,000 refugees trying to escape Hitler , most of them Jews . 
it has also turned into a potentially costly public relations disaster for the wealthy Alpine country , with New York state mulling whether to revoke the licences of Swiss banks . 
the state banking superintendent , Neil Levin , started talks in Switzerland on Monday to probe whether big Swiss banks operating in New York between 1939 and 1945 could still be holding any Holocaust accounts from the era . 
the big three Swiss banks confirmed talks with Levin were under way , but declined to give any details . 
the Swiss banks say they already turned over any dormant accounts long ago . 
stung into action by international pressure , Swiss banks have agreed to work with Jewish groups to go over their secret banking records and look into claims that banks are profitting from Jewish assets . 
to try to mend fences , the three biggest Swiss banks set up a $ 70 million fund last week in memory of Holocaust victims . 
at the weekend , industrialists pledged to contribute money as well . 
it is unclear whether this will satisfy New York State , which has moved to curb business ties by deciding to stop placing short-term deposits in Swiss banks until it is sure they have no money of Holocaust victims or their heirs .
