with spates of economic and political turmoil likely to continue hampering other Latin American countries , Brazil &apos;s economy should glitter amid the region &apos;s unsettled dust , Morgan Stanley &amp; Co economist Ernest Brown said in a report issued on Monday . 
Brazil has all of the trappings for Latam &apos;s best economic story of 1997 : a stable political environment , stronger consumer spending , an efficient banking system and an ability to resist external shocks , Brown said . 
although President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is not assured a second term , &quot; the odds favor his re-election , &quot; Brown said . 
credited with slowing inflation to single-digit levels , Cardoso is widely respected inside Brazil , Brown said . 
&quot; ( Cardoso &apos;s ) technocrats have figured out how to get reforms implemented intra-constitutionally , and the Brazilian state governors want most reforms and privatizations , &quot; the analyst said . 
turning to economics , Brown said Brazilian consumers may contribute to the positive growth in 1997 . 
he said that consumer demand is moderating enough in Brazil so that interest rates can continue to come down -- which is basically what financial markets are looking to see . 
&quot; The available year-end evidence suggests that a second-half 1996 spending surge may now be ending , &quot; he said . 
&quot; A borrowing binge and lagging raises for civil servants have helped to throttle back demand . 
Brown noted that Brazilian consumers would likely prompt a core of banks to make loans to support the domestic economy next year . 
additionally , &quot; Brazil &apos;s economy is likely to be the least affected by any negative shocks originating in global financial markets , &quot; he said . 
that was because of the sheer size of the Brazilian economy and the country &apos;s reduced dependence on any single currency or foreign country , he said . 
&quot; Our preference for Brazil is partly based on our strong belief that there is strong potential for falling interest rates in the country , ( which ) hasn &apos;t been fully appreciated by financial market participants , &quot; he said . 
to be sure , Brazil has to keep its overall fiscal deficit at less than 5.0 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in order for that to happen , Brown said . 
&quot; We think this is likely , but freely admit that budgetary surprises are possible , &quot; he said .
