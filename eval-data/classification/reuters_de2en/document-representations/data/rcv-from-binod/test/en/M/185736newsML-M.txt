Canadian spot natural gas prices jumped in busy trade again on Wednesday as cold weather in Alberta caused problems with some gas plants and utilities maintained their demand , traders said . 
&quot; Some of the plants in the province had some electrical problems because of the dense fog , &quot; said a Calgary-based marketer . 
Alberta has had ice fog and snow over the past week . 
&quot; Also , utilities have been buying day gas and there is not much withdrawal ( of gas from storage ) , &quot; he said . 
traders said prices were expected to climb higher by the weekend , with temperatures in southern Alberta forecast to dip to a frosty low of minus-25 Celsius ( -13 Fahrenheit ) Sunday . 
at the borders , prices at Sumas , Washington fell by 15 cents on the week to trade in the US $ 2.10 / 2.15 range , as warmer weather on the U.S. West Coast eased demand . 
gas at Niagara , Ontario climbed about 17 cents from November 6 to trade at about US $ 3.17 per mmBtu . 
less storage volume was being withdrawn this week than in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast where prices softened , marketers said .
