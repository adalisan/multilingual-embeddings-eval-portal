Taiwan share prices closed mildly higher on Saturday as electronics stocks continued their torrid streak to help the market overcome a malaise created by the central bank &apos;s rate hikes , brokers said . 
the weighted index opened 1.40 percent higher at 10,141.25 , gave in to some profit-takings late in the session but held on for a gain of 0.47 percent or 47.34 points to close at 10,048.90 . 
the central bank on Thursday announced a modest tightening of monetary policy by raising the rediscount rate to 5.25 percent from 5.00 and accommodations against secured loans to 5.625 percent from 5.375 , effective from Friday . 
the stock market has shown a muted response to the tightening . 
it eased by a mild 0.64 percent on Friday and resumed its uptrend on Saturday behind a 3.27-percent rise by electronics . 
&quot; The market basically ignored the central bank &apos;s rate cuts today ( Saturday ) , thanks to extreme bullishness in electronics , &quot; said Allen Huang , fund manager for National Securities . 
but other sectors saw lacklustre performances -- with heavily weighted financials falling 0.96 percent , textiles down 1.16 percent and plastics easing 0.48 percent . 
&quot; You can tell that most of the stock investments are concentrated in electronics , &quot; Huang said . 
&quot; The other sectors may not see stronger gains until electronics begin to see profit-taking , &quot; he added . 
electronics stocks , buoyed by rising sales forecasts , have been largely responsible for Taiwan &apos;s stock bull run that has driven the index up more than 100 percent since March 1996 . 
brokers said they expected the index to continue to seek a higher upside on Monday .
