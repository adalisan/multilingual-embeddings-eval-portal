Japan &apos;s industrial output for March is expected to show a fall of 2.1 percent against the previous month , an average of economists &apos; forecasts showed on Friday . 
but they said output was still rising as an overall trend . 
industrial output data for March and fiscal 1996 / 97 , and forecasts for April and May , will be released on Monday at 1.30 p.m. ( 0430 GMT ) . 
forecasts of economists polled by Reuters ranged between falls of 1.4 percent and 3.2 percent in March compared with a Trade Ministry survey showing major manufacturers &apos; predicting a 2.0 percent drop . 
the economists said output , which also fell 3.7 percent month-on-month in February , would continue to slip in reaction to brisk output in January , when it climbed 5.6 percent . 
manufacturers , in particular carmakers , reduced output due to an expected winding down in demand after consumers rushed to make large purchases ahead of a sales tax rise on April 1 , they said . 
&quot; carmakers , the driving force of output , are putting the brakes on somewhat , &quot; said Yasuhiko Ushikubo , an economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan . 
but economists said that in year-on year terms output would remain at high levels . 
their forecasts ranged between 6.2 percent and 8.5 percent . 
&quot; The industrial sector had been doing a lot better than the rest of the economy because of the weaker yen , &quot; said Richard Jerram , chief economist at ING Barings in Tokyo . 
some added , however , that although they expected rises in month-on-month terms for April and May , the April-June quarter was likely to fall into negative territory compared with the previous quarter . 
&quot; The January-March quarter will on average be quite high because January &apos;s figure was so strong , so April-June figures will look bad in comparison , &quot; said Mamoru Yamazaki , an economist at Paribas Capital Markets .
