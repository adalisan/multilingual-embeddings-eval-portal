Brazilian stocks closed mildly higher led by rises in power shares but trade was weak amid an absence of foreign investors ahead of Monday &apos;s Memorial Day holiday in the United States , brokers said . 
&quot; It was dead . 
there was no news and it seems a lot of people in New York left early for the holiday weekend , &quot; said one local broker . 
the Sao Paulo bourse &apos;s Bovespa index of 48 most-traded shares ended up 0.17 percent at 10,764 points on volume valued at 552.7 million reais ( $ 521 million ) . 
brokers said volume was down from recent daily averages as many foreign investors were absent from the session , apparently having taken off early for the long holiday in the United States . 
markets are closed on Monday both in the U.S. and Britain . 
the Bolsa &apos;s rise was led by increases in electrical sector stocks , with the Bolsa &apos;s Electrical Energy Index up 1.82 percent at 2,829 points . 
among rising power issues was blue-chip Eletrobras preferred B , which ended 1.38 percent higher at 513.00 reais , and Minas Gerais state &apos;s Cemig preferred , which closed up 0.63 percent at 47.80 reais . 
trade was dominated by leading blue-chip Telebras , whose benchmark preferred closed 0.36 percent higher at 137.50 reais , while its common shares ended 0.39 percent down at 128.00 reais . 
Telebras regularly accounts for 60 to 65 percent of trade on the Sao Paulo bourse . 
among other top blue chips , recently privatized miner CIA Vale do Rio Doce dropped 1.2 percent to end at 24.60 reais . 
Petrobras &apos; preferred declined after Friday &apos;s sale of one billion shares on the Rio de Janeiro Bolsa for 240.99 million reais ( $ 225.22 million ) , or 240.99 reais per lot of 1,000 shares . 
&quot; The price was slightly below the price it was already trading at , &quot; a dealer said . 
the issue closed down 1.22 percent at 242.00 reais in Sao Paulo .
