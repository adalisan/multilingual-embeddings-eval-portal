Romania &apos;s Finance Ministry said it would launch an issue of 177.05 billion lei in 91-day treasury bills to finance part of this year &apos;s budget deficit . 
the new bills , which mature on January 16 , 1997 , will be offered on Thursday with a coupon giving an annual yield equal to the three-month Bucharest Interbank Bid Rate ( BUBID ) set five working days ahead of public subscription . 
the January-August budget deficit stood at 1.9 trillion lei and is forecast to expand to 4.27 trillion by end-1996 . 
last week the Finance Ministry launched fresh T-bills worth 1.0 trillion lei to be placed in three public subscriptions . 
banks have bought some 380 billion lei of the total 1.0 trillion so far . 
the rest will be offered on October 18 and 25 with an annual yield of one percentage point above the three-month BUBID set five days ahead of the session .
