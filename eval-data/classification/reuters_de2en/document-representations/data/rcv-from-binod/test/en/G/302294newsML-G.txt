Paris St Germain must forget the sweet weather and leisurely pace of their winter preparation in the exotic Indian Ocean isle of Reunion when they host Juventus in the first leg of the European Supercup on Wednesday . 
the Cupwinners Cup holders returned from Reunion to the cold of Paris on Sunday and Brazilian coach Ricardo warned them they were facing hard work in 1997 . 
&quot; We were leading Monaco by eight points shortly before the break and we lost that lead . 
it is unacceptable . 
in 1997 , you &apos;ll have to work and run until you vomit , if it &apos;s necessary , &quot; he told his troops in the plane back . 
PSG face a crucial test at leaders Monaco when the league resumes next week . 
in the meantime , they start the new year the hard way by hosting the European champions at a frozen Parc des Princes . 
but he added that the Juventus match would be a good test of the efficency of that preparation . 
Ricardo still has injury problems to solve as the year begins . 
his compatriot Leonardo , who has been the leading force for PSG this season , has not yet fully recovered from a thigh injury . 
Ricardo hinted he may however field him for a few minutes at the end of the match , if things went wrong . 
Central defender Alain Roche , who is nursing a lingering knee injury , will also be missing . 
the French international is unlikely to be fit in time for the Monaco clash . 
the Parisians will also have to do without Portuguese hopeful Daniel Kenedy , who has not fully recovered from an ankle injury . 
defender Benoit Cauet , who is suspended , is the only other absentee in PSG &apos;s ranks . 
the only other uncertainty is whether Ricardo will pick Panama &apos;s striker Julio Cesar Dely Valdes or new recruit Cyrille Pouget . 
the former French international , signed from Switezerland &apos;s Servette during the break , scored PSG &apos;s two goals in their 2-2 draw against Mauritius in a friendly last week .
