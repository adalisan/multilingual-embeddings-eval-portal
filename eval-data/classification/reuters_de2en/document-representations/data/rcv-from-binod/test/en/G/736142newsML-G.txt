U.S. &quot; green beret &quot; troops will go to Senegal and Uganda next week to start training African soldiers for a proposed peacekeeping force for the continent , the State Department said on Thursday . 
spokesman Nicholas Burns said about 120 trainers would arrive on or about July 21 , most of them from the 3rd Special Forces Group in Fort Bragg , North Carolina . 
the move is part of a so-called African Crisis Response Initiative that Washington has been developing since last year . 
it stemmed from the 1994 genocide , civil war and refugee crisis in Rwanda that the outside world failed to prevent . 
burns said the idea was &quot; to create highly effective , rapidly deployable peacekeeping units which can operate jointly in the event of a humanitarian crisis in Africa , or if there is a need for a traditional peacekeeping operation . 
he told a news briefing the training would be based on a common peacekeeping doctrine , and that the supply of U.S. communications equipment would enable units to work together more effectively . 
burns said training was also expected to start soon in other African countries . 
U.S. press reports have spoken of Tunisia , Ethiopia , Mali , Malawi and Ghana . 
the State Department said last month that there was no plan for any U.S. forces to take part in actual peacekeeping operations in Africa . 
many details of the proposed peace force remain vague , and Burns said Washington would hold further talks with African countries , the Organisation of African Unity and the United Nations &quot; to further define the potential of this initiative &quot; . 
&quot; We think it &apos;s very important ... that African problems need to be handled by Africans themselves , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We hope that by expanding training opportunities for Senegal and Uganda and other countries , we might contribute to that effort , understanding that , obviously , African countries need to make these decisions on their own .
