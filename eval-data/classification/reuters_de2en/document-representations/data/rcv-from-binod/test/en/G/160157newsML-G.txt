President Bill Clinton &apos;s hopes of scoring a landslide election victory next Tuesday may be fading and some pollsters and analysts are beginning to predict a closer finish than previously expected . 
the issue that may have loosened Clinton &apos;s grip on the race may have been campaign finance reform , with revelations that Asian business interests were big donors to the Democratic Party . 
and the man who may have best captured the issue was Reform Party candidate Ross Perot . 
&quot; The fundraising scandals have provided the tinder and Ross Perot provided the spark , &quot; said University of Cincinnati pollster Alfred Tuchfarber . 
the latest Reuters daily tracking poll showed Republican Bob Dole cutting Clinton &apos;s lead to only 5.5 percentage points . 
but other polls still have Clinton well in the lead . 
two surveys by ABC and the hotline political newsletter said Clinton &apos;s lead was 12 points , while the Gallup poll and a Washington Post poll said it was 16 points . 
however some state surveys suggested the race was tightening . 
in Georgia , a previously wide Clinton lead has evaporated . 
in Ohio , Clinton &apos;s lead was down to five points and falling daily , according to Tuchfarber . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be a late night , both nationally and in Ohio . 
I honestly believe the election is now too close to call , &quot; he said . 
most other analysts would not go that far , although several said a last-minute tightening of the race would not be surprising . 
in 1992 , Clinton led by 12 percentage points a week before the elction and wound up winning by five points . 
if Clinton fails to win 50 percent of the popular vote , he will begin a second term without the decisive mandate he has been seeking . 
any erosion in his support also reduces the chances of the Democrats capturing control of Congress . 
analysts are now virtually unanimous in predicting that the Republicans will hold the Senate and most also expect them to keep control of the House of Representatives . 
Clinton finally addressed the campaign finance reform issue on Friday in a speech in California , after taking a battering from Dole and Perot for two weeks . 
he proposed an overhaul of campaign finance laws for congressional candidates , including a total ban on so-called &quot; soft money &quot; from corporations and interest groups . 
he also echoed Dole &apos;s call for a ban on contributions by non-U.S. citizens . 
but the question may be whether Clinton waited too long before speaking out . 
&quot; Of course it was a mistake . 
his silence implied some kind of complicity . 
it definitely hurt , &quot; said Gregory Valliere of the Washington Research Group , who provides political analysis for Wall Street institutions . 
Valliere said some weak Clinton supporters might also be giving Dole a last look before finally casting their votes . 
Fordham University political scientist Tom DeLuca said anti-Asian overtones in the attacks on foreign finance contributions were stirring the passions of some voters , especially conservatives . 
&quot; There &apos;s a foreign-bashing undertone to this issue which may be playing well among some , &quot; he said . 
daily newspapers reports about Democratic fundraising in a Buddhist temple and about the activities of John Huang , a former Commerce Department official who had frequent access to the White House , have hurt Clinton . 
Huang raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from Asian-Americans and Asian interests for the Democrats . 
though Dole tried to seize the issue , it was Perot who succeeded in landing the most telling blows against the president in a series of feisty speeches . 
&quot; Today we have special prosecutors investigating our president , his wife and his business associates involved in these same matters and we are headed directly toward a second Watergate in 1997 , &quot; he said in one speech this week . 
Florida pollster Robert Joffee , of the Mason-Dixon organisation , said Republicans were finally coming back to Dole . 
Perot &apos;s support had also jumped four points in the last two weeks and Clinton &apos;s lead was wafer thin in Florida . 
&quot; Republicans have a history of moving into the Dole column at the last moment , &quot; said Joffee . 
asked who would win Florida , he said , &quot; Clinton , but I wouldn &apos;t bet the farm on it .
