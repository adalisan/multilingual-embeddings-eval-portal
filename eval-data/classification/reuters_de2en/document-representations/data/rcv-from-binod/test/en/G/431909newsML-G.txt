China and South Korea will discuss this week terms for the departure from Beijing of North Korea &apos;s top ideologue holed up in South Korea &apos;s mission , Seoul foreign ministry officials said on Monday . 
they said they hoped for a breakthrough to end a diplomatic standoff over Hwang Jang-yop , who arrived at Seoul &apos;s consular compound in Beijing on February 12 to seek asylum . 
&quot; I don &apos;t expect Hwang to leave Beijing this week but details of his departure will be discussed this week and could be worked out , &quot; said one ministry official , who declined to be identified . 
Ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung said he believed Beijing had ruled out sending Hwang Jang-yop back to North Korea . 
&quot; I understand both sides have formed a common stand that a solution must be found as soon as possible , &quot; Lee told Reuters . 
&quot; I believe China has ruled out sending him back to North Korea . 
he said South Korea still wanted to send Hwang directly to Seoul but would not rule out bringing him via a third country . 
Hwang , ranked 24th in Pyongyang &apos;s hierarchy , is the chief architect of Pyongyang &apos;s ruling ideology of Juche , or self-reliance , and is the highest North Korean official to flee the communist country . 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said on Friday that China was still investigating Hwang &apos;s case and appealed to North and South Korea to stay calm . 
&quot; We hope all sides can take a cool-headed attitude so as to solve this problem as soon as possible , &quot; Qian said , but gave no details of the issues blocking a resolution . 
Qian said Hwang &apos;s case was essentially a matter between the two Koreas , but since it had taken place in Beijing it came under Chinese jurisdiction . 
he said China would follow international law and common international practice to solve the issue , while taking into account the need to promote peace on the Korean peninsula . 
North and South Korea have been locked in Cold War confrontation since their 1950-53 conflict .
