Florida &apos;s Dade County will hold a non-binding referendum Nov 5 on a revenue sharing plan aimed at subsidizing basic services to poor municipalities . 
the plan would allow the county to take control of up to three mills , or 30 percent , of the property taxes levied by each city . 
the revenues would go into a trust fund and be redistributed according to each city &apos;s population . 
wealthier cities with high property values , such as Miami Beach and coral Gables , would get back less than they put in . 
poorer cities struggling to provide basic services , such as Miami and Hialeah , would get back more . 
&quot; It gives each community a fighting chance to have quality local government , &quot; said Eugene Stearns , the attorney who drafted the proposal . 
while the exact formula has not been used elsewhere , Minneapolis-St Paul successfully uses a similar program to redistribute property tax revenues from commercial properties , Stearns said . 
the Dade County commission put the proposal on the ballot at the request of Commissioner Betty Ferguson , whose district includes some of the county &apos;s poorest neighborhoods . 
&quot; It probably is not going to be successful , &quot; Stearns acknowledged . 
&quot; This is all part of an education process . 
one of the things this vote on Tuesday does is at least put it out in front of everybody . 
in recent years , the middle class has largely left Miami &apos;s inner city , while affluent neighborhoods such as Aventura and Key Biscayne , have split off from the county and incorporated as independent cities . 
increasingly , the poorer neighborhoods -- especially the City of Miami -- are struggling to provide basic police and garbage services and road repairs . 
Ferguson said the situation would only worsen if the state succeeds with a program to halt urban sprawl and force new residents into the &quot; urban infields . 
&quot; They &apos;re focusing on areas that already have inadequate services and infrastructure . 
if we don &apos;t get serious and come up with a plan ... we &apos;re heading down a dangerous path , &quot; she said . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see an alternative to some form of revenue sharing . 
Ferguson hopes to eventually put some variation of the proposal on the ballot for real . 
such a plan would require an amendment to the county charter . 
Stearns and Ferguson expect the plan to be a tough sell in wealthier neighborhoods , but said they too would benefit . 
&quot; Unless they &apos;re planning to cage themselves up somewhere , they should be concerned with the quality of life overall , &quot; Ferguson said .
