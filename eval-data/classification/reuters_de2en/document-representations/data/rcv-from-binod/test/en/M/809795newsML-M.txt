Belgian OLOs were comfortably higher in line with Bunds on Tuesday but uncertainty prevailed among players taking conflicting positions on the yield curve . 
&quot; There is a lot of uncertainty , but little volume , &quot; one Luxembourg-based trader said . 
at 1440 GMT , the benchmark 2007 OLO was yielding 5.69 percent against 5.73 on Monday as both Belgian and German markets were buoyed by good M3 money supply data in the morning . 
the data helped convince markets the Bundesbank would not raise key interest rates when its council meets on Thursday for the first time after a four-week summer break . 
&quot; Some are playing flattening ( of the curve ) by buying the long end and selling short paper . 
others are banking on a steepening , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; The curve is clearly looking for a trend , &quot; he said . 
he added the curve was back in the position it held at the end of July and that it was most likely to flatten marginally in the next few sessions . 
&quot; But also the exact opposite , &quot; one trader said . 
trading in OLO 11 , maturing in 1998 , continued to be busy after the exchange auction where a total 14.88 billion of new OLOs were sold . 
OLOs 25 , 6 ( 2003 ) and 9 ( 2007 ) were largely ignored at the auction . 
today &apos;s meeting of the U.S. policy making Federal Open Market Committee was mainly dismissed as a non-event by the OLO market , traders said .
