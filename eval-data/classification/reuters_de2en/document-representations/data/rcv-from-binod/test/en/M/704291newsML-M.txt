UK gilts recovered well from the lows made in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the budget , but they were still 10 / 32 down on the official pit settlement price . 
overseas buyers came to the market &apos;s aid , lured in by the pound &apos;s renewed strength on hopes of higher interest rates . 
&quot; There has certainly been foreign buying of fixed income stocks on the back of the strength of sterling , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; There was some buying overnight and more today . 
with sterling still at these levels the foreigners seem to be very content to buy . 
the September gilt future ended the day down at 114-15 compared to the previous close of 114-25 . 
nevertheless they did recover some 17 / 32 on the opening price , dictated by the after-hours sell off following Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown &apos;s budget speech . 
many analysts said Brown did not go far enough in his budget to rein in consumer demand , and that the only thing left to control the economy is monetary policy . 
&quot; The only weapon left is interest rates to control the economy , and if they go up , sterling will go up in anticipation of it , &quot; the trader said . 
Brown handed the over the power to set interest rates to the Bank of England in one of his first policy measures , leaving him to set the inflation targets . 
the Bank of England monetary policy committee meets to discuss rates next week with its decision coming on July 10 .
