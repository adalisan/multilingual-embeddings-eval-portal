Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli defence chief Yitzhak Mordechai met late on Sunday to iron out details of an evasive deal to give Palestinians self-rule in Hebron , witnesses said . 
&quot; tonight &apos;s meeting will concentrate on the substance of certain security issues . 
President Arafat and Minister Mordechai will be discussing and trying to bridge the gap , &quot; chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters beforehand . 
the Israeli defence minister and the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) chief shook hands at the start of their meeting hours after the Palestinian president returned from Cairo where he briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . 
Israeli and PLO officials have said they expect Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sign an agreement giving the Palestinians control of 80 percent of Hebron by Tuesday , the end of the year . 
but on Sunday Netanyahu told Israeli army radio he could not say with certainty a deal was imminent . 
Hebron is the last of seven occupied West Bank towns Israel agreed to give self-rule under an agreement signed with the PLO in 1995 . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton &apos;s Middle East envoy Dennis Ross was due back in the region on Monday to mediate any last-minute snags and attend the signing . 
security concerns have held up the handover in Hebron , including demands by Netanyahu for additional measures he says are needed to protect the 400 Jewish settlers in the heart of the town of 100,000 Arabs . 
underscoring the tensions in the town , military sources said petrol bombs were thrown at Israeli army targets but no one was hurt and no damage was done . 
the right-wing Netanyahu , elected in May on a promise to guard Israeli security , reminded the world a deal on Israeli redeployment in Hebron did not mean Jews would leave the town . 
&quot; Anyone who tells you we are leaving Hebron is telling you a lie . 
we &apos;re there and we &apos;re there forever . 
the Jewish people are not leaving Hebron , &quot; he told U.S. students on Sunday . 
in Cairo , foreign ministers from eight Arab countries asked the United States , as a broker of Middle East peace , to put financial pressure on Israel to stop settling Jews in occupied Arab lands . 
some 130,000 Jews live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in settlements scattered among two million Palestinians . 
the ministers warned Israel it should not expect cooperation from other Middle East states until it withdraws from all occupied lands and allows the Palestinians to &quot; attain their legitimate rights &quot; -- listed in their statement as establishing a Palestinian state that includes Arab East Jerusalem . 
the eight countries are Egypt , Syria and the six Gulf Arab states Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . 
they are known as the Damascus Declaration states for the agreement they signed after the Gulf War in 1991 and meet every six months to keep the alliance alive .
