Iranian security forces killed three &quot; foreign agents &quot; trying to infiltrate into western Iran to carry out acts of sabotage , a newspaper said on Wednesday . 
the daily Kayhan quoted the top security official in Kurdistan province , which borders on Iraq , as saying the three were on a mission to bomb unspecified economic targets in the province and in other parts of the country . 
it did not say when they were killed . 
the three had been involved in several bombings in the 1980s and one had spied for Baghdad during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war , the unnamed official said . 
it was not clear if the slayings were related to recent Iranian reports of clashes between security forces and members of the Iraq-based Mujahideen Khalq armed opposition . 
Tehran has blamed the group , which has several camps in Iraq near the Iranian border , for cross-border attacks and bombings in the past .
