French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen declared war on Sunday on a mass anti-racism campaign that has targeted him and his National Front party a year ahead of general elections . 
&quot; We can no longer tolerate France , one of the least racist nations in the world , being called racist , fascist and Nazi , &quot; Le Pen said in a fiery speech closing a three-day party congress in the eastern city of Strasbourg . 
he said just nine of 4.4 million crimes in France last year were racially linked and added : &quot; The figure would be much higher if one counted racist crimes against French people &quot; . 
the party congress was overshadowed by a mass protest march on Saturday which drew an estimated 40,000 people into the streets of Strasbourg . 
it ended as the European Union proclaimed a Year against Racism at the Strasbourg headquarters of the European parliament and the Council of Europe which promotes democracy and human rights . 
Le Pen said the anti-racism campaign was &quot; intended to mask the impotence &quot; of the other parties . 
he denounced the protests against him and his party as thuggery organised by the Left . 
&quot; anti-racism is no longer an opinion , but a way of life that is growing wealthy at the expense of our wallets , &quot; he said . 
earlier in the day , the 2,200 party delegate at the congress adopted a platform and a battle plan for winning a foothold in the French parliament , where it now has no seats . 
Le Pen predicted that the Front will win at least &quot; 10 or 20 seats &quot; despite the first-past-the-post election system . 
the political establishment condemns the Front as a racist and xenophobic party . 
surveys to date have suggested it would not win a single seat in the March 1998 poll . 
Le Pen , whose rise has pressured the centre-right government into beefing up already tight immigration laws , has been basking in the spotlight after winning a fourth city hall last month . 
but organisers of the protest march , who celebrated the end of the congress and the departure of Front delegates with a picnic on a city square , insisted it marked a turning point in the Front &apos;s fortunes . 
front leaders worked hard to put a mainstream gloss on their convention . 
but the congress took place in a virtual fortress as police and the Front &apos;s own security service erected concentric barriers to keep out protesters and prevent clashes . 
security guards cautioned delegates whenever they left the convention centre to remove their National Front badges so as to avoid drawing attention to their affiliation with the party . 
police said four members of the Front &apos;s security service , overzealous in implementing their leader &apos;s calls for law and order , were detained for posing as policemen and clashing with protesters . 
France-Inter radio said they had been making identity checks and arrests . 
Le Pen , who denies charges that he is anti-semitic or racist , compared his supporters to &quot; a caste of less-than-citizens , pariahs who remind us of plague victims during the Middle Ages or the Jews of Nazi Germany . 
he delivered his third and final speech of the congress in front of an image of a gagged Marianne , the symbol of France . 
strutting onto the stage waving both fists in the air , he ended 90 minutes later with a cry of &quot; Long live France , Long live the National Front &quot; as dozens of supporters waved flags . 
the party &apos;s new platform would ban abortion , abolish income tax , give salaries to mothers without paying jobs and repeal a law which bans incitement of racial , ethnic or religious hatred . 
virtually identical to the 1993 platform , it would restore the death penalty , pull France out of European monetary union , send home three million immigrants and institute preference in jobs and social benefits for &quot; native-born &quot; French people . 
Party leaders openly acknowledged it would take the Front seven years to fulfil a pledge to fly home three million immigrants , at the rate of six planes a day . 
some 2,000 police were on duty to keep order during the march , and some protesters threw bottles and fired flare guns at police after the march had ended , prompting police to respond with teargas and a water cannon . 
&quot; This is why we must restore law and order in France ... It is time that the good people reassert themselves and the evil ones tremble , &quot; Le Pen said .
