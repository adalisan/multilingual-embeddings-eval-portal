champions Borussia Dortmund bungled their chance to go top of the German first division on Friday , crashing 2-0 at 16th-placed Fortuna Duesseldorf . 
Duesseldorf , famed more for a stonewall defence than for an attack which had scored 14 goals in 18 games , took the lead against the run of play 40 seconds after halftime when Russian striker Sergei Yuran drilled home a pass from Macchambes Younga 10 metres out . 
with a shocked Dortmund throwing everything forward , Igor Dobrovolski took advantage of the space they left at the back to score Duesseldorf &apos;s second on the break in the 58th minute . 
the result left Dortmund in second place , two points behind Bayern Munich , who have the chance to extend their lead when they travel to seventh-placed Bochum on Saturday . 
in the night &apos;s other matches , Hamburg trounced bottom club Freiburg 4-0 away , and St Pauli lost 3-2 at home to Arminia Bielefeld .
