major Asian stock markets such as Hong Kong , Tokyo and Sydney could catch a case of the jitters from a struggling Wall Street this week , but traders said smaller bourses will likely remain immune . 
&quot; Indonesia is looking good , &quot; said a regional trader . 
&quot; Malaysia looks as though it &apos;s got a bit more fire there as well .

the U.S. index sank 59 points to 6696.48 on Friday , its third straight fall , and is seen consolidating at current levels .

it was the market &apos;s worst weekly decline in 10 months . 
stocks are expected to fall further this week , brokers said . 
&quot; Investors have seen the market come down for a week and they are staying on the sidelines . 
I expect there still to be some selling pressure but there should be some support at 13,000 points , &quot; said Peter So of Schroder Securities . 
Tokyo - Tokyo stocks are expected to be volatile , driven by futures-linked trade , and racked by persistent uncertainty over the economy and the health of the financial sector . 
the benchmark Nikkei average rebounded sharply on January 22 but was unable to hold above the 18,000 threshold for long .

on Sunday a top Finance Ministry official sought to reassure investors . 
Eisuke Sakakibara , international finance bureau director , said the economy was in better shape than people thought and urged Japanese to stop selling out their own market .

the All Ordinaries index closed at 2,423 , down 12.5 points over the week despite reaching a record high of 2,456.7 and record close of 2,444.2 on January 20 . 
profit-taking cropped the benchmark from its highs early in the week while Friday &apos;s trade ahead of a local holiday weekend was predictably dominated by sellers cutting positions . 
Taipei - Share prices are expected to consolidate at around current levels week due to a lack of new bullish factors . 
profit-taking pressure which emerged late last week should continue to plague the market , although no major falls are seen with support coming from pre-holiday buying ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year on February 7 , brokers said . 
the market , spurred by Taiwan &apos;s ongoing economic recovery , has risen nearly 400 points in January .
