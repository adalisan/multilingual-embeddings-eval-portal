President Jacques Chirac said on Monday he wanted all French secondary schools to be connected to the Internet by the year 2000 to promote computer skills and job prospects linked to information technology . 
in a live television programme on youth employment , Chirac said that contrary to widespread belief , France was not behind in computers but needed to take the next leap forward . 
&quot; I want by the year 2000 , that is to say in three years &apos; time , all secondary schools to be connected to information networks , and that will happen , &quot; Chirac said . 
he cited President Clinton &apos;s plan to computerise U.S. schools and fight illiteracy , saying his own aim was to eradicate illiteracy in French children entering high-school by the end of his seven-year term in 2002 . 
Chirac also said he had asked the government to cut value added tax on multimedia products and services , including CD-ROMs , to the lowest rate of 5.6 percent from 20.6 percent . 
in contrast to a widely criticised television interview he gave in December , he sought to project optimism about France &apos;s dynamism , denouncing what he called &quot; a sort of permanent masochism we have that stresses the negative and gives the impression there &apos;s no way forward &quot; .
