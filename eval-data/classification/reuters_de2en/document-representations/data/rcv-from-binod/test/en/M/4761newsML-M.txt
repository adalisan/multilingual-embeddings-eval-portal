the Indian Oil Corp. ( IOC ) has tendered to buy one million barrels of crude oil for October , traders said on Tuesday . 
the tender closes August 29 and offers should be valid until August 30 , they said . 
the tender covers a range of crude oil , including MidEast , Asian regional grades , North Sea and West African . 
for September , IOC bought three very large crude carriers ( VLCC ) of Nigerian qua Iboe crude and five cargoes of Dubai crude . 
traders said West African crude might be difficult to work into the Indian tender for October given the widening spread of Brent / Dubai . 
Brent rallied in London on Monday with October gaining 30 cents to $ 20.85 . 
the October Brent / Dubai was notionally talked in Asia on Tuesday at $ 1.90 / $ 2.00 per barrel , out from $ 1.70 / $ 1.90 on Monday .
