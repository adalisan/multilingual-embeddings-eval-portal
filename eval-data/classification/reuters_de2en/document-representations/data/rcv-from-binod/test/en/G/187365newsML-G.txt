South Korea broke ground on Wednesday for a new &quot; Freedom House &quot; , a symbol of the division of the Korean peninsula on the southern side of the border village of Panmunjom . 
unification Minister Kwon O-kie presided over the ground-breaking ceremony in front of the existing Freedom House -- a three-tier pagoda that has no practical function . 
a new four storey structure housing offices and a press centre will cost 10 billion won ( $ 12 million ) and be completed in March 1998 , a unification ministry statement said . 
when the plan was announced in January , the government said the building would handle growing economic ties , diplomatic shuttling and engineers visiting the North to build nuclear power plants . 
since then , however , North-South relations have soured following a series of border security scares and the intrusion in September of a North Korean submarine . 
economic exchanges have been put on ice , the United States has yet to open a planned diplomatic liaison office in Pyongyang and implementation of an accord to build two light-water nuclear reactors has been delayed . 
&quot; The construction is an expression of our government &apos;s will to consolidate the basis for peaceful Korean unification through dialogue , &quot; Kwon said at the ceremony . 
the existing Freedom House , built in 1965 , will remain . 
a truce accord signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War sealed the World War Two division of Korea into the communist north and capitalist south .
