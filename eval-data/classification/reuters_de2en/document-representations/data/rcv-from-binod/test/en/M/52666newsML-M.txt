share prices on the Caracas Stock Exchange surged to new record highs Friday as investors were encouraged by continued firm oil prices and a recent drop in interest rates both at home and abroad , brokers said . 
according to preliminary figures from the exchange , the market &apos;s 19-share index rose 2.47 percent to 4,779.34 . 
brokers said the high level of Venezuela &apos;s oil export prices had encouraged investors on the economy &apos;s medium-term prospects . 
&quot; They perceive that the country &apos;s macro-economic situation could stabilize after the increase in oil revenues , &quot; said Gonzalo Alonso of the Activalores brokerage . 
brokers also noted the boost given by a recent drop in interest rates both in Venezuela and in the United States . 
trading volumes , however , remained moderate with 2.069 billion bolivars ( $ 4.4 million ) changing hands . 
stocks rose virtually across the board with 29 closing higher , three lower and five unchanged . 
among leading stocks , benchmark Electricidad de Caracas rose 11.00 bolivars to 412.00 bolivars , steel company Sivensa rose 9.00 bolivars to 303.00 bolivars and agro- industrial company Mavesa edged up 1.25 Bolivar to 125.00 bolivars . 
brokers said they expected prices to hit new records in growing volumes next week as local and foreign investor confidence grows .
