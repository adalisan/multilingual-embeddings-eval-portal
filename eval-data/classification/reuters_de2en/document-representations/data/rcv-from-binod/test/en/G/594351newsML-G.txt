Liberia &apos;s general election , originally scheduled for May 30 , are likely to be held in July , a delegate to a meeting of Liberians in Nigeria said on Monday . 
&quot; It is likely that the elections will be in July , &quot; said Reginald Goodridge , spokesman for former warlord Charles Taylor , who launched the Liberia civil war in 1989 and is a leading presidential candidate . 
&quot; Based on proposals put forward by the independent electoral commission the elections should be held no further than in the early part of July , &quot; he told Reuters from Abuja . 
some 100 Liberian leaders , including former warlords , tribal chiefs , politicians and representatives of the electoral commission , have been holding election talks in Abuja since last week . 
they also met Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha on Friday to decide when to hold the elections . 
&quot; The date and modalities for holding the elections have been agreed upon . 
basically 98-99 percent of the issues have been agreed upon , &quot; Goodridge added . 
the legislative and presidential votes are crucial to consolidating the end of Liberia &apos;s civil war which broke out in 1989 when Taylor &apos;s forces invaded the country from Ivory Coast . 
the May date was part of a peace plan brokered in Abuja last August by the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , of which Abacha is chairman , and backed by the Nigerian-led African peacekeeping force ECOMOG . 
most of the Liberian leaders have called for a postponement until August or September for security reasons , logistics and lack of voter education . 
Taylor &apos;s faction has argued that any postponement should not go beyond June because Liberia needs a president as soon as possible to lead the nation . 
delegates said key issues agreed upon were that votes will be counted on site instead of at a central point . 
the tenure of the elected president would be six years as originally agreed in the Liberia peace deal , they added . 
they said the Abuja talks were still discussing whether there should be separate ballots for the presidential and legislative elections or whether they should be held at the same time . 
the final decisions would be taken by heads of state of the ECOWAS committee of nine on Liberia on Wednesday , they said . 
Abacha told the Liberians last week that there was a limit to how much sacrifice West African nations could make to maintain peace in Liberia . 
freed American slaves founded Liberia , Africa &apos;s first republic in 1847 . 
the war has killed more than 150,000 people and displaced half the pre-war population of 2.5 million . 
hundreds of thousands of Liberians are refugees in neighbouring Ivory Coast , Guinea and Sierra Leone . 
others are in Ghana and Nigeria .
