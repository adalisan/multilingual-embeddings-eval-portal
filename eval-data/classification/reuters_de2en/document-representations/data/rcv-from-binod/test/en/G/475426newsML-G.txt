foes of the French extreme right virtually took over the city of Strasbourg on Saturday in a massive display of anger over the rise of the National Front and its feisty leader Jean-Marie Le Pen . 
youths masquerading as corpses mourning &quot; the death of democracy &quot; marched alongside rock bands and the children of Jews deported to Nazi death camps in a sobering yet exuberant march as the Front opened a three-day congress in the city . 
police said the crowd reached 34,000 while the Strasbourg city hall estimated that 50,000 took part . 
all agreed the turnout was one of the largest in the city since Strasbourg &apos;s citizens celebrated the end of World War Two . 
marchers followed a twisting eight-km ( five-mile ) route that encircled and then criss-crossed the entire city , which is home to the European parliament and the Council of Europe , set up after the war to champion democracy and human rights . 
demonstrators were still lining up to leave the Place de l &apos;Etoile , where the protest began , when those who led the march arrived at its end point at the Saint-Pierre Le jeune church . 
to prevent clashes between protesters and the 2,200 delegates to the Front meeting , squads of riot police sealed off all accesses to the city &apos;s convention centre where it was held . 
at the end of the march , a few dozen youths hurled stones at police who stopped them marching to the conference hall . 
police responded with tear gas . 
witnesses said three policemen were injured and seven people arrested . 
the Front &apos;s own security forces supplemented police with multiple rings of physical barriers and badge checks to prevent unauthorised outsiders from getting in . 
&quot; Don &apos;t wear your conference badge into the city centre . 
it &apos;s dangerous , &quot; a National Front security guard warned delegates as they left the building at the end of the day . 
the protest attracted marchers from Switzerland , Begium , Italy , Spain and Germany as well as France . 
while most were young , others displayed their age like a badge of courage , such as those marching under a banner reading : &quot; sons and daughters of deported French Jews . 
one man wore a bright yellow Jewish star on his chest and carried a sign reading simply : &quot; Never again , &quot; 
some were on stilts . 
many dressed as corpses or as if in mourning , in keeping with organisers &apos; belief that the Front &apos;s growing popularity in France signals &quot; the death of democracy . 
one young woman portrayed a concentration camp victim of the future , screaming sadly at the top of her lungs for what must have been hours . 
others took a decidedly lighter approach , dancing to Caribbean rhythms , rap or rock and roll supplied by bands playing from flatbed trucks . 
rap bands , whose members are often of North African origin , were particularly in evidence as the Front denounces them as decadent symbols of France &apos;s immigrant population , which it blames for high unemployment and urban crime . 
marchers also blew whistles and beat on drums in time to their anti-Front slogans . 
Le Pen dismissed the protest , saying that more Strasbourg residents voted for him in 1995 presidential elections than demonstrated against him . 
he won 26 percent of the vote in Strasbourg and a national score of 15 percent .
