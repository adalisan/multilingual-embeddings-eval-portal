Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said on Saturday he doubted whether the European Union would hold a special jobs summit in October as mulled in Amsterdam earlier this week . 
Dehaene said in an interview with daily newspaper Le Soir that the final text on the Amsterdam summit of EU leaders on Monday and Tuesday did not mention the special jobs meeting . 
&quot; I said right from the start that it was a false good idea to convene a special jobs summmit , &quot; Dehaene said , arguing that it was likely to raise expectations that would be hard to fulfil . 
instead , he thought unemployment could be discussed at the next scheduled summit of EU heads of government in December under Luxembourg &apos;s presidency of the Union . 
&quot; Luxembourg &apos;s Premier Jean-Claude Juncker has already said that if he saw no real value added in such a meeting he would not organise it , &quot; Dehaene . 
the EU came under strong pressure from the new Socialist French government to coordinate economic policies to help reduce the number of unemployed , numbering about 18 million , in the 15-nation bloc . 
Paris only agreed to a budget stability pact for the European single currency after the other EU partners made commitments on closer cooperation on growth and employment . 
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said on Monday in Amsterdam that there was an agreement to hold the special jobs meeting and that the date under discussion was October 17 . 
the text of the conclusions on the Amsterdam summit was only available at the end of this week .
