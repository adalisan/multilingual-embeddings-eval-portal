the German central bank said its policy-making council held key interest rates steady at its meeting on Thursday . 
the Bundesbank &apos;s discount rate remains at 2.50 percent and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 4.50 percent . 
the central bank &apos;s main money market rate , the repo , was also maintained at three percent for the next two weeks . 
a Reuter survey of economists this week showed that none of the 10 polled expected any change in the central bank &apos;s credit policies and the German bond and share markets showed almost no response to the news .
