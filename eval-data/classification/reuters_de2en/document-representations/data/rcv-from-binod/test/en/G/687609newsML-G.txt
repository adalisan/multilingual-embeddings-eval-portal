Britain will make a last-ditch appeal to European allies to show solidarity on Hong Kong and keep up pressure on China as it prepares to take control of the British colony , the Guardian reported on Wednesday . 
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook would make the appeal at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Thursday , said the newspaper , which gave no source for its front-page report . 
&quot; The ( British ) government fears its European partners are putting trade considerations before human rights issues , &quot; the Guardian said . 
&quot; British hopes of maintaining pressure on China , which will close Hong Kong &apos;s legislature and install an unelected governing body , will rest on a boycott of the Chinese ceremony by Denmark and Sweden . 
&quot; The Foreign Office is glumly resigned to attendance by senior representatives from France and Germany . 
&quot; Even the Netherlands , normally strong on human rights , is to attend because of its current position as president of the EU , while Canada , Australia and Japan are sending their foreign ministers . 
Beijing will take over Hong Kong on Tuesday after more than 150 years of British rule . 
China received a double booster on Wednesday after the United States renewed its trade privileges and decided to send a representative to attend the swearing in of the new legislature . 
the spectre of superpower trade isolation was banished for another year when the U.S. House of Representatives voted by a hefty margin to renew China &apos;s Most Favoured Nation ( MFN ) status . 
&quot; The right way to encourage further progress in China is not to cut China off but to draw China in , &quot; said President Bill Clinton . 
Hong Kong would have been seriously injured if China had lost its MFN status . 
the territory , the world &apos;s seventh biggest trading economy , stood to lose up to $ 30 billion a year in related revenues . 
MFN critics had said the benefits should be denied because of fears that China would erode Hong Kong &apos;s liberties and because of Beijing &apos;s human rights record , trade imbalance with the United States and tensions with Taiwan . 
White House security adviser Samuel Berger argued that isolationism was counter-productive . 
&quot; We cannot ignore a quarter of the world &apos;s people , &quot; he said . 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is flying to Hong Kong for the handover but boycotting the swearing in of Beijing &apos;s handpicked provisional legislature which takes control of the new Chinese region under a &quot; one country , two systems &quot; formula . 
the United States said however it would still be represented at the ceremony by its consul general .
