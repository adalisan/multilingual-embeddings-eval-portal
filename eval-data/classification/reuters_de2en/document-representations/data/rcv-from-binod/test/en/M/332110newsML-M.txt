German call money rates eased to around 3.05 percent on Friday after the Bundesbank injected additional funds to offset a liquidity squeeze which resulted as dealers scrambled to meet a higher reserve requirement . 
rates traded between 3.00 / 15 percent today after hitting 3.20 percent on Thursday as the market reacted to a higher than expected 40 billion mark January reserve requirement . 
the central bank this morning set a quick tender and awarded 3.2 billion marks of funds which will remain in the market for five days . 
dealers said the step was expected and largely responsible for helping rates come off again . 
Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said the move was designed to bring money market rates back to the recent average rates of around three percent . 
he also said the move signaled German interest rates would remain steady in the near-term . 
the Bundesbank has kept its main money market , the repo , fixed at three percent since late August and today &apos;s funds were again awarded at that rate . 
banks held 42.4 billion marks in non-interest bearing accounts at the Bundesbank on Thursday , up from Wednesday &apos;s 41.9 billion marks held . 
the monthly average rose to 40.3 billion marks from 40.2 billion marks . 
banks borrowed 100 million marks at the Lombard facility . 
the Frankfurt Interbank overnight average was set at 3.12800 percent on Friday after 3.15683 percent .
