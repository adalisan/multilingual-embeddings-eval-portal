U.S. crudes returned to positive territory Thursday afternoon , continuing a choppy trading session punctuated by rallying off Iraq-U.S. tensions , and profit-taking once the news is digested . 
traders said U.S. military strikes were anticipated , but underlying pressure on crude was generated by technical factors in the futures markets . 
cash brokers said domestic grades saw price levels stabilize after weakening Wednesday and early Thursday . 
October West Texas Intermediate / Cushing was back at $ 24.90- $ 25.00 a barrel , 20-25 cts above Wednesday &apos;s close . 
declines in Light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James were far less pronounced than traders expected , with the grade talked well into the afternoon at a 32-35 cts premium to WTI / Cushing . 
James trade . 
overall , refiners are weary of bringing North Sea cargoes into the U.S. Gulf , as the economics of running the crude does not make sense at the moment , traders said .
