the Brussels bourse edged higher in early trading on Wednesday , lagging its European neighbours , but traders said they saw no reason for a reversal with the market happy at current levels . 
&quot; There are no specific reasons for it to rise or to fall from here . 
the dollar is up a bit and Wall Street &apos;s overnight drop was just light profittaking , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Yesterday we were fairly neutral , although there was some quite significant buying in specific shares such as PetroFina which really helped to underpin the whole market , &quot; the trader added . 
traders said the market was watching for U.S. April producer price index figures due at 1230 GMT . 
the figures are seen unchanged month-on-month and up 1.5 percent year-on-year . 
they said that while a number of company annual meetings were due to take place during Wednesday , there were no expectations of anything specific . 
insurer Dexia , fast food retailer Quick and non-ferrous metals group Union Miniere are among the companies holding either annual or extraordinary general meetings today . 
quick was an early victim , dropping more than six percent at one stage after the company said in a newspaper interview the first four months of 1997 had been flat . 
by 0900 GMT it had crept back to 1,940 francs -- a loss of 4.9 percent . 
on the plus side Distrigas was an early star , rising 5.4 percent to 29,500 francs in reaction to positive comments at the firm &apos;s annual meeting on Tuesday . 
builder Franki likewise added strongly to its recent jet propelled performance , climbing 4.0 percent to 520 francs . 
traders said the rise was due to fading worries among shareholders over the loss making company &apos;s fate . 
but they noted that the volume was low and the share movements therefore exaggerated . 
at 0920 GMT the Bel-20 blue chip share index was 0.25 percent up at 2,248.58 , with some 750 million francs of Belgian shares traded .
