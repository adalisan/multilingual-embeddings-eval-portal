Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said on Tuesday he had no alternative to pursuing peace talks with Israel and still saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a partner despite Israel &apos;s decision to build new Jewish housing in East Jerusalem . 
at a Washington news conference , Arafat again bitterly denounced the Israeli decision to build 6,500 new homes in mainly Arab East Jerusalem , calling it an illegal move that created a &quot; real challenge &quot; to the peace process . 
he charged that the aim of the housing project on a hill between Jerusalem and Bethlehem was to separate the two places and &quot; replace &quot; Bethlehem in celebrations of the 2,000th anniversary of Jesus Christ &apos;s birth there . 
nevertheless , Arafat said : &quot; It is our duty and our job and our target to carry on with the peace process . 
we have no other alternative . 
and in spite of all the difficulties we are facing , we have one alternative : to carry on with the peace process . 
this is our strategic target . 
Arafat was speaking during a U.S. visit in which he received support from President Bill Clinton on Monday on the issue of the housing to be built on a hill known to Jews as Har Homa and to Arabs as Jebel Abu Ghneim . 
a U.N. Security Council debate scheduled to begin on Tuesday on Israel &apos;s decision to build the new neighbourhood was postponed until Wednesday at the request of the United States . 
Israel seized East Jerusalem along with other Arab territory in the 1967 Middle East War and has since declared the whole city its eternal and undivided capital . 
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state . 
&quot; What has been declared recently by the Israeli government has made very difficult circumstances for the peace process , &quot; said Arafat , who waived aside an interpreter and spoke in halting English . 
&quot; It is a real challenge for the peace process . 
no one can imagine the damage for the peace process for that ( housing ) decision ... 
it will isolate Jerusalem more and more and more and more and ... separate between Jerusalem and Bethlehem . 
the Palestinian leader said the move violated commitments by Israel &apos;s former Labour government not to alter the demographic balance in the area until the peace process was complete . 
Arafat was rounding out a two-day visit to the United States , which has led efforts to mediate Middle East peace . 
he called his talks with Clinton &quot; very constructive , positive , warm , &quot; and noted that the president had also criticised the East Jerusalem housing decision . 
&quot; I haven &apos;t the right to say what he is going to do , but I &apos;m sure he will push forward with all his capability to save the peace process , &quot; Arafat said . 
despite his criticisms , Arafat said he considered Netanyahu , Israel &apos;s right-wing Likud prime minister , his peace &quot; partner &quot; just as previous Labour premiers were . 
asked whether he viewed Netanyahu as a partner , a term he often uses to describe the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , or an &quot; opponent , &quot; Arafat replied : &quot; My partner . 
&quot; I have to respect what the Israelis have elected ... We are making the peace with the Israeli people . 
he is now my partner , as Rabin was my partner , as Shimon Peres was my partner , now my partner is Mr Netanyahu , &quot; he said . 
Arafat &apos;s visit , one of a series by Middle Eastern leaders to Washington , has won him an upgrade in U.S.-Palestinian ties with the creation of a joint commission like those the United States already has with Russia , South Africa and Egypt . 
the commission , to be headed by Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , will oversee relations with an emphasis on the channelling of U.S. economic aid to the Palestinian self-rule authority .
