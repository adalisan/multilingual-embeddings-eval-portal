thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees emerged from the forest in eastern Zaire on Saturday , entering a rebel-held camp near Goma before heading back for the border and home , witnesses said . 
a Reuters correspondent said an estimated 2,100 had made their way to Mugunga camp , where they were being processed by aid workers . 
&quot; We hid in the forest for three weeks and have had a seven-day walk from the forest , during which we were being attacked by the Mai Mai , &quot; said Nathan Mdutiye , who said he would be returning to Rwanda . 
the Mai Mai is a local Zairean militia drawn from indigenous tribes hostile to all ethnic Rwandans , Hutus or Tutsi . 
the name means water -- the Mai Mai believe bullets fired at them turn to water . 
another group of refugees comprising two women and six children , one with Downs Syndrome , said they had lost their brothers and husbands in an attack by men armed with bows and arrows and sticks . 
Medecins sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) staff treated some of the injured at the side of the road . 
they included a two-year-old child with legs bearing machete wounds , a five-year-old who had been shot , and an adolescent boy with an arrow wound to the shoulder and club wound to the head . 
&quot; They are coming in these large groups for security but the really bad ones are still out there in the forest , &quot; said an official of the International Red Cross ( ICRC ) . 
other refugees said there were &quot; many , many &quot; refugees still in the forest but they could give no clear idea of numbers . 
these refugees are following in the wake of about 500,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire who walked back into Rwanda last week . 
the new group had fled into the forest in October to avoid fighting around the refugee camps , pitting mainly Tutsi rebels against the Zairean army and Rwandan Hutu extremists , including the Interahamwe militia . 
residents in sake , just west of Goma , reported renewed heavy fighting in and around the town overnight , and said there were now rebel roadblocks on the roads into the town . 
&quot; There was very heavy firing last night , &quot; Denis Nduziye , from a hamlet outside sake , said . 
&quot; The rebels told us it was the Interahamwe who had come down from the Masisi . 
the half million refugees decided to return home when the Hutu militiamen and troops of the former Rwandan army were forced to flee the camps . 
however , aid workers said that left up to 700,000 more refugees unaccounted for in eastern Zaire . 
in Goma itself , doctors reported a cholera epidemic , with 15 deaths in the past week . 
&quot; We have had 114 confirmed cases of cholera since the refugees left a week ago , &quot; said Jo Lusi , a doctor at the Virunga hospital in the slums of northern Goma . 
&quot; For us an epidemic would be 40 , but this is nearly three times that .
