a powerful cyclone that loomed large off India &apos;s southeast coast turned away , but meteorologists said on Thursday it might return with renewed ferocity . 
meteorologists said the cyclone , which has threatened Andhra Pradesh state in the past two days , was 200 km ( 125 miles ) southeast of Machilipatnam port . 
&quot; For the last three hours , it has been stationary , which I fear is a sign of gathering intensity , &quot; said J.V.M. 
Naidu , head of the cyclone warning centre at Visakhapatnam port . 
officials in the state capital Hyderabad said around 335,000 people had been evacuated from 780 villages along a coastal stretch 90 km ( 56 miles ) long and 10 km ( six miles ) wide ahead of the storm . 
&quot; As the behaviour of the cyclone has been erratic so far , we are on full alert as it may still swing around and hit the coast , &quot; said a spokesman for the state government . 
the storm weakened in the morning with its wind speed falling to 90-120 kph ( 56-75 miles per hour ) from 150-180 kph ( 94-113 mph ) earlier , according to meteorologists . 
&quot; Even at a reduced speed , it still retains tremendous destructive potential , &quot; Naidu said . 
&quot; winds of 100 kph ( 63 miles per hour ) are more than enough to knock down cables , trees and thatched houses . 
he said the storm , which was earlier expected to cross land on Thursday evening , could hit the coast on Friday morning if it changed course . 
in Kakinada , headquarters of East Godavari district where six people have died in the past two days in house , traffic returned to normal after rains stopped . 
officials said they had asked people in about 200 relief camps in the district to return to their villages . 
moderate to heavy rain , accompanied by winds , had been reported in the coastal areas , meteorological officials said . 
&quot; But tidal waves and cyclonic winds have not yet started , &quot; said Hyderabad meteorological centre director C.V.V. 
Bhadram . 
&quot; It is pretty difficult to predict when the storm will hit the coast . 
its erratic behaviour makes it unpredictable . 
the storm would be the second in a month to hit Andhra Pradesh . 
at least 2,000 people were killed or are missing after last month &apos;s cyclone .
