Rail-mounted launchers and mobile SS-25 missiles will provide the cornerstone of Russia &apos;s nuclear shield after far-reaching military reforms , a senior Kremlin official said on Tuesday . 
Yuri Baturin , secretary of President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s Defence Council , told Interfax news agency Russia needed moveable and easily concealed missile complexes , such as the Topol ( Poplar ) , known under NATO classifications as the SS-25 . 
Baturin added , however , that Russia would also develop its traditional silo-based missile complexes , strategic bomber fleet and nuclear submarines . 
the latter formed the main nuclear strike force in Soviet times . 
earlier this month , Yeltsin formally announced long-planned reforms , including cutting troop numbers by 500,000 to 1.2 million by the end of 1998 . 
last year he promised to create a fully professional , non-conscript army by 2000 , though that deadline appears to have been quietly dropped . 
the reform , putting the stress on combat readiness and new weapons , will also restructure the strategic command . 
Yeltsin wants to turn the armed forces into a smaller and more efficient fighting force after years of declining standards which culminated in humiliation at the hands of separatists in Chechnya last year .
