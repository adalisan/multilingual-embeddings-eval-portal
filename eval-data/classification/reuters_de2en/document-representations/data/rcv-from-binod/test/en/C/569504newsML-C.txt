international Business machines Corp. stock jumped Thursday as two Wall Street firms raised their price targets for the shares a day after an upbeat meeting with the computer maker &apos;s chairman . 
IBM gained $ 5.25 to $ 167.375 in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange , where it was one of the most active issues . 
credit Suisse First Boston raised its 12-month target price for IBM to $ 195 , from $ 165 , and prudential Securities said it expects IBM to hit $ 225 , up from $ 190 previously , and continued to recommend buying the stock . 
&quot; I think management is coming out swinging for a very conservative company , &quot; said Ahmet Chopra at First Boston . 
&quot; They are showing a lot of confidence in their ability to deliver on a business model they have been touting for years . 
IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner met with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday and said the world &apos;s biggest computer maker has many opportunities for growth . 
&quot; We are a very different company today , &quot; Gerstner said . 
&quot; We have very specific programmes to go after our competitiors &apos; business . 
this was not something IBM did in the past because the consent decree made it very difficult for IBM to behave that way . 
last week a federal judge in New York approved a pact between IBM and the Justice Department ending the remnants of the 1956 consent decree that had limited IBM in what has become its fastest growing business -- computer services . 
Gerstner said services was priority for IBM and reiterated the company &apos;s goal for overall revenues to grow steadily but not as quickly as some high-tech companies , which he called &quot; meteors &quot; because some eventually burn up . 
&quot; We are focused on growing shareholder value , &quot; Gerstner said . 
&quot; We have a model that is not the model of the meteors . 
prudential also raised its 1997 earnings estimates to $ 12.50 a share , from $ 12.35 , citing better expense controls . 
IBM earned $ 1.2 billion , or $ 2.37 a share , on revenues of $ 17.3 billion in the first quarter , surpassing most estimates on Wall Street . 
IBM &apos;s fast-growing service businesses offset a decline in its mainframe sales and other lines . 
revenues grew 9 percent in the first quarter , adjusted for currency fluctuations . 
service revenues jumped a strong 28 percent while revenue for some hardware , such as mainframe computers , minicomputers and workstations , declined . 
analysts said they were impressed by IBM &apos;s focus on its need to get products out swiftly and Gerstner &apos;s aggressive attitude . 
&quot; The meeting solidified our view that there is significant long-term revenue and earnings growth opportunities which should lead to a huge stock price over the next two to three years , &quot; Salomon Brothers analyst John Jones wrote in a note to clients . 
Jones said IBM shares should be worth $ 180 as its earnings grow a projected 15 percent in coming quarters . 
IBM led a rally in blue-chip stocks as well as the high-technology sector . 
the Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.97 points to 7,136.62 after falling 140 points on Wednesday .
