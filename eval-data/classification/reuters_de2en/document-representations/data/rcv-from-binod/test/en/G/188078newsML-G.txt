the environmental pressure group Greenpeace said on Thursday a boat it used to protest against genetically altered soybeans had been impounded in Belgium &apos;s Antwerp harbour . 
a spokesman for Greenpeace Belgium told Reuters a bailiff boarded the group &apos;s ship , the Sirius , on Wednesday and demanded payment of 597,000 Belgian francs ( $ 19,250 ) for delays caused by a Greenpeace protest last week . 
he said papers were served on behalf of COBELFRET , a company that had chartered the bulk carrier Bunga saga . 
Greenpeace delayed delivery of what it claimed were genetically altered soybeans from the Bunga saga in Ghent harbour on Sunday . 
a new type of soybean developed by U.S. chemicals group Monsanto to be resistant to the company &apos;s own &quot; super weedkiller &quot; Roundup is dangerous , Greenpeace claims .
