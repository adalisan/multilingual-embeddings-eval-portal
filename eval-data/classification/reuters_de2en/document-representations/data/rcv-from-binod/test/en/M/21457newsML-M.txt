the Mexican peso continued to take a beating on Thursday afternoon on reaction to new rebel violence in two Mexican states and from higher yields on the U.S. long bond , traders said . 
the benchmark 48-hour or spot peso closed four centavos weaker to 7.5350 / 7.5400 , while the 24-hour peso lost 2.8 centavos to 7.5160 / 7.5230 . 
earlier on Thursday , the same-day peso closed two centavos weaker to 7.5040 / 7.5070 
&quot; Some people are saying the internal problems of Mexico aren &apos;t that serious to move the markets too abruptly , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; But foreigners are not going to risk their money when there are armed conflicts in the country . 
apart from the rebel violence , higher rates on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond pressured the peso . 
the long-bond yield climbed as high as 7.05 percent on Thursday afternoon after a hefty upward revision of U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product . 
&quot; The long bond was an additional risk factor for investment in Mexico , &quot; one dealer said .
