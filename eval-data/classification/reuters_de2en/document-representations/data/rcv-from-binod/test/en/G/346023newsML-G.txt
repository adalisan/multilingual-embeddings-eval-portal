&quot; Baywatch &quot; actress and sex symbol Pamela Anderson Lee will debut in a television commercial for pizza hut on Sunday , with a group of men so riveted by their pizza that they ignore her . 
&quot; The ad takes a humorous look at stardom and the fact that our pan pizza is so good that even Pamela will not distract its eaters , &quot; Gary Haigh , pizza hut UK marketing director , said on Thursday . 
in the 30-second ad , Anderson Lee dives into a pizza hut restaurant to avoid clamouring fans outside . 
Anderson Lee , who takes off a green , fake fur coat to reveal a clingy yellow , rubber dress , is quickly spotted by a bunch of open-mouthed diners . 
one says , &quot; Don &apos;t look now . 
it &apos;s Pamela Anderson . 
one of the diners plucks up his courage to talk to Andeson Lee , but becomes mesmerized when his pan pizza arrives . 
he takes a bite from the pizza to steady his nerves and then loses interest in the Canadian-born actress altogether . 
when a waiter passes Anderson Lee , he asks , &quot; Here again , Pam ? 
... For some reason no one ever tries to pick me up . 
the ad follows humorous commercials for pizza hut done by supermodel Linda Evangelista , British footballers Stuart Pearce , Gareth Southgate and Chris Waddle , and British Grand Prix driver Damon Hill and television sports commentator Murray Walker . 
Anderson Lee in December reunited with her husband , motley Crue rock drummer Tommy Lee , two weeks after filing for divorce . 
pizza hut in the UK is jointly owned by U.S.-based PepsiCo Inc , developer of the pizza chain , and Whitbread plc , the British brewing and leisure group .
