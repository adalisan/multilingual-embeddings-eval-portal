the upper chamber of the Russian parliament laid claim on Thursday to the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Sevastopol , saying Moscow had every right to own it . 
&quot; Unilateral actions by the Ukrainian side aimed at tearing away a part of Russia ( Sevastopol ) is not only illegal under international law , but also damages Russia &apos;s interests , &quot; said a resolution passed by the Federation Council . 
the resolution and another document , which formed a special commission to prepare a draft law on the status of Sevastopol , was sure to sour further relations between the two most powerful former Soviet republics . 
neither document is binding on President Boris Yeltsin . 
both were drawn up by powerful Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov and passed by an overwhelming majority . 
Luzhkov argued that a 1954 Kremlin decision to transfer the Crimea peninsula from Russia to Ukraine did not include Sevastopol which had a special status at the time . 
Sevastopol is now the home port of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet , centre of a bitter and unresolved dispute between Moscow and Kiev . 
the second document passed by the Council expressed &quot; concern that the Ukrainian side , against the norm of international law and existing agreements , insists in its refusal to accept the Russian status of Sevastopol &quot; .
