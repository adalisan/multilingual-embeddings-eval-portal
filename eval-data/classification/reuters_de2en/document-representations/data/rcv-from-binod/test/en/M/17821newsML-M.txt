the won closed lower versus the dollar on Tuesday after import settlements and dollar short-covering outweighed month-end export deals , dealers said . 
the won stood at 818.70 at the closing bell against the opening and intra-day high of 818.00 . 
it hit a low of 819.10 . 
&quot; The dollar gained in early trading on import deals and rose further to an intra-day high in late trading on short dollar-covering by foreign banks , &quot; said Kim Young-chun of SEOULBANK . 
dealers said month-end export negotiations and tight won liquidity in money markets blocked the local currency from falling much further . 
they forecast the won to consolidate in a range of 818 to 819.50 on Wednesday with the base mid-rate at around 818.80 . 
today &apos;s mid-rate was put at 817.70 .
