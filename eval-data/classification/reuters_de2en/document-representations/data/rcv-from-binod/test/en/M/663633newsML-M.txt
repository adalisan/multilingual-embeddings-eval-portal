fed cattle were not expected to trade until Tuesday or Wednesday and were seen up $ 1.00 at $ 64.00 , compared with sales last week , several sources said . 
prices were expected to be supported by outlooks for firm beef values this week , they said . 
midday beef prices were quoted up $ 0.44 to $ 0.52 per cwt , with 47 fabricated beef loads sold , USDA reported . 
beef prices were supported by strong seasonal demand as retailers start to book orders for end of June and Independence Day holiday beef promotions , market sources said . 
fed cattle prices this week also were seen buoyed by the ability of feedlots to remain current as confirmed by USDA &apos;s monthly cattle on Feed report last Friday . 
the report showed May feedlot marketings in the seven primary cattle feeding states up four percent from a year ago and a record high for May at 1.8 million head .
