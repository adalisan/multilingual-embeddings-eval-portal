a warplane belonging to the radical Islamic Taleban militia on Friday bombed the town of Jabal Os-Siraj , where the ousted government military chief is headquartered , but there were no casualties . 
the plane flew in from behind the Hindu Kush mountains , attracting a burst of anti-aircraft fire , and dropped a bomb into a nearby field throwing up a cloud of dust at around 7.20 a.m. ( 0250 GMT ) . 
a Taleban jet fighter dropped three bombs above the town , 45 km ( 30 miles ) north of the Afghan capital Kabul , on Thursday with no casualties . 
at least 14 people died in an air attack on the village of Kalakan 25 km ( 15 miles ) north of Kabul on the same day . 
the forces of ousted government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood , along with those of northern Uzbek leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum , are fighting to retake Kabul from the Taleban , who captured the city on September 27 .
