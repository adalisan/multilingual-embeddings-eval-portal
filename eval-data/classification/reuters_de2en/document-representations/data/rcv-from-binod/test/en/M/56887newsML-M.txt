recent coffee price falls sparked physical enquiries for early 1997 in Germany , traders said on Monday . 
&quot; It &apos;s unclear how much more selling there will be on the futures but if December went below 103 / 100 cents again , this could encourage some roaster fixing , &quot; one said . 
&quot; It would also depend on the direction the funds would take . 
DEC New York arabicas last Friday closed at a one-month low of 104.70 cents / lb , down 0.50 , amid origin selling . 
traders put downside resistance on Dec at 98 , 97 , then 96.25 cents . 
outright business was limited as consumers focused on the slow pace of roasted coffee sales rather than empty consumer country stocks . 
consumption in Europe was described as slow amid the generally subdued economic outlook and income restraints . 
traders said key growers were in the process of reducing premiums and consumers saw that as a sign of relief on the supply side . 
&quot; This is bound to result in differential cuts sooner or later ... meantime consumers see no need to take cover , &quot; another trader said . 
nearby Colombian differentials were moving towards 15 over futures from 20 in recent months . 
traders said they expected an industry conference in Hamburg on Tuesday and Wednesday to outline opportunities for regenerating the coffee market . 
&quot; I &apos;d like to hear about ways to stimulate consumption in Europe and how Colombia , Brazil and Central America are going to compete for industrialised country markets in the new season , &quot; one delegate said . 
importers reported sporadic business in Central Americans for Oct / Nov through June 1997 as well as trade in Oct / Nov East African arabica . 
competitive robusta offers for nearby shipment were ignored . 
Brazils cost $ 108 per 50 kg fob , $ 12 less than a fortnight ago , Colombia Excelso coffee at $ 135 was down $ 15 , new crop Kenyans cost $ 139 ( versus $ 153 last mid-crop offers ) and Indonesia CIF robustas for October stood at $ 68 .
