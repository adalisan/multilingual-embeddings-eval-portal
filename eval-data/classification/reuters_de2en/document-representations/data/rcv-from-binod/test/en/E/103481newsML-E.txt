two years after the introduction of an IMF-backed stability programme in the aftermath of a 1994 financal crisis , the Turkish economy is again in desperate need of the fund &apos;s assistance , officials said on Tuesday . 
officials say the IMF may put forward more strict terms to back Turkey &apos;s efforts to rescue the inflation-ridden economy . 
an IMF team is expected to arrive in Ankara on October 14 to examine the economy and Turkey &apos;s 1997 targets and budgetary aggregates for about three weeks ahead of possible talks for a stand-by arrangement later in November , officials said . 
&quot; They will probably ask Turkey to take some prior actions ahead of stand-by talks , &quot; a central bank official said . 
the IMF is expected to wait for a World Bank visit in November to check Turkey &apos;s privatisation efforts before deciding on the feasibility of any new stand-by arrangement . 
officials say the IMF may set some structural reforms , such as privatisation , as key performance criteria and urge the country to narrow its public deficit and lower inflation . 
it may also suggest firm exchange rate targets and fiscal and monetary tightening as part of the economic programme to be carried out under the IMF surveillance . 
the IMF had held up the last tranche of a $ 740-million stand-by loan , agreed in July 1994 , after Turkey diluted its 1994 stability programme ahead of December &apos;s general elections . 
&quot; The fund will now seek for a firm government commitment in the economic programme and stand-by arrangement , &quot; said a treasury official . 
that might be an obstacle to any accord . 
the Islamist Welfare Party of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has signalled no change in its opposition to the IMF , long a key party plank . 
&quot; If Erbakan blocks the deal then that might mean he is planning to go for early elections next year . 
early elections will be unlikely to me if he says &apos; okay &apos; , &quot; a senior economy official said . 
economists say tough measures to be recommended by the IMF may not fit into Erbakan &apos;s populist policies , such as granting wage hikes to public employees . 
the centre-right wing of the coalition government , Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller &apos;s True Path Party , appeared as the leading advocate for an IMF deal . 
State Minister Ufuk Soylemez , a Ciller loyalist , said any support by IMF for Turkey &apos;s economic programme would increase the country &apos;s ability to borrow in international markets . 
the IMF &apos;s backing in 1994 paved the way for Turkey to borrow abroad in early 1995 , after a year &apos;s absence from borrowing markets due to the financial crisis . 
bankers say foreign creditors may tighten their lending to Turkey and rating agencies may downgrade its rating unless the country wins the IMF backing . 
the economy is struggling with high inflation of around 80 percent . 
economists say the current account deficit is likely to exceed the record high of $ 6.4 billion reached in 1993 . 
( corrects year of record high deficit ) . 
the public sector borrowing requirement may overshoot 10 percent of gross national product , after about six percent in 1996 . 
slow progress in privatisation and efforts to reform loss-making pension funds is another source of concern for the economy .
