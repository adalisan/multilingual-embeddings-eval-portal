Juan Gonzalez , merrily making up for lost time , homered twice and drove in six runs to hoist the Texas Rangers to an 8-1 victory over the Oakland Atheltics Saturday for their fourth straight win . 
Bobby Witt ( 10-4 ) and Xavier Hernandez combined on a three-hitter as the second place Rangers climbed within five games of the Seattle mariners in the Al West . 
Gonzalez , last season &apos;s league MVP , had a pair of two-run homers , a sacrifice fly and a run-scoring groundout . 
the homers gave Gonzalez , who missed the first month of the season due to injury , 20 for the year , his sixth 20-homer season breaking the team mark he shared with Pete Incaviglia . 
&quot; I &apos;m a bit surprised , &quot; said Gonzalez of his home run total . 
the second half I need to continue to hit the ball hard and drive in runs , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There is good chemistry in the clubhouse . 
everybody is close right now , we have a better attitude overall as a team than we had a few weeks ago . 
Rangers manager Johnny Oates agreed . 
&quot; It &apos;s good to end the first half of the season like this , &quot; Oates said . 
Witt ( 10-4 ) allowed just three hits , with Oakland &apos;s only run coming on a seventh-inning Homer by Mark McGwire , his major league leading 31st of the season . 
&quot; Juan ( Gonzalez ) came through with a couple of big bombs and it &apos;s a lot easier pitching with a lead , &quot; Witt said . 
McGwire &apos;s Homer was the 360th of his career , moving him past Johnny Mize into 43rd place on the all-time list . 
in Anaheim , Gary DiSarcina singled with one out in the ninth to score Orlando Palmeiro as the Anaheim angels edged the Seattle mariners 5-4 to snap a three-game losing streak . 
the angels trailed 4-1 after five innings but rallied to tie the game on Tim Salmon &apos;s three-run blast in the eighth off reliever Scott Sanders . 
in the ninth , lead-off batter Todd Greene beat out an infield grounder when pitcher norm Charlton ( 2-6 ) missed first base after taking a flip from Paul Sorrento . 
Palmeiro ran for Greene and was sacrificed to second by Craig Grebeck . 
Charlton balked to move Palmeiro to third and DiSarcina lined a 2-2 pitch up the middle for the winning run . 
Troy Percival ( 3-4 ) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win . 
in Detroit , Terry Mathews &apos;s wild pitch during an intentional walk in the bottom of the eighth inning allowed Travis Fryman to score the go-ahead run as the Detroit Tigers rallied for a 6-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles . 
&quot; If I knew what happened , then it wouldn &apos;t have had happened , &quot; Matthews said . 
&quot; You don &apos;t pitch there , all you &apos;re doing is playing catch with the catcher . 
there &apos;s no explanation for what happened . 
that &apos;s what makes it so disgusting . 
Detroit trailed 5-3 entering the eighth before rallying for three runs . 
Brian Hunter led off with a single off Orioles starter Mike Mussina . 
after Jesse Orosco ( 2-1 ) relieved Mussina , Phil Nevin tied the game with a pinch two-run Homer . 
reliever Dan Miceli ( 2-1 ) got the win , and Todd Jones worked the ninth for his 13th save . 
Mussina , who tired and left in the seventh , registered 14 strikeouts . 
in Toronto , Andy Pettitte tossed a six-hitter for his first career shutout as the New York Yankees ended a week-long offensive drought with an 8-0 defeat of the Toronto Blue Jays . 
Pettitte ( 9-5 ) walked two and struck out six in his 79th career start . 
&quot; It &apos;s special , it was a great feeling , &quot; Pettitte said . 
&quot; Hopefully I won &apos;t have to wait as long for another one . 
Toronto starter Pat Hentgen ( 8-6 ) , who beat out Pettitte for CY Young Award honours last season , took the loss . 
in Milwaukee , Cal Eldred allowed one run and three hits over seven innings as the Milwaukee Brewers ended a five-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the Minnesota twins . 
Eldred ( 8-8 ) walked just one as he gave the Brewers &apos; bullpen a breather one game after five Milwaukee pitchers were battered for 23 hits in a 13-1 loss to the twins . 
in Cleveland , Charles Nagy pitched seven innings for his first win in almost three weeks and Marquis Grissom &apos;s two-run double keyed a four-run second inning as the Indians handed the Kansas City Royals their seventh straight loss , 8-4 . 
Nagy ( 9-4 ) allowed all four runs and six hits . 
Manny Ramirez , Brian Giles and Jim Thome homered for the tribe . 
in Chicago , Tony Pena drove in four runs to double his season RBI total as the Chicago White SOx spoiled the return of Steve Avery with an 11-8 victory over the Boston Red SOx . 
Pena , who entered the game with a .163 batting average , went 3-for-4 with a two-run double in a three-run fifth inning . 
Mike Cameron and Frank Thomas homered for the SOx . 
Avery ( 2-2 ) made his first start in more than two months since straining a groin muscle on May 4 .
