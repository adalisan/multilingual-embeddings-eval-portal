Australia , who play Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday , have been so hit by injuries that 35-year-old fitness trainer Dirk Williams -- a New Zealander -- has been drafted in for Tuesday &apos;s match against the Scottish Districts Select XV in Perth . 
with both number eights Mike Brial and Mark Connors injured and the Wallabies wanting to protect the test team as much as possible , coach Greg Smith was forced to name Williams on the blindside flank . 
Williams represented New Zealand Schools and Colts before playing provincial rugby for Otago and Wellington . 
he made it as far as the All Black trials but no further . 
he currently plays for the Eastern suburbs club in Sydney and was voted the best and fairest player in the Sydney premiership earlier this year . 
&quot; I have been in Australia for eight years now so it &apos;s definitely home now and it &apos;s a great honour to play for the Wallabies , &quot; Williams said . 
&quot; I was a bit surprised by it but I suppose if you look at the injuries then it makes reasonable sense .
