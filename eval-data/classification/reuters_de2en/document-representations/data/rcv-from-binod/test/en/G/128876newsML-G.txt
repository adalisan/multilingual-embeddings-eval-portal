springbok coach Andre Markgraaff has received deaths threats after dropping victorious World Cup captain Francois Pienaar from the national squad , the Johannesburg Sunday Times reported . 
it said the threats had prompted Markgraaff to stay away from a match on Saturday between Transvaal and Northern Transvaal , playing for a place in the Currie Cup final . 
Transvaal , led by Pienaar , won the match in Pretoria . 
Pienaar put in a storming performance that critics of Markgraaff said proved he had been wrong to drop the flanker . 
the Sunday Times quoted Markgraaff as saying he had received about 100 phone calls since announcing Pienaar &apos;s axing from the squad to tour Argentina , Wales and France in November and December . 
about half of them had been abusive and some of those had included threats against his life , the paper quoted him as saying . 
Markgraaff was unavailable for comment on Sunday but Alex Broun , spokesman for the South African Rugby Football Union , said he thought the report was &quot; legitimate &quot; . 
one of Markgraaff &apos;s colleagues on the three-man national selection panel , Ray Mordt , quit the panel last week in protest at Pienaar &apos;s exclusion . 
Mordt , who also coaches Transvaal , said after the match on Saturday : &quot; Without a doubt , Francois &apos;s performance has proved Markgraaff wrong . 
public opinion polls conducted last week showed overwhelming support for Pienaar to be kept on as captain of the national squad .
