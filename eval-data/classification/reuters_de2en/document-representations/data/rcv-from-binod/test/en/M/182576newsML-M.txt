U.S. Gulf Coast conventional unleaded gasoline stole the limelight on an otherwise sleepy trading day Tuesday , players said , jumping another two cents a gallon on the heels of similar gains Monday . 
Gulf traders described continued tightness of &quot; M4 &quot; unleaded and slim activity as many players remained away at the American Petroleum Institute &apos;s ( API ) annual meeting being held this week in Washington , D.C. 
prompt front-33rd-cycle &quot; M4 &quot; was talked between 1.75 cents and 2.25 cents over December futures , one cent firmer than Monday differentials , players said , with one deal mentioned but not confirmed at 2.50 cents over . 
Gulf traders kept a sharp lookout Tuesday for the reappearance of the Wall Street brokerage firm Morgan Stanley , which they said snapped up as many as 300,000 barrels of &quot; M4 &quot; Monday . 
&quot; They probably owe refiners , were expecting the market to go down , and now have to short cover , &quot; he said , adding that razor-thin activity Tuesday allowed prices to rise on limited numbers of deals .
