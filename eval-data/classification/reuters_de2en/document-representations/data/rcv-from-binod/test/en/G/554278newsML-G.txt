Britain was set to vote for change on Thursday and elect a Labour government under Tony Blair after 18 years of Conservative rule that transformed the country . 
opinion polls predicted Labour was heading for a convincing victory over the ruling Conservatives , who came to power in 1979 under Margaret Thatcher and have since won three elections . 
the last poll of the campaign showed Labour on 47 percent , with an 18-point lead over Prime Minister John Major &apos;s party . 
a record 3,717 candidates are standing for 659 seats , eight more than in 1992 because of boundary changes . 
polling stations opened at 0600 GMT in bright sunshine but in the shadow of violence by the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) , which has disrupted the six-week campaign with a string of bombs and hoaxes . 
Blair and his wife Cherie took their three young children to the polling station in Sedgefield , north-east England , giving them a glimpse of the media frenzy that awaits them if they change homes to Downing Street on Friday . 
Blair , in shirt sleeves , crossed a soccer pitch belonging to a local coal mine for one last photo-call before voting . 
he looked nervous but told an army of reporters and cameramen he felt fine . 
aides said Blair was making no predictions of victory but anecdotal evidence was encouraging . 
police wearing bullet-proof jackets guarded Blair &apos;s redbrick house nearby . 
voters were warned that their bags might be searched because of the IRA threat but early voters at polling stations near London said there were few signs of unusual security . 
the Home Office ( interior ministry ) last week sent leaflets to 45,000 electoral officers advising how to cope with bomb threats . 
if necessary , voting in affected areas would be continued on Friday . 
its political arm Sinn Fein hopes to win three constituencies at the election but would refuse to take its seats in the London parliament . 
major , dressed in Conservative blue tie , shirt and suit , looked relaxed when he voted in his constituency of Huntingdon , north of London , with wife Norma . 
smiling , he shook hands with journalists who had followed him during the longest campaign for 80 years . 
the polls have shown that Blair has been heading for victory ever since he took over leadership of Labour in July 1994 . 
he has transformed his party , shedding many of its key socialist tenets in a move to the centre ground . 
but , remembering the bitter disappointment of Major &apos;s surprise win in 1992 , he has warned voters not to be complacent and allow the Conservatives to snatch a record fifth successive win . 
voting finishes at 2100 GMT and exit polls , which can give a good estimate of the final result , are expected shortly afterwards . 
analysts expect any Labour victory to be less conclusive than opinion polls suggest because of the vagaries of Britain &apos;s first-past-the-post electoral system . 
the Conservatives have put together the longest stretch of single-party government in Britain this century and about one quarter of Britons cannot remember life under a Labour government . 
labour last won an election in 1974 when Blair was a student at Oxford University . 
Blair became a member of parliament in 1983 and will be Britain &apos;s youngest prime minister this century , in succession to Major , if he wins . 
major has called tne country &apos;s apparent desire for change his &quot; phantom enemy &quot; , but voters have also become disillusioned with his perceived lack of leadership and his party &apos;s divisions over Europe . 
no party has ever come back from such an opinion poll deficit to win .
