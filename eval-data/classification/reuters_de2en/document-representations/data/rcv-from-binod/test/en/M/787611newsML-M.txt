the Polish zloty slipped to its Thursday lows of around -1.2 percent from the trading band centre in early trade on domestic speculative dollar-buying and was seen losing more ground later today , dealers said . 
they expected the local unit to continue its decline until some -1.3 percent from parity after it made a stronger opening on a large Polish exporter &apos;s dollar-sell order , dealers said . 
&quot; Today the support level of -1.5 percent will not likely be tested as this would entail large moves , which are not likely on a Friday , &quot; said Andrzej Fiderkiewicz , forex dealer at Societe Generale in Warsaw . 
at 0755 GMT the zloty was at -1.06 / -1.15 percent from its currency basket against -0.89 / -1.10 at opening . 
it was at 3.5100 / 15 to the dollar and 1.8720 / 30 to the mark against 3.5000 / 70 and 1.8760 / 00 at opening respectively . 
some dealers said the zloty may get a boost next week from short-term foreign capital inflows as speculative players had been closely monitoring the Polish market since Monday &apos;s official interest rate rise and checking rates . 
&quot; There is a chance that foreigners will return shortly , as the zloty level seems attractive for them to make gains , &quot; said Piotr Czyzewski , forex dealer at ING Bank in Warsaw . 
on the money market one-day rates were flat and dealers expected them to be stable at around 23 percent which seemed to be a support level below which banks would not lower rates . 
Overngight rates traded at 23.05 / 23.25 against opening &apos;s 23.00 / 23.20 . 
tomorrow / next rates were at 22.93 / 23.40 against 22.95 / 23.20 at opening . 
dealers awaited a central bank 14-day reverse repo auction , which would set new market rate level after the nominal rate increase by two and 2.5 points to 27 percent for the Lombard and 24.5 percent for the discount rate on Monday .
