strong buying in electronics in the final hour pulled the Taiwan stock index to a sharply higher finish on Friday and brokers said the index soon might test strong resistance at 7,200 points . 
the index gained 84.01 points or 1.20 percent to end at 7,094.77 , off an intra-session high of 7,111.70 . 
sentiment was cautious early on after Thursday &apos;s launch of Taiwan stock-index futures in Singapore and Chicago , which fuelled cash market volatility , but little new impact was seen as Taiwan still bans local trading on the offshore contracts . 
seeing no signs of retreat from Friday &apos;s initial gains , investors piled in to buy fundamental-backed electronic shares , which buoyed Taiwan &apos;s market in much of 1996 , brokers said . 
interest was also seen in firms related to the mobile phone industry as the Ministry of Transport and Communications is expected soon to announce the winning bidders for the island &apos;s lucrative mobile phone franchises . 
seventeen joint ventures , some led by international telecom giants , have submitted 42 applications to run newly liberalised mobile telephone franchises that analysts say could yield up to US $ 3.6 billion a year in sales after a decade . 
easy money has been a factor in this week &apos;s rally . 
&quot; Interest rates are low now , so liquidity is fairly loose and that should push share prices higher in the near term , &quot; said Albert Lin , research manager of Golden Securities . 
the electronic sector soared 3.3 percent , with the market &apos;s most active issue , Mitac International , rising T $ 1.5 or five percent to T $ 32.5 and Pacific Wire and Cable jumping the daily seven percent limit to T $ 26.7 . 
brokers said political concerns sparked by Taiwan provincial governor James Soong &apos;s December resignation were decreasing as the market focused mainly on the recovering economy at home .
