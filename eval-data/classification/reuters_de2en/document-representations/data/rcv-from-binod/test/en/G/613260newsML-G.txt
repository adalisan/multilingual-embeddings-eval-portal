a row between Sydney Olympics organisers and the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) was resolved on Monday when the governing body said a proposed hotel bed tax to help fund the 2000 Games was a domestic issue . 
new South Wales state premier Bob Carr on Friday told Juan Antonio Samaranch to mind his own business after the IOC chief criticised the organisers for imposing the levy . 
but the IOC said in statement on Monday it had told Sandy Hollway , president of the Games organisers , the bed tax was &quot; a matter purely for the New South Wales government to determine &quot; . 
&quot; The IOC has never sought and will never seek to intervene in Australian and New South Wales politics , &quot; it said . 
the New South Wales state government , which is funding much of the massive construction costs for the Games , plans to impose a 10 per cent hotel bed tax starting from September 1 this year . 
the tax is projected to raise A $ 64 million ( US $ 50.07 million ) a year , offsetting a projected A $ 3.2 billion bill for building Olympic facilities , about two-thirds of which is being met from the public purse . 
Samaranch had said the IOC was not happy with the tax , adding : &quot; We can do nothing -- only tell the organisers that we are not happy &quot; .
