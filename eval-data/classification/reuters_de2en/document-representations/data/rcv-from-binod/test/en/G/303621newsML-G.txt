British scientists reported on Monday that children living on newly created housing estates in Hong Kong were more likely to develop leukaemia . 
they said their findings added evidence to theories that population mixing could be responsible for certain types of cancer -- perhaps through an unusual immune reaction or a virus . 
Dr Freda Alexander and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh found clusters of childhood leukaemia in Hong Kong &apos;s New Territories , a mostly rural area where many enormous housing complexes have been built recently . 
&quot; It is clear that substantial movements of large populations do occur in Hong Kong when new housing estates are built , especially in the New Territories where population density was relatively low in the 1970s , &quot; they wrote in the British Journal of Cancer , published by the Cancer Research Campaign charity . 
Alexander &apos;s group looked at 261 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia between 1984 and 1990 . 
the charity said the report added to evidence that clusters of cancer around power plants were due to population mixing , caused by movements of temporary workers and their families , rather than radiation . 
&quot; We believe that the more we understand about the causes of childhood leukaemias , the more likely it is that one day we will be able to prevent them , perhaps by simple vaccination , &quot; CRC director-general Gordon McVie said in a statement . 
Dr David Grant , scientific director of the leukaemia Research Fund , said the environment could be in part responsible for the illness . 
&quot; Increasingly it looks like the explanation , at least in part , might lie in a rare immune response in a child , set off by a common infection , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What this does not mean is that childhood leukaemia is infectious .
