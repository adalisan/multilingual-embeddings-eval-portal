fighting flared in Lebanon on Monday , killing nine civilians on Israel &apos;s only active border frontline just as Israel mended fences with Palestinians over a suicide attack . 
Lebanese militiamen led by pro-Israeli commander Antoine Lahd fired three rounds of shells at Lebanon &apos;s southern port of Sidon , killing six civilians and wounding 34 , many of them seriously , security sources said . 
&quot; We have two heads and parts of bodies in the post-mortem room . 
many people came but nobody was able to identify them . 
we still don &apos;t know who they belong to , &quot; said a medic at Sidon &apos;s Ghassan Hamoud hospital . 
Israel &apos;s army denied firing the shells , instead blaming the attack on forces serving under Lahd around the Jezzine area outside an occupation zone patrolled by Israel and Lahd &apos;s South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) . 
&quot; The SLA is backed by Israel whereas the people who fired are not backed by Israel , &quot; an Israeli military source said in a bid to distance Israeli troops from the attack . 
Israel and its SLA allies patrol a 15-km ( nine-mile ) deep border zone set up inside Lebanon with the declared aim of preventing guerrilla attacks on Israel &apos;s northern border . 
Israeli military sources said Lahd &apos;s men were apparently avenging the death of three Lebanese youths killed in a Jezzine explosion hours earlier . 
the Israeli army said Hizbollah , the Iranian-backed &quot; Party of God &quot; , carried out that attack . 
Hizbollah &apos;s top official in south Lebanon , Nabeel Kawouk , threatened retaliation for the 16 shells that landed in Sidon and its suburbs . 
in Jerusalem , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to transfer to the Palestinian Authority about a third of the funds frozen by Israel after a double suicide bombing on July 30 , his spokesman said . 
the decision followed what Netanyahu spokesman Shai Bazak called &quot; partial cooperation &quot; by the authority in the investigation of the marketplace attack which killed 16 people , including the two bombers . 
an aide to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat welcomed the decision , calling it a &quot; positive first step &quot; . 
the United States , the main Middle East peace broker , also hailed the partial thaw . 
in a statement , Netanyahu &apos;s spokesman said : &quot; The prime minister decided today in consultation with the foreign and defence ministers to release about 30 percent of the funds Israel held up and transfer it to the Palestinian Authority . 
Israel &apos;s Treasury said 42 million shekels ( $ 12 million ) would be handed over to the self-rule administration . 
after the twin bombing , Israel clamped a security closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip and froze the funds it owes the Authority under a 1994 economic protocol . 
Arafat has resisted Israeli pressure to round up suspected militants from the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups , as he did in March 1996 after a wave of suicide bombings in Israel . 
Netanyahu has said he suspects Hamas was behind the market bombing but Arafat told reporters on Monday that it was still not clear who the bombers were or where they came from . 
&quot; According to our information and according to other information we have proof that they ( came ) from outside , but from where we don &apos;t know , &quot; Arafat said after talks in Gaza with European Union envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos . 
substantive talks between Israel and the PLO have been deadlocked since Israel broke ground in March on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem . 
in an Israeli court , three Israeli paramilitary border policemen were charged on Monday with kidnapping and assaulting two Palestinian workers who had entered Israel without permits in the face of the closure . 
the border policemen are suspected of beating the workers , threatening them with a rifle and dragging one of them along the ground tied to a jeep .
