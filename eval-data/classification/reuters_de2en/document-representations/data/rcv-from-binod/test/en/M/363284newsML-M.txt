MGE spring wheat futures ended mixed , with March weak on a perceived sudden increase in country movement and on slack export sales , traders said . 
&quot; I think the weakness in the March has to do with the fact that we don &apos;t have a lot of export business left and yet open interest is still pretty high , so maybe that &apos;s why we saw a liquidation of March longs , &quot; a trader said . 
posted receipts on the MGE cash trading floor showed 301 railcars of spring wheat . 
that marked an increase over previous days and was seen by some as a sign that the grain transportation headaches in the upper Midwest may be ebbing . 
MGE spring wheat closed 3-1 / 4 cents per bushel lower to two cents higher , with March down 3-1 / 4 cents at $ 3.82-1 / 4 . 
the March / May spread erased nearly all of its gains over the past two days , closing at 17 cents after having widened Thursday to trade at 20 cents . 
traders said locals were the biggest sellers of the spread , while flour mills were steady buyers of the March . 
MGE barley futures closed four to five cents per cwt lower , with March down four cents at $ 6.51 .
