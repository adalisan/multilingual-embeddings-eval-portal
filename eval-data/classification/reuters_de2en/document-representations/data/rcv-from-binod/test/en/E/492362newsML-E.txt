Australia &apos;s manufacturing industry showed a modest upturn in the March quarter but the recovery was being hampered by slow export growth , an industry survey published on Monday said . 
the Australian Chamber of manufactures &apos; March quarter manufacturing survey found trends were generally positive for the second straight quarter , after a slowdown over the past two years . 
Chamber chief executive Allan Handberg cautioned the gains were unlikely to be enough to achieve government growth targets for financial 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; Current trends are consistent with quarterly manufacturing growth rising from minus 0.3 percent in December to 0.1 percent in March and perhaps 0.6 in June , &quot; he said in a statement . 
&quot; However , the improvement will barely offset the negative performance of the second half of last year -- and manufacturing &apos;s annual growth is still likely to dip from 1.0 percent in 1996 to only 0.4 percent in the 12 months to the end of June . 
&quot; Manufacturing and jobs growth in the second half of this year are also likely to remain steady rather than spectacular unless budget and long-term strategies are put in place to bolster confidence , investment and exports . 
the survey said business conditions would improve but remain modest in calendar 1997 , with a 2.8 percent increase in production , a 6.1 percent rise in investment and an 11.2 percent jump in exports . 
however , employment was projected to fall 1.8 percent . 
&quot; ... the picture painted suggests cautious and modest optimism about the future , &quot; it said . 
the poll found 33 percent of companies surveyed increased production in the March quarter , compared with 46 percent in the December quarter . 
the survey found that March quarter sales and forward orders were comparatively weak , with 36 percent of companies saying sales increased , compared with 32 percent reporting a fall . 
twenty-six percent of firms showed rises in forward orders , and 24 percent showed declines . 
Handberg said the industry &apos;s performance was undermined by falling export growth . 
&quot; The recovery is being inhibited by a sharp slowing in export growth , &quot; he said . 
the survey polled 640 small , medium and large companies with a combined turnover of A $ 25 billion and 100,000 employees .
