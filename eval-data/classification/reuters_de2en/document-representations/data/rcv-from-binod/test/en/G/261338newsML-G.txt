the United States on Tuesday voiced increasing impatience with Middle East deadlock , saying it was disappointed at the pace of Israeli-Palestinian talks on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank town of Hebron . 
&quot; It appears that the discussions on Hebron are not making the progress that we had all hoped they would make , &quot; Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters . 
Christopher &apos;s remarks contrasted with a more upbeat assessment he gave on Monday when he told a conference on aid to Lebanon that he expected an agreement soon . 
they also followed a sharp attack on Monday by President Bill Clinton on Israel &apos;s policy of promoting Jewish settlements in the West Bank , which he said was &quot; absolutely &quot; an obstacle to the peace process . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been very disappointed , &quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said in the most negative U.S. view yet expressed on the Hebron talks . 
&quot; We felt that the elements of an agreement were there a couple of months ago . 
burns said Washington held Israel and the Palestinians equally to blame for the failure to clinch a deal after nearly three months of negotiations . 
the two sides renewed talks on Monday . 
Hebron is the last of seven West Bank towns from which Israel troops are supposed to redeploy under previous accords , but the talks are bogged down over security arrangements for Hebron &apos;s 400 Jews . 
Christopher , speaking before talks with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini , said that beyond a Hebron deal Washington was pressing the two sides to move on to talks on the final status of Palestinian self-rule areas . 
&quot; We simply need to be persistent in urging the parties to take action , being as constructive and helpful as we can but recognising that the parties themselves are the ones that need to make the difficult decisions , &quot; he said . 
Dini said the European Union , too , would &quot; keep pressures on the parties to come to some positive conclusions . 
at a news briefing later , Burns said : &quot; We are asking the Israelis and Palestinians to put their shoulders to the wheel to get the deal done . 
&quot; This is a time of great tension in the Middle East . 
you don &apos;t want to wait forever to negotiate a deal when that deal is in front of you , &quot; he said .
