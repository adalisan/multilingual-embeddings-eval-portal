former captain Salim Malik &apos;s 15th test century almost certainly ensured Pakistan of a draw in the second and final test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday . 
Malik was unbeaten on 101 scored in 263 minutes with 16 fours as Pakistan , set a massive victory target of 426 in 121 overs , went to tea on the fifth and final day at 166 for three . 
Inzamam-ul-Haq was the other undefeated batsman with one run . 
with only 33 overs remaining to be bowled in the final session , Pakistan looked safe from defeat on a pitch which offered little encouragement for the bowlers . 
Sri Lanka &apos;s only success of the day was the wicket of Ijaz Ahmed after a dour innings of 47 which lasted 265 minutes and included one six and seven fours . 
Ijaz , who was dropped by Chaminda Vaas at long-off at 46 , failed to profit from the lapse when he holed out to the same fielder a run later , giving left-arm spinner Jayantha Silva his first wicket of the innings . 
Ijaz and Malik shared a third wicket partnership of 127 in 236 minutes . 
Malik was fortunate to survive two chances . 
when he had made 44 off-spinner Ruwan Kalpage missed an easy return catch , and at 58 he was put down by Jayantha Silva at extra cover , also off Kalpage .
