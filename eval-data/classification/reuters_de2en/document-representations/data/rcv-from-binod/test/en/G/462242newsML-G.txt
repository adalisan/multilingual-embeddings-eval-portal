Israel &apos;s leaders could decide on Sunday to temporarily limit talks with the PLO to security issues following a suicide bombing that killed three Israelis , a top adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said . 
communications chief David Bar-Illan , commenting on a planned inner cabinet meeting , told Reuters : &quot; There may be a suspension of at least any kind of political negotiations and a decision to concentrate only on security matters until we see some kind of cooperation from the Palestinians . 
&quot; Until we see that they are serious about combatting terrorism , I don &apos;t think the political route will be taken . 
the political issues will not be tackled , &quot; Bar-Illan said . 
he said Israeli and PLO security services had met during the two days since a Palestinian from the Islamic militant group Hamas blew himself up at a Tel Aviv cafe , killing himself and three women and wounding dozens of other people . 
public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said he hoped a planned meeting with Jibril Rajoub , the Palestinian Preventive Security chief in the West Bank , would take place on Sunday as planned a week ago . 
these meetings bring about better coordination for both groups , &quot; Kahalani told Israel Radio . 
Israel and the PLO are partners to self-rule peace accords launched in 1993 .
