Ireland &apos;s central bank said on Tuesday that it expects headline inflation of 2.3 percent in 1997 in its annual monetary policy statement . 
&quot; Price stability remains the basic objective of monetary policy in 1997 and a firm nominal exchange rate for the Irish pound is an essential element of the anti-inflationary strategy , &quot; the central bank said . 
it said that while Ireland had performed well in recent years in relation to inflation there was little room for manoeuvre at this stage . 
earlier the Central Statistics Office data showed January CPI , the first monthly Irish CPI index to be published , down 0.5 percent on November 1996 and up 0.9 percent in the 11 months since February last year . 
this was well below market forecasts which had anticipated a 0.1 to 0.3 percent rise on November and a 1.7 to 1.8 percent increase on February . 
up until now the CSO has published CPI data on a quarterly basis so there are no monthly comparable readings for 1996 . 
the central bank said that while the maximum acceptable rate of inflation for Maastricht qualification is as yet unknown there is little room for manoeuvre . 
&quot; Therefore , if the currency were to weaken significantly , whether because of domestic or external developments , or due to varying market sentiment on the whole EMU process , a tightening of monetary policy would be required , &quot; it said . 
it said equally it was likely that there would be periods of short-run market volatility over the coming year and that it would continue its policy of intervening as necessary for smoothing purposes . 
the approach of EMU may well have unprecedented and largely unpredictable repercussions on market sentiment in relation to interest rates and the exchange rate and will pose difficult dilemmas , the central bank warned . 
it said in such circumstances monetary policy must remain firmly focused on controlling inflation and be sufficiently flexible to cope with changing circumstances . 
&quot; Tigher monetary conditions will be required it the goal of price stability is threatened , &quot; it said . 
money and credit growth have been a source of concern for some time , the central bank said , adding that growth of credit has been largely demand-driven and does not appear to suffer from funding constraints . 
the central bank said the underlying pattern of credit growth is likely to continue over the period ahead , with customers &apos; willingness to incur more debt being governed by their ability to meet repayments . 
but it envisaged some moderation in the growth of money and credit due to the fact that indebtedness has increased in relation to income over the past few years and because some deceleration in economic growth is expected . 
the central bank said it expects real GNP growth to rise by 5.3 percent in 1997 . 
&quot; If there were a fall-off in economic growth , or if inflation strains were to become evident in the economy , there might be a deterioration in credit quality and a need for some tightening of credit standards by lending institutions , &quot; it said .
