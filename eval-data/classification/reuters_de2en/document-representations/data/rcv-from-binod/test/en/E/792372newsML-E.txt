Japan said on Monday that it and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) would provide a total of $ 8 billion in loans to help ease Thailand &apos;s financial crisis . 
finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told reporters Japan would provide $ 4 billion in the form of untied loans from the export-import Bank of Japan , and that overall Japanese loans to Thailand would match the amount provided by the IMF . 
Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya , attending the same news conference , said Bangkok appreciated the efforts made by Japan to help Thailand . 
other potential donors were still behind closed doors discussing whether and how much each would contribute to an overall deal , which would be the biggest loan package for a single country since nearly $ 40 billion went to Mexico in 1995 . 
at that time , the United States led the bailout as the largest donor nation . 
participating in the Tokyo meeting are 14 countries including Thailand and three multilateral financial institutions -- the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank . 
Thailand is looking for $ 12 billion to $ 15 billion to plug financial holes created when it floated the baht last month after failing to defend the currency from speculative attack . 
an IMF official said some of the countries were attending as observers , but added that the breakdown of which ones were observers was unclear and would be decided during the meeting . 
observer nations might not contribute money to an overall rescue package , he said . 
&quot; The meeting is not just something to approve an IMF programme for Thailand . 
I am sure there will be an explanation about the programme to the participants and they will discuss how much each country can support Thailand , &quot; the Tokyo-based official said . 
Thailand , long one of Southeast Asia &apos;s booming &quot; tiger economies &quot; has already introduced an austerity package to meet IMF demands , raising its value-added tax , announcing plans to cut its current account deficit and closing more than half of its financial institutions . 
representatives from 21 Japanese banks are scheduled to meet a senior IMF official on Tuesday to discuss the recent economic conditions in Thailand . 
in addition to government and multilateral support , private Japanese banks -- which have heavy loan exposure to Thailand -- are expected to provide several billion dollars to top up the rescue package . 
Thailand has nearly $ 90 billion in foreign currency debt , and Japanese banks are estimated to be owed about half that amount . 
taking part in the meeting along with the IMF and Thailand are the United States , Japan , Australia , Canada , China , Britain , France , Germany , Hong Kong , Indonesia , South Korea , Malaysia and Singapore .
