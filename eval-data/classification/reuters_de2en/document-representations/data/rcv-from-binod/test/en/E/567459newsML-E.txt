a South Korean belt-tightening campaign that has U.S. exporters and government officials up in arms is likely to dominate talks on Wednesday between the U.S. and South Korean trade chiefs . 
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is expected to tell South Korean Trade Minister Lim Chang-yeul that the United States is upset by the campaign that has hit imports ranging from televisions to cars and believes the government is responsible , U.S. officials said . 
&quot; This is not a frugality campaign , but a government-led anti-import campaign , &quot; said a U.S. trade official . 
the official , who asked not to be identified , said the U.S. government is sensitive to the need of the South Korean government to respond to an economic slowdown , but feels targeting imports is not the solution . 
the problem , said the official , is not imports but economic rigidities and concentration in the hands of a few corporations , some of which are being propped up by the South Korean government . 
Seoul has denied it is involved in the campaign that is designed to curb imports and trim South Korea &apos;s $ 24 billion trade deficit . 
the campaign is being spearheaded by civic and religious groups , but U.S. officials say they have evidence of government complicity . 
exporters have complained that South Korean customs officials are delaying products and that regulatory officials are finding problems with products where they had never had problems before , the U.S. official said . 
the campaign has been aimed at luxury goods and cars have been particularly hard hit . 
American Automobile Manufacturers Association President Andrew Card said in one instance an owner of an American-made car was pulled over by police and was given a ticket because of the tinting on the windows . 
he said the ticket was upheld by a judge even though the car &apos;s specification met South Korean regulations and certificiation requirements . 
he said he has heard of other instances of foreign car owners being targeted by police for tickets . 
in the past owners of foreign cars have been targeted for tax audits . 
&quot; It &apos;s having a chilling effect on purchases , &quot; he said . 
at a time when sales of South Korean cars are rising sharply in the United States , the South Korean market has been &quot; pitifully closed &quot; to U.S. manufacturers despite a 1995 trade agreement aimed at opening Korea &apos;s market , Card said . 
card said the South Korean government needs to make a symbolic gesture to change public attitudes toward imports as well as provide regulatory relief to importers . 
&quot; The South Korean government has to be proactive in demonstrating it is okay to own an American product , &quot; Card said . 
&quot; We would like government to be visible in purchasing American cars .
