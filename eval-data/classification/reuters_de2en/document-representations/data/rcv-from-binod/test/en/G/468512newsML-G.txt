Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt Tuesday called on the computer industry to use its influence to help sway other FCC commissioners to vote yes on a bill that would provide Internet access to schools . 
on May 8 , the FCC will vote on a plan that would require Internet access providers to offer discounts to libraries and schools and would reimburse them by up to $ 2.25 billion a year . 
Hundt told a PC Forum conference here that the FCC already has four commissioners expected to vote in favor of the plan . 
&quot; We need three , &quot; Hundt said . 
he also reiterated that he planned to vote against a bill that would let regional Bell telephone operating companies charge Internet access providers a fee for using their local lines . 
&quot; I &apos;m not going to vote for access charges to be put on Internet access providers , &quot; Hundt said in a speech that focused on the problems of the current education system in the United States . 
Hundt pointed out that currently 65 percent of all public schools have at least one connection to the Internet but there are no telephone lines in the classrooms , adding that most teachers cannot even call for help if they were being held up at gunpoint . 
&quot; There are 45 million people that this communications system does not reach , &quot; Hundt said , referring to the number of students in the United States . 
he called on the industry to e-mail the FCC commissioners to support his plan , adding that the industry has enormous power .
