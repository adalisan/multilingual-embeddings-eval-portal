British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown held discussions with top European Commission officials early on Monday to argue his planned cut in value added tax ( VAT ) on domestic fuel consumption was legal . 
a Treasury official said Brown was telling the European Commissioner Mario Monti and Yves Thibault de Siguy , European Commissioner responsible for monetary affairs , that Labour would cut VAT on fuel to five percent from eight percent . 
&quot; He &apos;s telling them that the cut in VAT on fuel is legally water-tight , &quot; the official said . 
Brown is in Brussels for his first meeting of EU finance ministers . 
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said he expected a more &quot; open minded &quot; approach from Britian in the run-up to June &apos;s inter-governmental conference .
