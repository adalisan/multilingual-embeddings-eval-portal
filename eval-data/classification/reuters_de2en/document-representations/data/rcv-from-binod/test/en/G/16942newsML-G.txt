wide-scale civil war could break out in Burundi and spread to neighbouring states if the country &apos;s military leader failed to open talks with his opponents , Former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere was quoted on Tuesday as saying . 
&quot; I hope talks will begin , because otherwise I foresee a generalised civil war that could destabilise the Great Lakes region , &quot; Nyerere , Africa &apos;s elder statesman , told the French daily Le Monde in an interview . 
Nyerere said that , barring talks , Burundi &apos;s Hutu rebels could link up with the Hutu leaders of Rwanda &apos;s 1994 genocide . 
&quot; This will drag Rwanda into the conflict , and perhaps also neighbouring countries where both camps could find support , &quot; said Nyerere , an internationally backed mediator on Burundi . 
he was due in Rome on Tuesday amid speculation that the Catholic group Sant &apos; Egidio was willing to sponsor talks to promote peace in Burundi . 
around 150,000 people -- mostly civilians -- have died in Burundi since 1993 , when the country &apos;s first democratically elected Hutu president was killed in an attempted army coup . 
in an interview with the French daily La Croix , the head of Burundi &apos;s Frodebu party which was ousted in Tutsi President Pierre Buyoya &apos;s coup , threatened force to regain power and called for international military intervention in Burundi . 
&quot; The junta must return power to the civilians willy-nilly ... If it stays in power we &apos;ll use force , &quot; Jean Minani said . 
asked what he expected from the international community , he said : &quot; That it reinforce sanctions by an armed intervention . 
when peace is restored , we shall be able to negotiate . 
landlocked Burundi is under tough sanctions from its African neighbours following a military coup last month . 
Nyerere said he hoped the sanctions would help Buyoya find a settlement as they helped former South African president F. De Klerk dismantle apartheid . 
&quot; ( Like De Klerk ) Buyoya must be in a position to tell his most hardline supporters : &apos; What is the alternative if we don &apos;t negotiate ? 
&apos; , &quot; he said . 
Nyerere said he had been surprised by the West &apos; lukewarm attitude to the sanctions . 
&quot; I would like western countries which pushed Africa to democracy to support the stand of the African heads of state , &quot; he said .
