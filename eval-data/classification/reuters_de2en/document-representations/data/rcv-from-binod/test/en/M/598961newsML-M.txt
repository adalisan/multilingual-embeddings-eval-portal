U.S. shares were little changed in quiet trade on Tuesday as European participants awaited the outcome of today &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) policy-making meeting . 
&quot; We &apos;re waiting for judgement day , &quot; on market maker said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve had a few small buyers this morning but nothing sensational . 
analysts remained split as to whether the FOMC would vote to increase its short-term funds rate , which it did by 25 basis points after its last gathering on March 25 . 
fed chief Alan Greenspan has stated the central bank would raise its key funds rate again if economic growth continued at the rapid pace seen in the fourth quarter of 1996 and first quarter of this year . 
under Greenspan &apos;s tutelage , the Fed has not moved to tighten or lower interest rates only once during an economic cycle . 
general Motors Corp gained $ 3 / 8 to $ 56-1 / 4 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the automaker had reached an agreement with the Chinese government that makes the company a leading contender to win a car-making project . 
Boeing Co was up $ 1 / 4 to $ 97-3 / 8 on news that the company had been awarded a contract to study the consolidation of NASA &apos;s space operations elements . 
although the deal is worth only $ 4 million , it could lead to larger contracts in the future , dealers said . 
&quot; The NASA contract is seen as a first step into something possibly much bigger , &quot; one dealer said .
