* However , an already fragile market is likely to be directed by the offshore next week . 
Australian bonds ended weaker , but were not totally overwhelmed by Thursday &apos;s sell-off in U.S. treasuries , although sentiment remains severely bruised . 
traders said the market had been wary throughout the day of a further barrage of computerised hedge fund selling after several chart points were broken on the U.S. move , and following yesterday &apos;s heavy session . 
however , the U.S. market steadied in Tokyo trading and local analysts felt the domestic bonds had sufficiently adjusted to recent data suggesting that the local economy was accelerating and that it had now unwound any expectation of a policy easing . 
next week is fairly light on local data , but any signs of stronger growth is expected to be taken negatively by the market , traders said . 
data includes fourth quarter new capital expenditure , while the Department of Industrial Realations is also expected to release its latest quarterly report on enterprise bargaining aggrements . 
the over-riding factor , however , is expected to be Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s Humphrey Hawkins testimony before Congress on February 26 and 27 . 
spread movements within the dollar bloc ended little changed . 
the long-end of the market near enough moved in tandem with the U.S. and slightly outperformed Canada on continued switching to the Australian dollar from the Canadian unit . 
new Zealand pared an early widening after two sets of strong data .
