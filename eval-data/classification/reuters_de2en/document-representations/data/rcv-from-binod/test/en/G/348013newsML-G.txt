Turks plan to plunge their country into darkness to throw some light on a government scandal . 
Engin Cin , an organiser of a campaign entitled &quot; A minute &apos;s darkness for eternal light &quot; , says they want Turks to turn off all their lights for a minute at 1900 GMT each day for a month starting on Saturday . 
the protest aims to press the government to resolve the scandal stemming from a crash on November 3 when a top policeman and a wanted gangster died in the same car . 
an investigation into state ties to the underworld has produced no results , but the media has carried an increasing number of claims that the state is infiltrated by crime gangs . 
&quot; Those who investigate the scandal need support , &quot; Cin told Reuters on Friday . 
&quot; The potential support lies in us , the citizens , in those who do not want to live in a state full of gangs .
