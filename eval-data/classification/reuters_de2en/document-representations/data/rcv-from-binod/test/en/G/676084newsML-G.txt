the United States , France and Russia , as part of their new peace initiative in the oil-rich Caucasus , proposed that Armenia recognise the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave as part of Azerbaijan , western diplomats say . 
the three mediators , operating as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) Minsk Group , have vowed to keep their proposals secret . 
but authoritative diplomatic sources told Reuters that in return for Armenia recognising the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan , Azerbaijan would have to grant Nagorno-Karabakh an extraordinarily high degree of autonomy . 
in Denver , where they are attending the G7 summit , President Bill Clinton , French President Jacques Chirac and Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a joint statement on Friday urging the parties to &quot; take a positive approach , to build upon this proposal and to negotiate an early settlement . 
they expressed deep concern over the continuing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh , affirmed their commitment to help negotiate a resolution and said their proposal was comprehensive &quot; taking into consideration the legitimate interests and concerns of all parties . 
the leaders also warned that &quot; without progress toward a durable settlement , ( a three-year-old ) ceasefire could break down &quot; and said &quot; primary responsibility &quot; for a settlement rests with the parties and their leaders . 
Christian Armenians and Moslem Azeris went to war in the late 1980s over Nagorno-Karabakh , which was mainly populated by Armenians despite being inside Azerbaijan &apos;s borders . 
separatist Armenian forces still hold 20 percent of Azerbaijan &apos;s territory , including Nagorno-Karabakh , captured during the fighting in the early 1990s in which upwards of 35,000 people were killed . 
during the last three years there has been a truce but so far no permanent peace has taken hold . 
U.S. officials are encouraged , however , that with Washington , Paris and Moscow now joining forces to present a unified front and vigorously press a settlement , the conflict could be resolved . 
although the conflict is largely self-contained and hence not much of a threat to countries beyond the borders of Azerbaijan and Armenia , there is substantial international interest in developing oil reserves in Azerbaijan and in building a multi-billion dolar pipeline to transport Caspian Sea oil to western markets . 
experts say this is a key reason behind the new push for peace , which now claims the attention of senior officials , including U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott . 
&quot; This is the classic post-communist , post-Soviet ethnic conflict . 
it &apos;s got ramifications for peace , relations with Russia , Iran , oil , you name it , &quot; one western diplomat said . 
at least twice in recent weeks , U.S. , French and Russian officials have visited the region to discuss their ideas with the affected parties and diplomatic sources say all three of the parties -- including Armenia , Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh -- have taken the proposal seriously . 
sources said the proposal was very detailed and they did not underestimate the difficulty of negotiations now underway . 
some news reports suggested U.S. , Russian and European peacekeepers might be introduced into the region as part of a settlement . 
U.S. and French officials refused comment . 
but Paul Goble , a former State Department official who is an expert on inter-ethnic conflict , told Reuters some kind of multi-national peacekeeping force will be needed to separate the hostile sides because &quot; too much blood has been shed &quot; and Azerbaijan will not accept Russian-only troops . 
he said these forces need not be armed but could be observers to act as a &quot; tripwire &quot; against new violence . 
Goble and other analysts doubt the possibility of a settlement , however . 
&quot; The Armenians see Karabakh in the way that the Israelis see Jerusalem -- as a place which they can never give up , &quot; he said . 
solving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is as complicated as solving a multi-sided puzzle , he said . 
U.S. and other officials say the potential for stability and expanded economic development should be powerful reasons for the parties to make peace . 
but Goble and other experts said a solution must be more comprehensive , possibly requiring that Turkey acknowledge that a 1915 attack on Armenians was genocide , for instance .
