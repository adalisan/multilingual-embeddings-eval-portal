late commission house selling drove CBOT wheat futures to mostly lower closes , with the market still rattled by Tuesday &apos;s near-limit-up surge in corn and rally in soybeans , traders said . 
wheat traders in Chicago , Kansas City and Minneapolis agreed the real key to near-term rallies or breaks in wheat were tied to corn and soybean futures . 
Wednesday , it appeared funds were settling down a bit as demand for corn futures waned in late dealings . 
that triggered selling by locals in corn which touched off a wave of fund long long liquidation in soybeans . 
wheat broke amid that uncertainty . 
wheat open interest figures Tuesday increased about two million bushels , according to the CBOT and were underpinned by remnants of support from the sale of U.S. wheat over the weekend to Pakistan totaling 450,000 tonnes . 
also Taiwan overnight bought 26,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman Tuesday said South Africa agreed to accept U.S. wheat from karnal bunt quarantine areas if it had twice tested negative for the fungus . 
wheat closed 6-1 / 4 cents per bushel lower to 1 / 2 higher , with March down 4-3 / 4 at $ 3.59-1 / 2 a bushel . 
there was talk wheat sold late on the death of China &apos;s Deng Xiaoping but the volume was thin and the near dearth of commercial selling in late trading somewhat voided credence of that talk . 
in late trading , Tenco Inc , Rand Financials and Refco Inc each sold roughly one quarter million bushels of March . 
the Chicago Corp and Cargill Inc each sold about one half million bushels of May and Iowa grain plus LFG futures each sold roughly one quarter million bushels of July , traders said . 
on the day , Continental grain and Merrill Lynch futures each bought two million bushels of July , traders said . 
Smith Barney sold 1.5 million bushels of March , traders said . 
Technicial traders noted the short term nine day relative strength index ( RSI ) for March early Wednesday had moved into neutral territory peaking around at 52 percent . 
traders generally consider an RSI of 30 or less as an oversold market and 70 or more as an overbought market . 
the weekly bullish Consensus hotline showed wheat Tuesday was rising to test short-term resistance . 
signals were bullish short term with support in the March around $ 3.50 to $ 3.44 and resistance from $ 3.86 to $ 3.90 . 
in early dealings the active nearby March remained above the four- and 18-day moving averages ( Ma ) which were acting as a mild bearish magnet . 
March broke below those trendlines and set a session low of $ 3.58-1 / 2 , just two cents above first support at $ 3.56 . 
second support was at $ 3.46-1 / 2 . 
the session high for March was $ 3.68 . 
wheat futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 17,000 contracts , above the 15,792 traded Tuesday . 
in wheat options , E.D. 
and F. Man International sold 300 July $ 3.60 calls at 13-1 / 4 cents , FIMAT futures bought 200 September $ 3.10 puts at six cents and Man also sold 300 July $ 3.70 calls at 10-1 / 4 cents , traders said . 
wheat options volume was estimated at 5,000 contracts , about the same as the 5,329 traded Tuesday .
