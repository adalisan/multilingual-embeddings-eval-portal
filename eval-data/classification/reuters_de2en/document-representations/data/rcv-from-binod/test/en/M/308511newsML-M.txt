Colombia &apos;s peso closed slightly higher after a day of active trading on the country &apos;s interbank market fueled by widespread speculation , and some confusion , about emergency economic measures adopted by the government . 
the peso , which traded in a 1,020 to 1,027 range , closed at 1,022.6 , up one peso on the dollar from Tuesday &apos;s close . 
the peso plummeted to an intraday low of 1,040 Tuesday on the back of the government &apos;s announcement that it was clamping a 6.0 percent tax on foreign debt sold by local companies -- a move that analysts say should stem the flow of dollars into the economy and halt the steady appreciation of the peso that has hurt exports . 
traders said there was still confusion over the tax , however , and that the market saw no shortage of dollars in Wednesday &apos;s trade despite expectations that U.S. currency will soon become much more expensive to buy . 
the government has said it hopes to see the peso devalue by at least 15 percent against the dollar this year . 
dealers said an above-average $ 167 million changed hands in Wednesday &apos;s trade , off just slightly from the $ 168 million in trading Tuesday .
