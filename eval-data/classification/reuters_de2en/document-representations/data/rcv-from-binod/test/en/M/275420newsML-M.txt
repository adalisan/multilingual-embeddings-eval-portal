Indian call money ended Tuesday at 10.5 percent , off the day &apos;s high of 12.50 percent as demand eased , dealers said . 
they said rates fell on lack of demand in the afternoon as borrowers kept off the market at higher levels . 
call money opened Tuesday in the 11.0-12.0 percent range and touched 12.5 percent in stray deals , they said . 
&quot; The higher rates in the morning came about largely due to sentiment , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; The market had initially apprehended a tightening in liquidity after yesterday &apos;s auction . 
&quot; A 20-billion rupee auction of three-year securities conducted by the Reserve Bank of India on Monday was over-subscribed . 
dealers said rates firmed initially on fears the outflows towards subscription would shrink the supply of funds . 
&quot; But there was no perceptible change in liquidity , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; Once borrowers realised this , rates came down . 
he said the 11 percent barrier , the rate at which banks can avail refinance against export credit disbursals , remained a major resistance level . 
dealers said they expected rates to remain between 10 and 11 percent through the current fortnight . 
prices of governemnt securities were largely steady in moderate trade , dealers said . 
&quot; Prices were steady to firm , &quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank . 
&quot; As call rates eased there was some activity in securities , the bulk of it in the security auctioned yesterday . 
the 13.40 percent 1999 stock auctioned on Monday at par ( 100 rupees ) was traded on Tuesday between 99.95 rupees and 100.05 , dealers said . 
dealers said there were no trades in commercial paper or certificates of deposit . 
the money market is closed on Wednesday for Christmas . 
banks reopen on Thursday .
