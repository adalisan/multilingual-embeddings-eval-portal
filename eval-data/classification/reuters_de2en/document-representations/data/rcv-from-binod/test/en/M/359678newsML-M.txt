Dutch bonds ended mixed to lower on Thursday , after an uninspired day . 
&quot; Trade &apos;s absolutely dead at the moment , &quot; one dealer said . 
dealers said little trade was done on behalf of end investors , adding most activity came from professional parties . 
&quot; They have nothing else to do but calling each other , there are no other parties on the market , &quot; one dealer said . 
dealers said the recently issued 5.75 percent February 2007 state loan , which is broadly considered to be the new ten-year benchmark , was pressured by switching into corporate bonds of about the same maturity . 
&quot; Yesterday &apos;s BNG loan attracted quite a lot of interest , although it &apos;s relatively expensive , &quot; one dealer said . 
the one billion guilder ten-year BNG was issued on Wednesday at a premium of only 15 basis points to the equivalent government bond . 
he said ten-year NIB loan issued in December also pressured the benchmark . 
another trader said foreign end investors had started to realise the 2007 was the new ten-year benchmark , switching out of the former benchmark -- the Jan 2006s . 
the lengthening started a couple of days ago , continued . 
&quot; They switch out of 2000s in 2004 , 2005 , 2006s , &quot; one said . 
the 1998 bond added 0.02 at 103.98 / 104.06 , yieding 3.33 percent at bid . 
September 2001s climbed 0.04 to 117.34 / 44 , for a bid yield of 4.48 percent , while the new February 2007s lost 0.06 to 100.98 / 101.06 for a bid yield of 5.62 percent . 
the 10-year yield spread versus the January 2007 Bund was steady at -6 basis points . 
the long bond , the January 2023 closed at 114.57 / 77 , 6.34 percent bid yield , down from 114.69 / 89 . 
the German jobless figures released in the morning were broadly as expected and already included in price levels when they became official , thus not giving much support to the market throughout the rest of the day , dealers said . 
Unadjusted pan-German unemployment climbed to 4.66 million in January to a post war a record percentage of 12.2 . 
dealers say the market was already looking ahead at Friday &apos;s U.S. economic data . 
&quot; I hope U.S. payrolls will cause some fireworks tomorrow , &quot; one dealer said .
