Istanbul shares posted sharp gains on Monday as active trade continued from last week on technical grounds and the market ignored the possibility of early elections to be held by end-1997 , brokers said . 
the IMKB National-100 closed up 60 points , or 3.76 percent at 1,655 after falling from a high of 1,673 on profit taking . 
trade volume edged lower to 31.97 trillion lira ( $ 225.6 million ) from Friday &apos;s 32.69 trillion ( $ 232.8 million ) . 
the index had jumped 8.7 percent last week mainly on hopes of an alternative alliance to replace the ruling Islamist-led coalition government . 
&quot; The 1,600 resistance was pierced . 
the market was not affected by news of early elections because technically , it was at a good point and there was liquidity . 
but there is no substantial expectation to back such a fast rise , &quot; said Koray Cervatoglu from Baran securities . 
Hasan Ekinci , deputy chairman of the junior coalition party True Path ( DYP ) said snap polls would be held by end-1997 under a deal with Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan who has announced that he would step down in favour of DYP leader and deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller within a month . 
Turkish parliament must set the date for elections with a majority vote . 
the coalition has 274 seats in the 550-member parliament , with two seats vacant . 
analysts say a group of DYP deputies may vote against early polls after only two years in office on fears they may not be reelected . 
the inability to pass an election law might give the secularist opposition the chance to set up a new coalition . 
&quot; The rise which began last week has nothing to do with politics although uncertainty had prompted sharp falls in the previous weeks , &quot; said Erhan Topac , general manger of Gedik securities . 
&quot; Prices had become cheap , so the market rebounded with the help of some liquidity inflow after selling pressure faded . 
elections seem far away when considering that the average maturity for our ( stock ) investors is 15 days , &quot; he told Reuters .
