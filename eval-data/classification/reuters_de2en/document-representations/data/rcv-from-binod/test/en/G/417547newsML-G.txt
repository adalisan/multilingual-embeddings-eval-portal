Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez turns 70 this week , three decades after he put Colombia on the literary map with the publication of &quot; One Hundred Years of solitude . 
friends and family members say the world &apos;s most renowned Colombian is unlikely to celebrate at home , however , since the violence-torn country he knows perhaps too well is one in which he currently refuses to live . 
widely considered Latin America &apos;s greatest living literary master , Garcia Marquez was born on March 6 , 1927 , in the small town of Aracataca , near the Caribbean coast in Colombia &apos;s northern province of Magdalena . 
he lived through the undeclared civil war known as &quot; La Violencia , &quot; in which some 300,000 Colombians were killed between 1948 and 1957 . 
violence , along with the physical and moral hardships of life in rural Colombia , are central themes throughout his work . 
a business associate quoted Garcia Marquez , who acknowledges being a great admirer of William Faulkner and is a close friend of William Styron , as having told her last month he was &quot; disgusted &quot; with his homeland and had no intention of returning to Colombia until President Ernesto Samper leaves office in August 1998 . 
&quot; He doesn &apos;t want to return . 
he &apos;s disgusted , scandalised by what &apos;s going on in the country and disillusioned with the government , &quot; Maria Elvira Samper , director of the QAP television news programme , told Reuters . 
politics may have something to do with his self-imposed exile , since he urged President Ernesto Samper to step down at the height of last year &apos;s political crisis stemming from Samper &apos;s allegedly drug-financed election campaign . 
but research for his latest book , a non-fiction account of a string of political kidnappings carried out by Colombian drug lords as part of their fight against extradition to the United States , may also have made him overly aware of the dangers of living in a land with a double-barrelled claim to one of the world &apos;s highest kidnapping and murder rates . 
in a statement to the RCN radio network on Feb . 19 , explaining why he had abandoned his homes in Bogota and Cartagena , if only temporarily , Garcia Marquez alluded to the threat to his personal safety . 
&quot; The situation in Colombia has become uncomfortable , insecure and uneasy , &quot; he said . 
Margarita Marquez , Garcia Marquez &apos;s cousin and Bogota-based secretary , declined to comment on the reasons behind his latest exile from Colombia . 
he spends most of his time now in Mexico , but has lived abroad in Cuba and elsewhere for most of the past 40 years , and recently was reported to have attended a state dinner with President Bill Clinton . 
Marquez also would not comment on plans for his birthday , saying only &quot; he &apos;s resting somewhere in solitude . 
Garcia Marquez has described Colombia as &quot; a dense and indecipherable &quot; place in which &quot; the implausible is the only measure of reality . 
&quot; The same is probably true of most of Latin America , and writers like Guatemala &apos;s Miguel Angel Asturias and Cuba &apos;s Alejo Carpentier developed the genre known as &quot; magic realism &quot; before &quot; One Hundred Years of solitude , &quot; Garcia Marquez &apos;s first masterpiece , was published in June 1967 . 
the book is arguably Latin America &apos;s most famous work of fiction , however , and it has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into 36 languages . 
asked about death in an interview last month with an old friend , Jose font Castro , Garcia Marquez said : &quot; It anguishes me that it may be something permanent . 
&quot; He also said he would give up the Nobel Prize he won in 1982 , and just about everything else , if he could only be 50 again . 
asked why , he said &quot; to start all over again .
