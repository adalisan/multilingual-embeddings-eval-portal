the prices of U.S. Treasury securities closed narrowly range bound on Wednesday following a day of choppy trade . 
early in the session a durable goods report reversed some minor losses , as it was in line with market expectations . 
however , a mediocre two-year note auction later weighed on the market and the gains were erased . 
few expect significant price movement before the nonfarm payrolls report on June 6 , though volume was very high -- especially in the two-year sector , GovPX said . 
the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-making arm next meets on July 1 and 2 and a slew of data would have to be absorbed before then . 
fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated that he would favor further tightening of monetary policy if the economy continued to expand rapidly , even in the absence of overt inflationary statistics . 
the Fed voted to tighten short-term interest rates by 25 basis points at its meeting on March 25 and under Greenspan &apos;s tutelage has never moved only once to either tighten or ease policy . 
analysts said May retail sales and nonfarm payrolls would be critical as to whether the Fed moved in July . 
&quot; I think we &apos;re seeing a little relief here as the data we &apos;ve gotten this morning was a little to the weak side , &quot; said Richard Berner , executive vice president and chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. 
he said that while durable goods came in close to expectations -- rising 1.4 percent -- certain components of the report showed weakness . 
in addition , he pointed out that durable goods were notoriously volatile . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of information to come out before the next FOMC meeting . 
the economy would have to turn decisively stronger or inflation higher &quot; for the Fed to move , he said . 
bonds were still benefitting from the lingering effects of the strong dollar and overseas bond markets were coming back a little , Berner said . 
he expected the price defusion index in Monday &apos;s NAPM report to be benign , meaning participants in overseas -- especially European bonds -- would come back to treasuries despite strong economic fundamentals in the U.S. 
&quot; I &apos;m a bit surprised the market traded as well as it did in the face of strong orders given that we had auto and Goodyear workers striking , &quot; said Michael Strauss , chief economist at Sanwa Securities ( USA ) Co . 
however , as the session wore on investors &apos; fear of growing inflation began to resurface and gains seen earlier in the session evaporated . 
Strauss said the German government &apos;s plan to revaluate its gold supply despite Bundesbank opposition had small effect on U.S. trading . 
&quot; They &apos;re doing the equivalent of the voodoo budget games we do . 
it would just artificially improve their budget numbers , &quot; Strauss said . 
if Germany gets away with its plan , Spain and Italy also would have to be allowed the same leeway -- leading to a watered-down EMU , he said . 
the Treasury &apos;s 30-year bond ended unchanged at 94-31 / 32 to yield 7.03 percent . 
the 10-year closed down 1 / 32 at 98-25 / 32 to yield 6.80 percent . 
the five-year note was down 2 / 32 at 99-29 / 32 to yield 6.65 percent . 
the two-year ended down 1 / 32 at 100-4 / 32 to yield 6.30 percent . 
at the short end of the maturity spectrum the three-month bill ended three basis points lower at 5.01 percent . 
the six-month closed one basis point lower at 5.25 percent and the year bill was up one basis point at 5.55 percent .
