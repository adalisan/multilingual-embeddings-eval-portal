the head of Poland &apos;s ruling ex-communists on Monday proposed a nationwide referendum on the abortion at the same time as parliamentary elections this year . 
&quot; It would be sensible to hold it with the parliamentary elections , because at some stage we will have to resolve this issue , &quot; social democrat Jozef Oleksy told private Radio Zet . 
the abortion issue divides Poland into almost equal camps and is especially controversial now , as Pope John Paul , who views abortion as killing , is on a visit to his homeland . 
the ruling Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) , in which Oleksy heads the core party , and other liberal or leftist groups in parliament last year eased the previous anti-abortion law . 
last week Poland &apos;s Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the new law , allowing abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy for women who cannot afford a child or have personal problems , clashed with constitutional guarantees of the right to life . 
this means parliament must tighten the law again within six months , unless supporters of easier abortion can muster the two-thirds of votes needed to overturn the tribunal ruling -- which is unlikely in this parliament or the next . 
the ex-communists , calling the tribunal ruling politically-inspired , want a referendum which the Church and its allies say moral questions cannot be settled this way . 
holding the vote alongside elections might lead to wider participation than in a May 25 referendum on a new constitution , which passed narrowly but with less than 40 percent participation by voters . 
campaigning for the elections pits the ex-communists against Solidarity Election Action ( AWS ) , a pro-Church alliance of rightist parties led by the Solidarity trade union . 
the two groupings are competing for the lead in opinion polls , each with backing of between 20 and 30 percent . 
if adopted , the referendum suggestion could increase the profile of religious issues in the election campaign . 
Oleksy said it was up to the Church whether the polls appeared to be a fight between itself and the political left . 
the Church enjoyed great authority among Poles as a champion of human rights during the communist era , but many Poles believe it now seeks too much influence on public life . 
some of the ex-communists set out to appeal to voters with strongly secular views while others , including President Aleksander Kwasniewski , say they want to lower tensions over such issues .
