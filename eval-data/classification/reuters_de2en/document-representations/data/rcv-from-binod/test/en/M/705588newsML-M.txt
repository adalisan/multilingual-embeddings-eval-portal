wall Street &apos;s opening direction Thursday depends on whether U.S. employment data for June show signs of a significantly tighter Labor market and wage inflation , analysts said . 
the figures , due at 0830 EDT / 1230 GMT , are the final hurdle for financial markets this week , before a three-day holiday weekend in the United States . 
independence Day holiday . 
&quot; The ( stock ) market will focus on the key economic number this month -- employment , &quot; said Peter Cardillo , director of research at Westfalia Investments . 
stocks and bonds are seen opening higher if the employment data come in within the range of forecasts , but markets could suffer if the data point to a lower jobless rate , higher wages and inflation , analysts said . 
analysts expect non-farm payrolls to rise by around 222,000 , after an increase of 138,000 in May . 
the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.8 percent , and average hourly earnings are seen rising by 0.4 percent . 
ahead of the report , the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 futures index was off 0.25 point at 915.25 , while the long bond was up 3 / 32 at a 6.70 percent yield . 
on Wednesday , U.S. stocks roared higher after Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged . 
the Dow Jones Industrial average rose 73.05 points to 7795.38 . 
&quot; If the employment data come in significantly above expectations today , expect to see the market sell off , &quot; said Hildegard Zagorski , an analyst at prudential Securities . 
average hourly earnings will receive the most attention , according to Cardillo . 
&quot; Wages are the key , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If they rise by more than 0.3 percent or 0.4 percent , the bond market could get hit and stocks should see pressure . 
but analysts said volume would quickly thin out as traders left for the long weekend . 
&quot; We might not see the real fireworks in the market until Monday , &quot; Cardillo said .
