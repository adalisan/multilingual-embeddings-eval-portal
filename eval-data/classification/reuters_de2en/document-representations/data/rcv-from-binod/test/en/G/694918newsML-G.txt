cleaners put Hong Kong police on alert after leaving tins of an unidentified liquid near the site where Britain &apos;s Prince Charles will hand over the territory to Chinese President Jiang Zemin later on Monday . 
smoke billowed out after police opened five of seven tins they found late on Sunday night beside a flower bed near the heavily guarded Convention Centre , police said on Monday . 
a government chemist summoned to the scene quickly put a name to the smoking liquid -- hydrochloric acid . 
police said they believe the acid , used for cleaning , had been left behind by workers at the Convention Centre . 
more than 4,000 VIPs are due to crowd into the Grand Hall to witness the ceremony at midnight ( 1600 GMT ) marking the British territory &apos;s reversion to Chinese rule .
