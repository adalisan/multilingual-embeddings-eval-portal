emerging debt prices were higher in late New York trade as yield spreads continued to narrow against U.S. treasuries , said emerging market sources . 
&quot; Its all been tightening , &quot; said one emerging market fund manager at a major U.S. bank who did not want to be identified . 
&quot; Over the long-term , I think the market is going to do much better . 
I am not sure it ( spread tightening ) is going to stop any time soon . 
the biggest gainer of the Latin Bradys were Venezuelan FLIRBS which rose 3 / 4 to 92-1 / 2 bid . 
emerging market sources said Venezuelan debt rose in advance of a meeting Venezuelan Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar is expected to have with bankers here Wednesday . 
&quot; He ( Matos ) is here to talk with bankers about various financing mechanisms to reduce the country &apos;s debt burden so the market is taking that to mean some sort of Mexico-type exchange program by which Venezuela would issue a Eurobond and use the proceeds to retire some of the pars or discount bonds , &quot; said an emerging market analyst . 
Venezuelan pars firmed 3 / 8 to 79-3 / 4 and the country &apos;s DCBs rose 3 / 8 to 91-3 / 4 bid . 
Peru &apos;s when-issued PDI bonds rose 1 / 4 to 67 bid on news the IADB ( Inter-American Development Bank ) signed a $ 235.5 million loan for Peru as part of an $ 800 million dollar package to help the country restructure its external debt . 
market experts said the IADB loan had likely reduced some of the deal risk on the closing of Peru &apos;s Brady plan . 
&quot; One of the concerns the market may have had about the closing date of March 7 is that the multilateral funds to help finance that closing had not been fully approved by the multilaterals . 
it may have reduced some of the perceived deal risk with this news , &quot; said Marco Santamaria , emerging market economist at ING Barings in New York . 
in the broader Latin market , emerging market traders said prices were up across the board with spread tightening of five to 10 basis points . 
Argentine FRBs were 1 / 4 better at 92-1 / 4 bid , Brazilian &quot; C &quot; bonds were 5 / 8 higher at 82-1 / 4 bid and Mexican discount bonds were 1 / 4 firmer at 92-7 / 8 bid . 
&quot; The market was very reasonably bid . 
on every dip , there were buyers , &quot; said one emerging market debt trader at a European Bank based in New York . 
among Eastern European instruments , Russian loans posted the biggest gains despite news that the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) had delayed its recommendation to release a new tranche of its $ 10 billion loan to Russia . 
Vnesheconombank dollar loans rose 1-3 / 8 to 86-3 / 8 bid . 
elsewhere , Bulgarian paper continued to post gains and sources said they expect that trend to continue . 
the country &apos;s IABs firmed 3 / 8 to 62-3 / 8 bid . 
the fund manager at the U.S. bank said he believed Bulgarian debt instruments would continue to enjoy strong returns over the longer-term . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be bumpy but I think it &apos;s going to be a long ride .
