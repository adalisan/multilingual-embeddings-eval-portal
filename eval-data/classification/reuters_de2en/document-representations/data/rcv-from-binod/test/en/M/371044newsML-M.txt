Taiwan &apos;s money rates fell at midday on Tuesday as cash demand eased after the five-day Chinese lunar new year holiday , dealers said . 
the overnight interbank rate was at 6.293 percent against Wednesday &apos;s 6.718 close , with 30-day commercial paper at 5.75-6.00 against 6.00-6.25 . 
dealers expected the money rates to test their lower levels in the near term as liquidity would gradually return to the banking system . 
the government bond yields were down , with the 10-year 86 / 4 bond yield was at 6.048-6.049 and the 15-year construction bond yield at 6.225 .
