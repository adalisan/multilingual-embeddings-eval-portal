four leftist guerrillas and a soldier died in clashes in northwest Colombia on Tuesday , military sources said . 
four insurgents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , the country &apos;s largest rebel army , were killed near the town of Mutata , in the conflict-torn banana-growing region of Uraba . 
in a separate clash in Yondo , a rural area of northwestern Antioquia province , one soldier died and four were wounded in firefights with the FARC . 
the latest deaths came against the background of what military experts described as the bloodiest guerrilla offensive in decades -- which began with a rebel raid on a military barracks in southern Putumayo province on August 30 . 
at least 27 soldiers died in that attack and another 60 were taken prisoner . 
these are still being held by FARC rebels pending agreement between the guerrilla force , intermediaries and the government on the terms of their release .
