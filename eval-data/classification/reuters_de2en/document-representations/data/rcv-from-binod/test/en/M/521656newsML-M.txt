Rotterdam fuel oil bunkers were slightly firmer on Friday amid healthy trade , while Mediterranean bunkers sagged , dealers said . 
Rotterdam was about $ 1 a tonne firmer at around $ 84 fob as the barge market strengthened . 
dealers said the barge gains were the result of tightness of supply until early next week as well as the efforts of one trading house to support prices . 
some traders said the enquiry level was as high as 25,000 tonnes . 
Hamburg prices were slightly higher in line with Rotterdam gains and marginally tighter supply . 
business was calm after a fairly hectic Thursday . 
Mediterranean fuel oil was steady or down $ 1 as underlying cargo quotes dipped . 
Fujairah prices were stable . 
Durban was also barely changed . 
dealers said fuel oil was still in short supply until the start of next week .
