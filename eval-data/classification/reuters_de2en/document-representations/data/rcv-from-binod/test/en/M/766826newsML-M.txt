Germany &apos;s IBIS DAX index ended the day at a record closing high on Wednesday , with sentiment during share dealings boosted by early advances on Wall Street and the ongoing strength of the dollar .

&quot; The fundamentals right now are actually very good to keep on posting gains but the buy orders are lacking at the moment , &quot; said one Frankfurt dealer .

Deutsche Bank AG ended the day nearly four percent higher at 124.75 marks , a rise of 4.55 marks . 
dealers said that the share benefited from an analysts &apos; meeting in London . 
&quot; The meeting seems to be over and the orders are coming in , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The entire board with Rolf Breuer at the head presented themselves very well to the investment community , &quot; he said . 
BHF-Bank AG said on Wednesday it expected to post a satisfactory overall profit for 1997 after group pre-tax profit rose 10.4 percent to 181 million marks in the first six months . 
shares in BHF , considered a top takeover target , ended down 70 pfennigs at 58.30 marks even though some dealers said the results were generally in line with market expectations .

Dresdner Bank AG fell on profit-taking over the day , but pared losses to end the day up 98 pfennigs at 84.80 marks .

&quot; The whole sector is up on speculation for more deals , &quot; said one trader . 
among other shares , carmaker Volkswagen AG ended up 33.40 marks at 1,384.45 marks after saying in recent days that it was adding extra shifts at some VW and Audi factories due to high demand for models .
