former winner Jim courier &apos;s Italian Open hopes took a dive on Sunday after he drew top seed Pete Sampras in the opening round but champion Thomas muster &apos;s prospects of progressing perked up . 
muster , seeking his third title in a row and fourth in all , drew Italian wild card Marzio Martelli for the first round of the open which begins on Monday . 
after a succession of early exits on his favourite surface , Austria &apos;s one-time &apos; King of clay &apos; should at least get through his opening match at the Foro Italico . 
world number three muster , who compiled an extraordinary 111-5 win-loss record on clay between 1995 and 1996 , is looking surprisingly out of sorts on the red surface . 
at the prestigious Barcelona , Monte Carlo and Hamburg tournaments , the 29-year-old muster suffered first-round defeats to players ranked far below him . 
ironically , muster started the clay-court season fresh from one of his best-ever performances on hardcourts , including victory at Key Biscayne . 
the field in Rome is the best in years with 17 of the world &apos;s top 20 players in the draw and all eager to hone their game for the French Open which starts on May 26 . 
second seed Michael Chang , in the same half as muster , drew Argentine Hernan Gumy for his first match . 
Chang won the U.S. clay-court championship in Orlando last month although he comes to Rome fresh from a first-round upset in the American red clay-court championships at coral springs . 
Sampras will be looking to boost his morale ahead of Roland Garros , after a humiliating first-round defeat in Monte Carlo to Swede Magnus Larsson -- also in his half of the draw -- in his only appearance on the European clay circuit this season . 
his friend courier will do his best to block him . 
Germany &apos;s Boris Becker -- the man Sampras defeated in the 1994 Rome final -- makes a welcome return to the Eternal City in his continuing quest to fill the one outstanding blank on an otherwise perfect career record : a clay-court title . 
he opens against Italian wild card Andrea Gaudenzi . 
Russia &apos;s reigning French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov takes on Spain &apos;s Javier Sanchez . 
among the serve-and-volley specialists bidding for a rare triumph on clay are Croat Goran Ivanisevic , who drew Australia &apos;s Mark Woodforde , and reigning Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek , runner-up a year ago . 
Krajicek compounded a miserable draw for the hosts by getting Italian wild card Diego Nargiso as his first opponent . 
should the once all-conquering muster abdicate his Roman throne , there are also a host of young pretenders ready to battle for succession . 
world number seven Marcelo Rios of Chile served warning of his clay-court potential last month with an impressive victory at Monte Carlo while number 11 seed Alberto Costa heads a pack of clay specialists from Spain . 
Costa won in Barcelona in April when all four semifinalists were Spaniards , the others being beaten Australian Open finalist Carlos Moya , Alex Corretja and Felix Mantilla . 
Britain &apos;s Tim Henman , the 14th seed , had one of the better draws , facing Spain &apos;s Roberto Carretero first and then a qualifier .
