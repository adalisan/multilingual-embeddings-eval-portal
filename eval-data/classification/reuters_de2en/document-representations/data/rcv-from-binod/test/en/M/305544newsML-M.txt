Colombian stocks leaped to new highs Tuesday -- continuing the trend that began at the start of the year -- unphased by government announcements on economic emergency measures . 
local and foreign investors scrambled for bluechips , pushing Bogota &apos;s IBB index up 3.67 percent to 1,041.13 , its highest level since May 10 , 1994 , and sending Medellin &apos;s IBOMED index skyrocketing 6.25 percent to 16,212.58 , its highest since July 25 , 1995 . 
Bogota saw a 4.2 billion peso volume while the day &apos;s trade in Medellin totalled 10.9 billion pesos . 
the economic emergency , decreed Monday by President Ernesto Samper to combat the yawning fiscal deficit , had no impact on investor sentiment and brokers believe in the medium term the crisis measures announced could inject fresh dynamism into the markets . 
&quot; The economic emergency has not had the slightest impact on trading . 
local and foreign investors knew there was a problem and knew something like this may happen , &quot; a Bogota broker said . 
the Bogota stock exchange has gained more than 25 percent in the year so far , compared to just 11.8 percent in the whole of 1996 . 
Medellin has so far gained 20.77 percent this year compared to a 3 percent loss last year . 
the main mover on the Bogota exchange was cement manufacturer Cementos Caribe , up 21 percent at 5,100 . 
brewing giant Bavaria rose 8.75 percent to 6,199 and Banco gandero ordinary shares increased 4.66 percent to 314 pesos each . 
the main mover in Medellin was Banco Ganadero preferential shares , up 26.66 percent to 250 pesos . 
cement manufacturer Cementos Del Valle gained 21 percent , closing at 4,719 , while Cementos Caribe ended up 18.16 percent at 5,400 . 
one broker said the new emergency measures announced Monday to tax those private and public sector companies contracting new foreign debt could in fact stimulate the stock market by forcing companies to issue new shares to raise funds in Colombia . 
demand continued to be driven by the perception that Colombian stocks are undervalued and by the new tax on fixed income , which ranges from 1 percent to 7 percent depending on the maturity of the bond .
