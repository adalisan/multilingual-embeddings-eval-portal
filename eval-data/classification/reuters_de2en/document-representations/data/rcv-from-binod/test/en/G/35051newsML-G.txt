the United States reserved the right to strike Iraq again if Baghdad tried to re-build air defences disabled by cruise missiles this week , Defence Secretary William Perry said on Thursday night . 
&quot; The reason for those cruise missile strikes were to disable the air defence systems so our pilots could have a safer flight over the no-fly zone , &quot; he said in an interview on CNN . 
&quot; That has been successful . 
but if the Iraqis were to try to reconstitute that air defence site , particulary in light of their statement they are not going to honour the no flight zone , then we would have to reconsider . 
U.S. aircraft , ships and a submarine launched back-to-back cruise missile strikes against military targets in southern Iraq on Tuesday and Wednesday before Washington imposed an expanded flight-exclusion zone on the south . 
&quot; We are reserving the right to go back again if we need to go back again , &quot; Perry said . 
&quot; That would depend very much on the Iraqi reaction . 
if they threaten our airplanes they will be inviting additional problems . 
citing U.S. intelligence , Perry said President Saddam Hussein was pulling back mechanized and armoured forces that had driven into a Western-protected safe haven for ethnic Kurds , prompting the U.S. military strikes . 
&quot; So that &apos;s good news , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We think they still have security forces in ( the Kurdish-populated northern city ) Arbil , secret police , infantry forces . 
the main thrust of their army , the mechanized forces and artillery , have pulled back and is heading back south , heading back to the barracks .
