U.S. anti-drug chief Barry McCaffrey said on Tuesday cocaine producers would have to look for new markets because within a decade the United States would stop being a major consumer of the drug . 
&quot; cocaine producers will soon be looking for a new market . 
it could be Brazil , Poland or Hong Kong but not the United States . 
ten years from now the United States will not be a major cocaine consumer , &quot; McCaffrey told Reuters during a visit to Peru to evaluate the country &apos;s anti-drug efforts . 
McCaffrey said the fact that U.S. drug consumers were increasingly abandoning cocaine for &quot; different manufactured drugs &quot; would reduce producers &apos; profits as the drug would become cheaper on world markets . 
U.S. consumers spend $ 49 billion annually on illegal drugs , half the amount spent only a few years ago , he added . 
the drug Czar made his comments as he tried to inspect U.S.-funded alternative crop programmes in Peru &apos;s lush River Apurimac valley . 
accompanied by President Alberto Fujimori he flew over the jungle region where the government is encouraging local farmers to substitute fields of coca , the raw product for cocaine , for other products like cocoa , coffee , cotton and corn . 
Peru , whose economy receives around $ 400 million each year from the illegal drugs trade , is the world &apos;s largest grower of coca leaf , accounting for 50 percent of total production , Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila said . 
McCaffrey could not inspect the projects due to thick cloud in the low-lying jungle area and was forced to fly back to the highland city of Ayacucho , 360 miles ( 575 km ) east of Lima . 
another attempt to visit the Apurimac projects was scheduled for Wednesday . 
McCaffrey , a former commander-in-chief of the United States Southern Command , arrived in Peru late on Monday for what he termed &quot; a purely fact-finding visit &quot; from Panama and was due to return to the United States late on Wednesday .
