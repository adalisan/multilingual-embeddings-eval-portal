a Florida appeals court has upheld the conviction of a Miami Herald reporter for refusing to answer questions about a jailhouse interview with a suspected child murderer , the newspaper said Thursday . 
reporter David Kidwell spent 15 days in prison in October and faces another 55 days behind bars in connection with an interview with John Zile , who was charged with first-degree murder for the 1994 beating death of Christina Holt , his 7-year-old stepdaughter . 
the Fourth District Court of Appeal on Wednesday rejected Kidwell &apos;s claim that published and unpublished information he gathered during the interview was protected by the Constitution &apos;s guarantee of freedom of the press . 
sandy Bohrer , Kidwell &apos;s attorney , said he would immediately appeal to the Florida Supreme Court . 
Kidwell will stay out of prison pending the outcome of that appeal . 
Pauline Zile , the girl &apos;s mother and Zile &apos;s wife , was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison for standing by as Zile allegedly beat and suffocated the child . 
the couple told police the girl had been kidnapped from a Fort Lauderdale flea market , but police suspected a hoax and John Zile eventually led them to Christina &apos;s battered body , buried behind a local shopping center . 
prosecutors had wanted Kidwell to verify the substance of his article , which included incriminating statements by Zile , for use in Zile &apos;s trial . 
Zile was convicted in November and sentenced to life in prison without the information . 
the Miami Herald , owned by Knight-Ridder Inc , said its attorneys and editors had fought legal battles on Kidwell &apos;s behalf but ultimately advised him to answer questions about the interview and the story .
