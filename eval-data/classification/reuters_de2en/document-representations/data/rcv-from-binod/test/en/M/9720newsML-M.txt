the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) left its key discount rate steady on Thursday but analysts said news of its latest additions to the money market show it is willing to steer a slightly easier monetary course for now . 
such action is expected to continue as long as the Swiss franc stays strong , and the Swiss economy remains weak . 
the SNB said on Thursday , as expected , it was keeping its discount rate at 1.50 percent . 
but it also said in the afternoon that it was adding a &quot; significant quantity &quot; of liquidity to the Swiss money market . 
&quot; lowering the discount rate would not have had much impact on the economy . 
with this operation , effectively the SNB can influence the exchange rates . 
they are not going straight forward , but it can be interpreted as certain type of easing , especially in relation to the currencies , &quot; said Peter Jeggli , bond research analyst at CS Research , a division of Credit Suisse .
