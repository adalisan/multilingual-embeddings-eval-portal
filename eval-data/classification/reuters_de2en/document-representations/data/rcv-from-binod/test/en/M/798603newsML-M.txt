Zimbabwean shares retreated from their overnight peak on Thursday with brokers saying many market players were holding onto their cash for the public issue of a state-owned bank which opened last Thursday . 
the main industrial index dropped 57.51 points to close at 12,001.03 on the back of losses on some key counters . 
&quot; The market was a bit on the retreating side because many people are trying to hold onto their money for the CBZ ( Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe ) issue , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; I think the market will continue on a downward slope because the CBZ issue is quite a big pocket , &quot; he added . 
the government is selling 80 percent of its shares in the CBZ as part of its state privatisation programme . 
the offer of 320 million shares at Z $ 1.60 each is aimed at raising Z $ 512 million which would be used to recapitalise the bank to comply with central Reserve Bank capital adequacy requirements . 
it closes on August 29 after which the shares will trade over the counter before shareholders decide next April whether to list on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange . 
on the exchange on Thursday , merchant bank NMB dropped 50 cents to 3,500 as did tea and coffee producer EHPL to 250 , tyre-maker Dunlop shed 40 cents to 140 while pharmaceutical group caps lost 30 cents to 420 . 
blue-chip hotels and supermarkets conglomerate Delta and industrial investor TZI each traded 25 cents lower at 2,125 and 900 respectively . 
against the trend , publishers Zimpapers added 12 cents to 182 with 1.8 million shares changing hands while clothing retailer Truworths put on 20 cents to 750 and cable manufacturer BICAF rose 50 cents to 300 . 
in minings , gold counters closed lower across the board with brokers saying &quot; the sad story continues with the gold price still very low &quot; . 
gold investor Falgold eased five cents to 75 while Bindura saw a 25 cents in offer price to 525 with no trades registered on the back of what brokers said were unexciting interim results . 
the mining index edged 2.53 points lower to end at 923.54 .
