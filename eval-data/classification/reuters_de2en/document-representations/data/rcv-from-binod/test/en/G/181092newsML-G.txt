the ugly break-up of a conference on East Timor shows Malaysia will not tolerate criticism of sensitive issues affecting its neighbours , even at the risk of embarrassing itself , analysts said on Monday . 
Jomo Sundaram , a University of Malaya political scientist and one of a group of conference participants arrested after the meeting , said the incident was an embarrassment for the country . 
he said the Malaysian government should &quot; recognise , respect and protect the rights of Malaysians and others to maintain and express dissenting views &quot; . 
a mob comprising members of youth groups allied to the government barged into the conference of Malaysian and foreign non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) on Saturday , shoving people aside , overturning furniture , ripping banners down and shouting at the participants , witnesses said . 
it was a shocking sight in a country whose culture puts great emphasis on courtesy and non-confrontation and where such scenes are a rarity . 
after the near-riot at a central Kuala Lumpur hotel , Malaysian officials said that while they did not know the youths were going to disrupt the conference , they endorsed the action . 
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said last week the Cabinet had demanded APCET II be called off , saying it would harm ties with Indonesia . 
the newly-elected chairman of the youth wing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad &apos;s United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told the national news agency Bernama it was he who ordered the youths to disrupt the conference . 
&quot; Public order and our good relations with Indonesia are more important , &quot; Anwar said on Sunday when asked if Malaysia &apos;s image had been tarnished by the incident . 
the United Nations recognises Lisbon as its administering power . 
Conference organiser Sanusi Osman said the meeting would have proposed that the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) mediate the dispute -- a quixotic idea given the group &apos;s aversion to interfering in the affairs of its neighbours . 
Jomo said the youth group &apos;s action undermined the prime minister &apos;s goal of becoming a developed country by the year 2020 , &quot; as well as any sense of Asian values &quot; . 
diplomats said it appeared the government had both tired of non-government groups and was keen to signal it would not tolerate criticism of what it regarded as the internal affairs of a neighbour . 
&quot; The government is clearly sending a signal to the Malaysian NGOs , &quot; said an Asian diplomat . 
Malaysian activists have been strident about a range of issues recently , from the controversial Bakun dam in a Borneo rainforest to mistreatment of foreign workers in immigration camps and other human rights issues . 
Malaysia and other members of ASEAN have been pressured by Western governments and human rights groups to take a stand against repression of democracy in Burma . 
but ASEAN -- grouping Malaysia , Indonesia , Brunei the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam -- has steadfastly resisted , saying a founding principle of the group is to avoid criticising each other &apos;s domestic policies .
