Manila stocks are expected to suffer declines next week on follow-through selling , induced by the sharp fall of the Philippine National Bank ( PNB ) on Friday , analysts said . 
&quot; PNB was a shocker and next week we will still see its negative aftershocks . 
there &apos;s always Halloween before Christmas and we are now dealing with the spooks , &quot; said Joey Salceda , president of SBC Warburg . 
PNB &apos;s early fall on Friday fuelled negative sentiment causing other frontliners such as San Miguel Corp and Petron Corp to tumble . 
PNB closed 87.50 pesos , or 21.34 percent , lower at 322.50 pesos on news that it posted a mere four percent increase in net profits at 993 million pesos . 
Manila shares have been submerged in negative territory since Monday as the market was in a consolidation mode , analysts said . 
investors would take refuge in thirdliners next week while waiting for blue chips to shed further , said Noel Reyes , research head at Anscor Hagedorn Securities Inc . 
&quot; It &apos;s a good time to buy and focus will be on speculatives and certain secondliners with stories to tell , &quot; Reyes added . 
immediate support level is seen at 2,950 points , he said . 
the main index slid 137.13 points , or 4.62 percent , to 2,962.60 points on Friday versus the week-ago level of 3,099.73 points .
