mark McNulty coasted to his fourth tournament win in five starts with a comfortable nine-shot victory in the Wild Coast Challenge on Sunday . 
the Zimbabwean compiled a superb four-under-par 66 -- he finished with three successive birdies -- for a 10-under-par total of 270 . 
&quot; My caddy Basil ( van Rooyen ) said to me on the second tee we should set a target for the day and I said I would try to shoot 66 . 
&quot; And getting birdies on each of my last three holes was a pleasant bonus -- I just wish I could take my all-round game , as it is at the moment , to this year &apos;s U.S. 
open . 
four shots ahead entering the final round , McNulty dropped just one shot . 
he bogeyed the eighth , played into a brisk south-westerly wind . 
he never allowed his nearest rivals to close the gap , and , with a back nine of 32 , opened up one of the largest victory margins he could remember in his professional career . 
South African Justin Hobday ( 67 ) holed out from a greenside bunker for a birdie three at the last to finish second on 279 .
