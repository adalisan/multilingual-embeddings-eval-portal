an Ethiopian court on Friday sentenced three Egyptians to death for attempting to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa last year , the official Ethiopian News Agency ( ENA ) reported . 
Mubarak escaped unhurt after Egyptian Moslem militants opened fire on his motorcade as he was on his way to an Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) summit in the Ethiopian capital on June 26 , 1995 . 
the agency said the three men sentenced to death were members of Egypt &apos;s Al-Gama &apos;a Al-Islamiya ( Islamic Group ) , which is fighting to set up an Islamic state in Egypt . 
the prosecutor told the court that the three gunmen used false names and carried Yemeni , Sudanese and Ethiopian passports to enter Ethiopia in 1995 after receiving military training at a clandestine camp in Afghanistan , the agency reported . 
Ethiopia has said that 11 members of Al-Gama &apos;a were involved in the plot to kill Mubarak , with two of the men directing the failed operation from neighbouring Sudan . 
Egypt also accused Sudan of helping the gunmen and sheltering three of them after the attack , which Sudan denied . 
three other gunmen were apprehended in Ethiopia and five more were killed . 
the state-run news agency , quoting a spokesman for the Central High Court of Ethiopia , said the three were also found guilty of killing two policemen , wounding seven civilans and smuggling arms into the country . 
the trial was held in camera . 
Ethiopia &apos;s president must approve the sentences before they are carried out , the agency said . 
the United Nations Security Council last May imposed diplomatic sanctions on Sudan to pressure Khartoum into handing over the three suspects said to be there .
