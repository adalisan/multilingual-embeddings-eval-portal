traders bid via France to export a total of 692,050 tonnes of free market soft wheat at subsidies ranging from 4.37 to 11.37 Ecus per tonne . 
bids for the lowest subsidy would value French wheat for early November shipment at around $ 172 per tonne on world markets , they said . 
traders also asked to export 359,300 tonnes of free market EU barley at subsidies ranging from 28.80 to 36.65 Ecus per tonne . 
the cheapest of these would value prompt October barley at around $ 139 per tonne , fob France . 
the full breakdown of the barley bids was not immediately available but sources said they included demands to export up to 155,000 tonnes at a refund of 32.00 Ecus per tonne and up to 158,000 at a refund of 33.00 . 
they also said bids for wheat at a subsidy of around 6.00 Ecus per tonne and for barley at a subsidy of some 33.00 Ecus stood the best chance to be cleared by the European Commission .
