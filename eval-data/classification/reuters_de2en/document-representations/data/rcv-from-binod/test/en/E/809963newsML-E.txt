builders broke ground on new homes and apartments at the same rate in July as in June , the Commerce Department said Tuesday , as construction showed signs of leveling off from a boom pace earlier in the year . 
total starts in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.447 million , unchanged from June when starts increased a revised 3.2 percent from May . 
wall Street analysts had forecast a slightly stronger 1.46-million-unit building pace for July . 
the only region where starts increased in July was the Northeast . 
starts there jumped 41.4 percent to a rate of 157,000 a year , the strongest monthly gain since a 41.9 percent increase in November 1994 . 
but in the Midwest building rates were down 3.7 percent to 289,000 , in the South they fell 2.4 percent to 663,000 and in the West they fell 5.3 percent to 338,000 a year . 
a moderating housing market might provide the Federal Reserve &apos;s policysetting Federal Open Market Committee with additional reasons to hold interest rates steady at a session on Tuesday . 
New-home building touched a peak rate of 1.554 million units a year in February , amid exceptionally mild weather that fostered building activity . 
analysts say favorable mortgage rates and brisk job creation will support housing markets throughout the year , though unlikely at the robust sales or building clips reached in the first quarter .
