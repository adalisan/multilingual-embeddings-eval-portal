the European Parliament on Tuesday elected Spanish Partido Popular member Jose-Maria Gil-Robles Gil Delgado as its new president to replace German Socialist Klaus Haensch . 
his election , by 338 votes to 177 for his only contender , France &apos;s Catherine Lalumiere , who won a surprisingly large protest vote , came as no surprise after a deal between the EU assembly &apos;s two biggest political groups . 
Gil-Robles &apos; first words after taking the chair included thanks to Lalumiere , who he said had increased her standing by standing in protest against the carve-up of the presidency . 
&quot; I think the votes she gained have only increased her prestige in this house , &quot; he said of the leader of the Parliament &apos;s alternative European Radical Alliance group . 
under a long-standing deal the Socialists and mainly Christian Democrat European People &apos;s Party share the presidency of the parliament &apos;s five-year legislature .
