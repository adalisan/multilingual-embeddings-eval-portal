the National Bank of Slovakia ( NBS ) said on Monday it had drained funds totalling 2.5 billion crowns ( $ 89.8 million ) through two securities reverse repurchase tenders . 
in the NBS &apos;s one-day reverse repo tender , the average rate rose to 16.32 percent , after 13.98 percent in the previous reverse repo tender of a similar maturity . 
in the central bank &apos;s three-day reverse repo tender , the average rate firmed to 16.42 percent from 14.8 percent in the previous three-day reverse repo tender . 
the NBS added the one-day tender was oversubscribed , with 1.7 billion crowns worth of bids from a total of 2.1 billion being accepted , while all bids for the three-day tender totalling 800 million crowns were accepted . 
the NBS holds tenders on a daily basis , if needed , instead of quoting securities repo and reverse repo rates .
