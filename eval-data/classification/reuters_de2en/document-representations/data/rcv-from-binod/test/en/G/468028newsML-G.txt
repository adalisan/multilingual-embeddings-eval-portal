Gulf Arab foreign ministers will on Tuesday discuss their strained ties with Iran following a tour of the six states by Iran &apos;s foreign minister , an official was on Tuesday quoted as saying . 
Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) Secretary-General , Jameel al-Hejailan , said the meeting in Riyadh would also discuss the faltering Middle East peace process and Israel &apos;s plans to build a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem . 
the GCC alliance groups Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Oman , Bahrain , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . 
Hejailan told the Saudi daily Okaz the ministers would discuss ... &quot; developments in their relations with Iran in the light of the tour by Iran &apos;s Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati which we hope will lead to positive results and help ( achieve ) relations of trust ... &quot; . 
a Gulf official told Reuters the ministers would exchange views and information on what was discussed with Velayati in each country during his tour . 
Velayati said his tour of the six states last week had opened a new chapter in relations between Iran and its Arab neighbours across the Gulf . 
the official Iranian news agency IRNA on Monday reported that Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah told Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani at talks on the sidelines of an Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) summit in Islamabad that he would personally attend the December OIC summit in Tehran . 
if confirmed the visit would be the first by such a senior Saudi official to Tehran in more than a decade of often tense relations between two of the world &apos;s largest oil exporters . 
Gulf Arab states accuse Iran of interfering in their internal affairs -- a charge Iran denies -- and have voiced concern over its arms buildup . 
Iran says its arms programme was only for defence purposes . 
another sore point in relations is a territorial dispute over three strategic islands between Iran and the UAE .
