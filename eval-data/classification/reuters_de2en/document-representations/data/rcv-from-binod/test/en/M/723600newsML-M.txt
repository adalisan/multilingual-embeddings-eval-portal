South African shares are set to firm next week , but the rollercoaster ride of the gold sector could still provide an upset despite recent strong gains , portfolio managers said on Friday . 
the gold index has suffered a topsy-turvy week of violent ups and downs as it responded to the vagaries of the international price of bullion . 
after shedding about five percent on Monday in the face of bullion &apos;s drop to around $ 315 an ounce , the local gold index chopped and changed before adding five percent on Thursday and posting strong gains on Friday as bullion recovered to $ 321 . 
but portfolio managers , pointing to relatively low volumes trading in the sector , warned that the gains of the last few days could easily evaporate if bullion suddenly sickened again . 
&quot; It all depends on the gold price ... we have never been fond of gold shares . 
we don &apos;t believe that the risk profile of gold shares adds any value , &quot; said Andre Joubert , a portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management . 
some buying has crept into the sector from speculators and institutions with a longer-term view on the gold price who are keen to build up stocks cheaply . 
but investors warn the bottom may not have been hit yet . 
&quot; It is far too premature to speculate about turning a corner or hitting bottom . 
there is still probably more downside then upside , &quot; said one portfolio manager , who declined to be named . 
gold started trading firmer in Europe on Friday , but analysts warned that there was strong selling resistance at $ 322 in a market that was still overwhelmingly bearish . 
if gold does take another knock next week it could spread negative sentiment into the broader market as the falling value of gold sets alarm bells ringing on marginal mine closures , job losses and reserve levels . 
but the underlying mood of South African shares is still positive as the market looks to interest rate cuts later in the year to loosen the pockets of South Africa &apos;s suffering consumers . 
this is in contrast to many major financial centres where interest rates are set to rise as shown on Thursday when Britain raised rates . 
a recent Reuters poll of economists showed a one-point cut in South African rates is a possibility by the end of the third quarter and a certainty by the end of the year . 
&quot; It is a matter of timing , not direction , as to a move in interest rates , &quot; Joubert said . 
the local market mood is also benefiting from the relatively painless July 1 relaxation of some exchange controls on individuals . 
a feared massive outflow of cash has not appeared and Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Thursday that only 25 million rand ( $ 5.5 million ) had been invested offshore so far . 
&quot; It is early days , but the relaxation of exchange controls has gone well , &quot; one portfolio manager said . 
there are no major economic indicators due next week , but on the corporate side Monday will see interim results from Chemical Services Ltd and Del Monte Royal Foods Ltd on Wednesday , followed by LTA Ltd on Thursday . 
analysts will be looking for any signs that the recent poor performance of South African companies is coming to a halt . 
however , they are unlikely to find comfort in Del Monte where tough trading conditions in European canned fruit and internal worries are likely to hit profits . 
two out of the 10 analysts polled by Reuters ranged Del Monte &apos;s earnings per share falling to between 15.5 cents and 19.89 cents from 22.1 cents in the first half of the previous year . 
the dividend was seen between five and a flat 7.5 cents .
