the U.N. Security Council late on Friday called on rebels in Zaire to declare a ceasefire in the eastern part of the country which has already been accepted by the Kinsasha government . 
the council , in a formal meeting , also for the first time referred to reports of massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees , mainly by Tutsi rebels and others . 
it noted &quot; with concern allegations of violations of international humantarian law . 
the council also welcomed the sending of a U.N. fact-finding mission . 
a U.N. mission , made up of three aid agencies , intends to leave Nairobi on Sunday for Tingi-Tingi in eastern Zaire to evaluate refugees needs but not probe alleged massacres , U.N. officials said . 
the rebels , known as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo , have rejected international pressure for a ceasefire and instead , confident of military victory , want a transitional government in Zaire and elections . 
the council called on the rebels &quot; to declare publicly their acceptance &quot; of a five-point U.N. peace plan devised by special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun , &quot; in particular an immediate cessation of hostilities . 
in addition to a ceasefire , the plan calls for withdrawal of all external forces , re-affirmination of respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and other states of the region , protection for all refugees and the eventual holding of an international conference . 
Tutsi-led rebels , who now control a large swathe of territory in eastern Zaire , took up arms in October , accusing the Zairean authorities of denying them citizenship and planning to expel them to Rwanda , their ancestral home . 
the council also urged all governments in the region to cooperate with Sahnoun , who is currently in New York . 
but it made no mention of any future sending of a monitor or troops . 
U.N. Secretary-General Annan , who attended the meeting , earlier on Friday spoke of a &quot; mechanism for monitoring a ceasefire , if it were to be agreed upon , and disengagement of the forces . 
&quot; In previous days he had advocated plans for soldiers to protect the refugees if all else failed . 
so far France appears to be the only major nation supporting a multinational force , which was organised by Canada late last year but then called off when many refugees began returning home . 
but the concept of a force also differs among various parties from what Annan apparently had in mind to protect refugees and relief workers . 
Zaire , which appears to be losing militarily in the east , wants &quot; international monitors &quot; to oversee a withdrawal of foreign troops and implementation of a U.N. peace plan that calls for a ceasefire and political negotiations . 
while more than a million Rwandan refugees have returned , up to 500,000 others are still in Zaire , many unaccounted for and others believed dead . 
among the refugees are members of the Hutu militia and former Rwandan government army responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide of more than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus . 
fearing revenge , the Hutus fled Rwanda to eastern Zaire after the Tutsis fought their way into power in 1994 .
