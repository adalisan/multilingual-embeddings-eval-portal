Russia plans to raise between two to three trillion roubles this year by selling some of the foreign debt owed to Moscow , First Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Part of the measures ( to increase budget revenues ) will be connected to the sales of some debts to us or their better management , &quot; Kudrin told a news conference . 
&quot; We are planning more talks with countries which either do not pay , or do not pay in full . 
Russia , which inherited responsibility for both the assets and the liabilities of the former Soviet Union , is owed about $ 132 billion , calculated at the former State Soviet Bank rate of about 0.60 roubles per dollar . 
it currently receives $ 1-2 billion annual in debt repayment , half of it in goods . 
Russia plans securitising some of the debt as one way to raise repayment . 
Russia is facing a severe financial crisis , which is forcing the government to cut planned spending by 105 trillion roubles this year . 
domestic tax revenues in the first quarter of thie year were only 49 percent of budgeted levels .
