scientists trying to identify what they believe are the bones of legendary revolutionary Ernesto &quot; Che &quot; Guevara said on Wednesday they needed a few more days for the final proof as debate raged over whether to keep the remains in Bolivia . 
former revolutionaries , an ex-right-wing dictator recently elected president and people who interested in attracting more tourists are arguing over what to do with the remains of Che , who has become part of left-wing mythology . 
some are worried they will not profit from the dead guerrilla any longer if his body is shipped back to his widow in Cuba . 
a skeleton believed to be Che &apos;s was taken from a mass grave in a mountain village on Sunday to a Japanese hospital in this east Bolivian city for final identification . 
scientists said they could make out Che &apos;s heavy features on the skull of the skeleton , code-named E-2 , but would not have the final proof for several days . 
Che and a ragged band of rebels trying to import Cuba &apos;s revolution onto the South American mainland were hunted down by Bolivian troops at Vallegrande in October 1967 . 
wounded and starving , Che was riddled with bullets by a soldier in a schoolroom and his body exhibited to photographers before it was dumped in a mass grave in a secret location . 
the troops also cut off Che &apos;s hands so the fingerprints would prove they had killed him . 
so when scientists found a skeleton with the hands missing last week they immediately suspected it was the legendary guerrilla &apos;s . 
while the scientists work on identification , debate is raging on what to do with Che &apos;s presumed remains . 
inhabitants of Vallegrande , where he was finally hunted down , were opposed to removing his bones , which had drawn tourists to the remote mountain village . 
they wanted to put his body in a mausoleum , which they reckoned would attract even more tourists . 
the people of Vallegrande defiantly said they would put up a memorial to Che and former President Jaime Paz Zamora said his bones should not leave the country . 
&quot; If Che chose Bolivia then why are we going to contradict his wishes after his death ? 
&quot; Paz Zamora asked . 
&quot; In the end he chose Bolivia knowing what he was doing , knowing that that meant he could die in Bolivia . 
he argued that if Che &apos;s bones were sent to Cuba , Bolivia would no longer be remembered as the guerrilla &apos;s last resting place but just the country whose troops killed him . 
Paz Zamora was once a fiery young radical who founded the Revolutionary Leftist Movement . 
his rebel brother Nestor was killed by security forces three years after they killed Che . 
but President-elect Hugo Banzer , a fierce anti-communist who was military dictator from 1971-78 , insists Che &apos;s family should get his bones . 
the current government has said it will let his family in Cuba decide where his remains should rest . 
Che was an asthmatic Argentine doctor who became one of the leaders of the Cuban revolution , fighting side-by-side with Fidel Castro . 
his hairy , charismatic face was most famously photographed by Alberto Korda in 1960 in an image since repeated on countless student posters and T-shirts . 
in communist Cuba , where Che became a citizen , was industry minister and had five children from two marriages , state shops today sell Che videos , T-shirts and baseball caps . 
but as a man of action , Che became dissatisfied with life as a Cuban minister . 
at the age of 38 , he slipped into Bolivia disguised as a priest , then as a diplomat , before joining a doomed band of rebels who were hunted down by the army . 
crippled by asthma and betrayed by Bolivian peasants , Che wrote in his journal on Aug . 31 1967 , shortly before his death : &quot; This was , without doubt , the worst month we have had in this war . 
my illness has sown doubt in some of the others and it showed in our only combat , when we should have caused the enemy various casualties but we just wounded one . 
Cubans gave Guevara the name &quot; Che , &quot; a common Argentine exclamation meaning &quot; hey &quot; that is frequently used by other Latin Americans as a nickname for Argentines .
