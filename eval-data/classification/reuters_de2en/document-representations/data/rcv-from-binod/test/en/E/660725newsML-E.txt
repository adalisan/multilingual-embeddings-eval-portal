German wholesale prices showed a sharp 1.7 percent rise in May from the previous month , fuelled by higher prices for agricultural products , the Federal Statistics Office said on Friday . 
the month-on-month rise was the largest since January 1989 and unsettled the picture of stable consumer prices in Germany . 
prices were up 3.1 percent from the year-earlier month . 
in April , wholesale prices rose only 0.2 percent month-on-month and 1.6 percent year-on-year . 
the statistics office said the sharp rise in wholesale prices in May was led by a sharp gain in prices for agricultural products , which were 7.5 percent higher than April and 13 percent higher than the year-earlier month . 
analyst Ulf Rassat at HypoBank said the jump in wholesale prices led him to raise his forecast for consumer prices in June to an increase of 0.4 percent month-on-month and 1.8 percent year-on-year . 
for the full year , however , his inflation forecast is unchanged at 1.8 percent . 
separately , the Economics Ministry said German economic growth must accelerate if it is to hit the government &apos;s 2.5 percent forecast for the full year , but the conditions for this remain good . 
in its monthly report the ministry said the 1.4 percent annual growth reported last week for the first quarter understated the expansion by more than one full percentage point due to three fewer workdays in the quarter . 
&quot; To achieve the expected 2.5 percent growth in gross domestic product ( GDP ) for this year , a further acceleration of the current growth tempo is needed , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; The conditions for this remain favourable . 
exports remain the main engine of growth , spurred by the correction of the mark and vigorous economies in other countries , it said . 
this helped fuel a steep rise in industrial orders through April , and that month &apos;s disappointing production figures are likely to be revised upward , it said . 
the labour market continues to show little improvement , it said . 
but the May rise in seasonally adjusted unemployment was largely due to lower government intervention , not economic sluggishness .
