Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said Wednesday minority Democrats should stop pouting about a Republican-ordered investigation of last November &apos;s disputed Senate race in Louisiana . 
Democrat Mary Landrieu was certified as the winner over Republican Louis &quot; Woody &quot; Jenkins by 5,788 votes in the Nov . 5 election and was sworn in Jan . 7 . 
but Jenkins says her victory was due to widespread voter fraud and wants the Senate to overturn the result and order a new election . 
the Republican majority on the Senate Rules Committee voted last week for a full-scale investigation of the election over strong Democratic protests that Jenkins had not produced evidence to back up his charges . 
Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Friday Democrats would filibuster any attempt by Republicans to unseat Landrieu . 
Republicans have a 55-45 majority but it takes 60 votes to end a filibuster . 
&quot; The minority in the Senate seems to be inclined these days to any time they don &apos;t get their way to stomp their feet , pout , threaten , &quot; Lott , of Mississippi , said at a news conference . 
&quot; I would suggest to the minority that they grow up a little bit , realise they &apos;re in the minority , they &apos;re not going to get their way every time , and they should not expect to make irrational and irresponsible comments and not have us respond or act on them , &quot; Lott said . 
&quot; For instance , when the minority leader says that there &apos;s no way , no situation in which the election in Louisiana would be found to , in effect , have been involved in a pattern of fraud and a new election ordered , that &apos;s irresponsible . 
&quot; The issue is not Senator Landrieu or Woody Jenkins , the issue is what happened in the election . 
was there a pattern of fraud in the election ? 
we should not prejudge the results . 
we should go down , take a look on the scene as to what happened and get that information and make a decision , &quot; he said . 
Daschle , at a separate news conference , said when asked about Lott &apos;s comments , &quot; That isn &apos;t worthy of a response . 
investigators hired by the Rules Committee are expected to leave soon for Louisiana to question voters and election officials .
