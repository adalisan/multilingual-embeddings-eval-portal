Keppel Corp said on Monday construction costs for its site redevelopment are expected to be around Singapore $ 1.2 to $ 1.3 billion , based on current market prices . 
&quot; The actual construction cost depends on the total floor area to be constructed and this is expected to be at Singapore $ 1.2 to S $ 1.3 billion , &quot; Lim Chee Onn , senior executive director of Keppel Corp told a news conference . 
Lim said the redevelopment of the 99-year leasehold Keppel Harbour site in western Singapore , with a plot ratio of 1.4 , would start as soon as possible and be completed in three to four phases over a period of at least eight years . 
he said he was unable to give the total costs of the redevelopment project as details of the land costs and land premium were unclear since negotiations were underway with the various government authorities . 
&quot; The land costs and land premium are in the process of discussions and negotiations with the authorities , &quot; Lim said , adding that the tenure of the land was also under negotiation . 
&quot; The tenure of the land is for 99 years and 70 years are left . 
we have to top up the tenure , &quot; he said . 
Keppel and the Port of Singapore Authority ( PSA ) said in a statement they would jointly develop the sites , totalling 52.3 hectares . 
the land to be developed consists of 32 hectares of prime waterfront land , including Keppel &apos;s Pulau Keppel , and 20.3 hectares of mixed land use development . 
Lim said Keppel had applied for planning approval to develop its site into a waterfront condominium with Marina facilities and offices . 
when completed , Keppel &apos;s project would yield a total gross floor area of about 435,000 square metres . 
about 89 percent of the total gross floor area would be used for residential purposes , nine percent for offices and shops and two percent for a Marina club and Marina , Lim said . 
the group hopes to get approval in September and aims to launch its residential project in late 1998 . 
asked if he were concerned about adding to the current property market surplus , Lim said : 
&quot; We hope to provide a unique product and add variety to the property market , not add to the glut .
