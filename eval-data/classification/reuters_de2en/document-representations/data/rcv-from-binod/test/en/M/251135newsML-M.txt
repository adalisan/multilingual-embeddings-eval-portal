a surprise interest rate cut kicked the Australian sharemarket higher at the opening on Wednesday with the banks and finance sector leading the way up . 
the Reserve Bank of Australia said it had cut official cash rates by 0.5 percent to 6.0 percent citing an improved inflation outlook . 
from the opening , the All Ordinaries index added 21.2 points to 2,383.0 . 
&quot; They cut the rates , the market liked it and there was some good turnover early , &quot; said broker Robert Cameron of Cameron Securities . 
the banks and finance index soared 1.9 percent early , compared to early gains in the benchmark All Ordinaries index of about one percent . 
&quot; The companies with ( dividend ) yield have done the best , &quot; Cameron said , adding that while the market may have eased from early highs , it could go on with the job in the afternoon as offshore investors digested the rate cut . 
rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about six to one , while about 35 percent of stocks traded remained steady .
