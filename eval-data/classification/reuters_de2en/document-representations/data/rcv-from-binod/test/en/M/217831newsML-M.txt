Pakistani cotton rates held steady in dull trade on Tuesday as spinners stayed on the sidelines while ginners resisted any cut in prices , dealers said . 
spinners have almost halted buying since the government slashed duties on import of raw cotton and synthetic fibres on Saturday as part of a relief package for the textile industry , dealer Asif Naseem said . 
&quot; ginners are resisting any cut in prices in anticipation of demand from exporters , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But if exporters also remain quiet we may see prices falling sharply .
