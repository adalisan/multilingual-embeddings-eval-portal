Taiwan share prices closed higher on Friday with the heavily-weighted financial counters leading the way . 
the weighted index , recovering from Thursday &apos;s 2.27 percent slump , finished 85.69 points or 1.07 percent higher at 8,081.79 . 
it rose as high as 8,136.09 at one stage but brokers said persistent selling in other industrials , particularly electronics , eroded gains . 
Financials were very strong , rising 3.37 percent . 
brokers attributed the gains in financial stocks partly to intervention by government-related funds . 
&quot; apparently the government does not want to see a plunging market . 
many financial shares are closely linked to the government and buying in the heavily weighted financials is the most effective way to support the market , &quot; said Mike Tsai , an analyst of Grand Cathay Securities . 
Taiwan &apos;s &quot; Big Three &quot; state-run banks rose sharply on hopes linked to the banks &apos; privatisation scheme , brokers said . 
jitters over unsettled domestic politics are gradually easing after President Lee Teng-hui promised at a news conference on Thursday that Premier LIEN Chan will step down in July . 
the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party said it welcomed Lee &apos;s statement . 
&quot; fears of uncertain politics are easing . 
amnesia is one of the market &apos;s main characteristics , &quot; George Hou , a fund manager of Jardine Fleming , said . 
electronics , which fell sharply on Thursday , continued to face selling pressure . 
brokers said players were still divided about the market &apos;s outlook . 
investors will closely follow the development of a scheduled anti-government protest on Sunday . 
the index is likely to consolidate between 7,800 and 8,200 in the near term , brokers said .
