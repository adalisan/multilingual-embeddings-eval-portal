the dollar was substantially higher against the mark and trading comfortably above 116 yen for the first time since early June at mid-session , buoyed by signs that German officials are content with current exchange rate levels . 
German government spokesman Peter Hausmann said at a regular press briefing on Wednesday that there was no need to dramatize the current situation in the currency market . 
he also noted that recent dollar and sterling strength against the mark was improving Germany &apos;s competitive position and promised gains in German growth and jobs . 
the dollar had opened slightly weaker on fears that the planned announcement on currencies would hint at official displeasure with recent mark weakness . 
&quot; The comments were not as mark supportive as the market was expecting , &quot; said Dennis Pettit , foreign exchange manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan . 
following the remarks , the dollar jumped to a session peak of 1.8010 marks and pushed up above 116 yen . 
at midday the greenback was fetching 1.7975 / 85 marks , up almost one pfennig from its opening rate of 1.7885 / 95 . 
it stood at 116.20 / 25 yen against 115.65 at the outset of trading . 
dealers said the German comments overshadowed morning U.S. data , which painted a picture of a healthy economy , devoid of inflation or capacity pressures . 
&quot; I think the data is generally good for the dollar because it shows more low inflation and stable growth , &quot; said Mark Gargano , managing director of currency derivatives at First Union National Bank . 
the Labor Department reported that overall and core consumer prices rose a weaker-than-expected 0.1 percent in June . 
the Federal Reserve &apos;s report on industrial production showed a slightly higher-than-anticipated 0.3 percent gain in June output and an unchanged capacity utilization reading of 83.5 percent . 
the data nudged the yield on the benchmark Treasury bond down below 6.5 percent for the first time since December of last year and helped the Dow industrials above the 8,000 level for the first time . 
the market largely ignored reassurances from German Finance Minister Theo Waigel that Germany would meet the Maastricht criteria for monetary union , but the dollar pushed back near its highs shortly after midday when Waigel said short-term fluctuations in currencies were no cause for concern . 
&quot; I have a funny feeling the market is setting itself up for a tumble , &quot; said John Gariano , vice president at Sumitomo Bank New York , who said , despite the comments , that he believed German officials were uncomfortable with dollar / mark above 1.80 . 
traders were particularly wary of upcoming Japanese trade data , which they said could knock dollar / yen back sharply if it shows a substantial rise in the Japanese surplus . 
a Reuters poll of economists produced a consensus forecast for a 1.1 trillion yen surplus in June , up from May &apos;s 738.3 billion . 
&quot; Economists are looking for a horrendous number on the bilateral trade figure with the U.S. , &quot; said Gariano . 
&quot; If we do get a bad number I wouldn &apos;t be surprised to see dollar / yen back down near 114 very quickly . 
in other trade on Wednesday , the dollar stood stronger at 1.4830 / 40 Swiss francs against 1.4747 / 52 at the open , and firmer at Canadian $ 1.3735 / 40 versus C $ 1.3718 / 23 . 
the pound , which hurdled the 3.0 mark barrier once again in early trade , was slightly weaker at $ 1.6740 / 50 at midday , down from $ 1.6755 / 65 .
