protestors began a fourth week of street demonstrations in anger on Monday over the alleged beating of a young opposition supporter in the Serbian capital . 
in Brussels , U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher urged the autocratic Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to start talking to his restive opponents and said NATO would take &quot; unified action &quot; to hammer home the message . 
more than 40,000 students gathered in central Belgrade on Monday morning in their latest show of fury over the reversal of opposition victories in municipal elections on November 17 . 
the rally was the biggest in days and they vented their anger with a chorus of whistles outside the police headquarters . 
the students were outraged by reports of a savage beating meted out in prison to Dejan Bulatovic , 21 , a worker from the northeastern town of Sid who was arrested on Friday for carrying an effigy of Milosevic in prison garb . 
his mother alleged that her son &apos;s nose was broken , that he was forced to lie naked on the concrete floor of a prison cell with an open window and that , during the beating , a gun barrel was forced into his mouth . 
&quot; Because of disturbing public law and order , ( Bulatovic ) was mistreated in the worst possible way in the worst Gestapo methods , &quot; the students said in an open letter of protest to Serbian citizens . 
&quot; Should we bow our heads and tolerate this ? 
yesterday it was him , today it could be one of us or of you . 
they accused the police of &quot; trampling on the most sacred of human rights , the right to choice and the right to freedom . 
&quot; Let us not allow their crimes to go unpunished , let us rebel against their brutality , &quot; the letter said . 
a five-member student delegation and lawyer met Belgrade police chief Petar Zekovic and judge Dobrivoje Glavicic . 
they demanded that Bulatovic be taken to hospital and those responsible for allegedly brutalising him be punished . 
Glavicic said a team of doctors would examine Bulatovic to see whether he needs hospitalisation . 
independent radio B-92 said Bulatovic was sentenced to 25 days in prison for disturbing public law and order . 
Vesna Pesic , a leader of the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition , later told a crowd of about 100,000 in the city main square that Bulatovic was now facing a one-year prison term for offending the president of the republic . 
neither the police nor the public prosecutor have so far made any public statement on the incident . 
the police have kept a low profile but Zajedno officials are concerned that Milosevic might yet run out of patience and use force to snuff out the protests . 
Christopher , on the eve of NATO foreign minister meeting , delivered a stern warning to Milosevic not to use violence . 
&quot; I think that &apos;s the only prudent course for him to follow , &quot; Christopher said . 
the United States has led a Western outcry over Milosevic &apos;s decision to annul sweeping victories of the opposition alliance in November &apos;s local polls . 
a decision by Serbia &apos;s top court on Saturday to award control of Belgrade city council to the ruling Socialists drew a crowd of 100,000 people onto the capital &apos;s streets . 
the procession marched in a carvnival atmosphere to the tune &quot; I wanna break free &quot; performed by the British band Queen barely overheard in the din provided by whistles and trumpets . 
diplomats were concerned that the legalistic moves by Milosevic and the delays could be test the demonstrators &apos; patience and provoke them into violence action .
