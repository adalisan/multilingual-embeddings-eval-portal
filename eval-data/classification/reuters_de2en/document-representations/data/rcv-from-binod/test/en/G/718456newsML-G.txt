Wimbledon finalist Cedric Pioline and fourth seed Marcelo Rios were second round casualties at the Swiss Open on Thursday . 
Pioline , the first Frenchman since 1946 to reach the Wimbledon final , was trailing second seeded Alex Corretja of Spain 2-6 2-3 when he was forced to abandon the match because of a sore right arm . 
&quot; My arm just doesn &apos;t feel like holding a racket right now , &quot; said Pioline , who twice received treatment during changeovers before retiring . 
&quot; It &apos;s just tired from too many serves , too much this and too much that . 
it &apos;s not that type of injury . 
Pioline said he would return to action at the Canadian Open on July 28 . 
any discomfort Rios felt on court was provided by little known Spaniard Juan Albert Viloca , who swept aside the world number nine 6-3 7-6 ( 7-3 ) . 
while it was Viloca &apos;s first ever win over a top 10 player , it was the second time in three meetings that he had beaten the moody Chilean . 
&quot; That guy , sometimes he plays unbelievable and if he &apos;s playing well he &apos;s difficult to beat , &quot; said Viloca . 
&quot; I beat him before but then he was number 11 , so this is a good win for me . 
typically , Rios had no explanation for his erratic performance against a player ranked 58 places below him , saying only , &quot; sometimes you don &apos;t feel like playing and today was one of those days . 
Viloca will now meet wildcard Nicolas Kiefer , the rising star of German tennis , in the quarterfinals . 
Kiefer , ranked 68 in the world , one spot below Viloca , advanced with a 7-5 6-3 win over American Richey Reneberg , who had upset defending champion Albert Costa in the first round . 
Seventh seed Alberto Berasategui set up an all-Spanish quarter-final clash with Corettja by prevailing 7-6 ( 7-2 ) 1-6 7-5 over Italy &apos;s Renzo Furlan in a seesaw battle that was twice interrupted by rain .
