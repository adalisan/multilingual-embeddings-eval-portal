Turkish central bank injected 17.8 trillion lira via overnight lending at 75 percent on Monday to meet banks &apos; cash demand fuelled by corporate tax payments , up sharply from 3.7 trillion lira it funded at the same rate on Friday . 
overnight money also traded at 74.75 percent during the day . 
T-bill and bond yields continued to drop by around one point after diving by three points on Friday due to a cabinet decree imposing a 10 percent witholding tax on interest income from government securities to be issued with 1997 maturity from November 1 . 
bankers said demand for outstanding t-bills and bonds remained strong because they will not be subject to the witholding tax in 1997 . 
the Treasury will auction 273-day bills on Tuesday with Wednesday value , the first paper having witholding tax charge . 
bankers expect demand to shrink and rates to rise in the auction because of the tax . 
the Treasury had last sold a record 311.1 trillion lira of 365-day bonds at sharply lower yields on October 25 . 
bids for the auction had also reached a record one trillion lira . 
the average yield on the most heavily traded October 30 , 1997 bond closed at 113.90 percent , down from Friday &apos;s 115.04 . 
the second most active June 4 , 1997 bill yielded 113.05 percent versus Friday &apos;s 113.56 percent average . 
Turkish lira closed weaker at 96,850 against the dollar in quiet trade , against Friday &apos;s 96,430 . 
bankers said uncertainty over tomorrow &apos;s t-bill auction hindered activity in the currency market .
