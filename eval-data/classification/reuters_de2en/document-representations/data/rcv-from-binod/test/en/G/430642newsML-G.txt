Italy said rebel leaders from the southern Albanian port of Vlore agreed on Monday to end their uprising in return for swift implementation of a peace deal between President Sali Berisha and his political opponents . 
a declaration by eight representatives of a rebel committee in Vlore , epicentre of southern Albania &apos;s insurrection , was published by the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome . 
it said the declaration was signed on the warship San Giorgio in the Adriatic at a meeting with Italy &apos;s ambassador to Tirana , Paolo Foresti , arranged after the Albanian authorities asked Rome to foster a dialogue with the rebels . 
&quot; The committee ... undertook to favour the immediate handing back of weapons in the hands of the citizens of Vlore and to ensure public order and progressively restore normal administration to the town , &quot; it said . 
it was not clear how the undertaking would be carried out in Vlore , where the uprising that has swept southern towns erupted 10 days ago , or whether it had any validity in other areas . 
the representatives of the Vlore committee had &quot; expressed its agreement &quot; with a nine-point accord on a peaceful resolution of Albania &apos;s crisis hammered out in Tirana at the weekend between Berisha and the opposition , the declaration said . 
the rebels had asked Italy and the international community for emergency aid and guarantees that the Tirana accord would be applied &quot; correctly , rapidly and peacefully &quot; , it added . 
Berisha , his ruling Democratic Party and nine opposition parties signed an agreement on Sunday aimed at securing a political solution to the conflict . 
the accord provides for an all-party government and new elections by June under international supervision . 
it gives rebels a week to hand in their weapons and asks parliament to declare an amnesty for all those implicated in the revolt . 
elsewhere in southern Albania , rebels on Monday ignored the deal and continued to press for the resignation of Berisha , whom they blamed for allowing pyramid investment schemes to flourish before collapsing with the savings of hundreds of thousands . 
latest areas to fall were the ancient town of Berat , abandoned without a fight by the army , and the nearby town of Kucove , where residents pillaged an air force base , one of two important military airfields in Albania . 
more than 40 people have died in the violence in the past week . 
before the weekend deal , parliament had imposed a state of emergency and then re-elected Berisha to a second five-year term , enraging the opposition and dismaying foreign countries . 
Sunday &apos;s accord followed Berisha &apos;s reversal of his refusal to form a coalition with the Socialists , heirs to Albania &apos;s Communist party that ran a repressive regime for 45 years . 
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini visited Tirana on Sunday night shortly after the deal was signed . 
he said after meeting Berisha and the opposition that Italy had been asked to underwrite the accord and monitor its application . 
Italy , which briefly occupied Albania under Fascism in World War Two , has strong cultural and commercial links with the tiny Balkan state , Europe &apos;s poorest country . 
it has been active in seeking a peaceful end to the unrest and has bolstered its military presence in the Adriatic out of fear that all-out war could trigger an exodus of refugees . 
Italy has evacuated 78 foreigners from Vlore in the past week in three rescue missions using military helicopters . 
the latest airlift on Monday brought out six Italians , two Albanians , a German and an American , the foreign ministry said .
