Danish Central Bank governor Bodil Nyboe Andersen called on Thursday for &quot; appreciable &quot; fiscal stringency by the government in 1998 in order to avoid an overheating of Denmark &apos;s economy . 
&quot; The situation calls for an appreciable tightening of economic policy , &quot; Andersen said in a speech at the annual meeting of the Association of Danish Mortgage Banks . 
she said that the Social Democrat-led minority government was planning to tighten fiscal policy in the 1998 state budget to be unveiled in August and said that it was vital that it gained majority parliamentary support for stringency measures . 
&quot; Denmark has solidly based economic growth . 
until now we have avoided serious problems with inflation and the current account , &quot; she said . 
&quot; But our economic development balances on a knife edge . 
Danish inflation is somewhat higher than in our most important trading partners and the current account surplus is very modest , if you take foreign debt into consideration , &quot; Andersen said . 
&quot; The challenge must now be to prevent our positive economic progress ending up in an overheating of the economy , which could spark increased inflation and threaten the current account . 
demand is strong at the the moment and several indicators point to rises , &quot; she said . 
full year 1996 data showed a current account surplus of 10.9 billion crowns , compared to 9.4 billion crowns in 1995 , but monthly figures show the balance going from a 0.2 billion crown surplus in October last year to a 6.6 billion crown deficit in November and a 2.3 billion crown shortfall in December 1996 . 
Danish consumer prices rose 2.1 percent on a year-to-year basis in 1996 , the same rise as in 1995 , using the domestic calculation formula . 
the latest Danish CPI statistics -- for February 1997 -- show a 2.0 percent year-on-year rise using the harmonised European Union calculation method , or 2.2 percent with the domestic method . 
the Danish government has set fiscal tightening at 0.5 percent of GDP ( gross domestic product ) for 1997 , the same effect as set in 1996 . 
( corrects to make clear similar targets were set for both 1997 and 1996 ) .
