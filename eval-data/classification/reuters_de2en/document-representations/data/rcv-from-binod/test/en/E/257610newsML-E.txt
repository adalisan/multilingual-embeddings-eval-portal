the U.S. economy appears a touch winded , but ready to dance a few more songs before sitting one out , analysts say . 
nearing the end of its sixth consecutive year of expansion , the economy has astounded the pundits with its consistent , if unspectacular , growth . 
&quot; This has been a remarkably good run of growth . 
we &apos;ve not really had strong growth , but it &apos;s been good steady growth , &quot; said David Hensley , economist at Salomon Brothers . 
by all reckonings that run should continue in 1997 . 
a poll of 10 major banks and brokerages shows a consensus forecast for 2.11 percent growth in real , or inflation-adjusted , gross domestic product growth in 1997 . 
while that modest forecast will certainly fail to excite most Americans , economists raved over the prospects of a slight slowdown from recent growth rates deemed unsustainable without boosting inflation . 
&quot; The pace of growth will subside , but I consider that fairly positive for an expansion that &apos;s getting on in years . 
the economy is straining just a little bit at the outer edges , &quot; said Stuart Hoffman , chief economist at PNC Bank Corp. 
after growing by 3.5 percent in 1994 and 2.0 percent in 1995 , the economy appears to have grown at about a 2.65 percent annual rate in 1996 , according to the Reuters poll . 
that recent strength has some economists worried about inflation , which tends to rise when the economy operates above its potential , or theoretical non-inflationary speed limit , currently seen in the vicinity of 2.0 percent . 
while the economy will grow near that limit in 1997 , the recent whittling away of available U.S. resources , notably labour , could portend mild inflationary gains , analysts said . 
U.S. unemployment stood at 5.4 percent in November , a level many analysts deem too low to keep inflation from rising . 
growth at the economy &apos;s potential would likely keep the labour market near current levels , which could keep wages and overall inflation on the rise , analysts said . 
&quot; That does imply a gradual increase in wage and price inflation , &quot; said Hensley . 
most sectors of the economy should continue to expand at a moderate pace in 1996 , with the notable exceptions of housing and automobiles , analysts said . 
Single-family home sales fell 9.1 percent in October and analysts said that more weakness lies ahead , especially if long-term interest rates trend higher as expected in 1997 . 
Auto sales should also slow , primarily due to higher interest rates . 
&quot; Those are two big industries with a lot of ripple effects . 
we have exhausted a lot of pent-up demand in the economy , &quot; PNC &apos;s Hoffman said . 
on the positive side , exports should begin to accelerate as Europe and Japan rebound from weak economies in 1997 , analysts said . 
the chronic shortfall between exported U.S. goods and imports should begin to narrow as a result . 
&quot; Instead of bringing down growth , we are assuming the trade balances will begin to level off and become a neutral factor , &quot; said Steve Slifer , chief financial markets economist at Lehman Government Securities . 
the prospect of a slower economy in 1997 with increasing , but still modest inflationary pressures should cheer policy-makers at the Federal Reserve . 
analysts are split over the direction of Fed-controlled short-term interest rates , but they do agree that any increase in the overnight federal funds rate , the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans , will be modest . 
the Fed has not moved the funds rate from its 5.25 percent perch since Jan . 31 , 1995 . 
the economy has avoided many of the imbalances that have triggered rapid inflation and drastic monetary policy moves in the past , which should give Fed officials pause before they raise rates this time around , analysts said . 
&quot; We could easily see a slightly higher growth scenario ( than forecast ) without causing the Fed to act . 
we also could see a slower growth scenario where the risk of recession is very prominent , &quot; said Bill sharp , economist at Smith Barney . 
the ambiguity of most forecasts , with analysts readily conceding the 2.0 percent consensus could be off by half a percentage point in either direction , underscores the humility many economists currently feel . 
few would have predicted the current expansion would have lasted this long when it began in early 1991 , and the experts have little explanation for its duration . 
&quot; The economy looks good to me . 
but every now and then a patient gets a great check-up from the doctor and drops dead a week later , &quot; said PNC &apos;s Hoffman .
