Moscow angrily accused the United States on Monday of arresting a former Russian intelligence official who had gone on a visit to New York after openly acknowledging his former profession . 
in a statement issued on the eve of the U.S. election , the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) hinted that Moscow might retaliate over the &quot; dirty and provocative &quot; action . 
Vladimir Galkin was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) at New York &apos;s JFK airport on October 29 while accompanying an official delegation , it said . 
the statement said the FBI had accused Galkin of having been a Soviet intelligence agent and trying through go-betweens to obtain secret information from the United States . 
Galkin had been a foreign intelligence worker until 1992 but had not been involved in such work since then , the statement said . 
&quot; The U.S. authorities responsible for this provocative act have not yet put their cloaks and daggers away . 
former U.S. intelligence agents who visit Russia will not thank the FBI for this , &quot; it said . 
the SVR said Galkin had made clear what his former career was when he filed his visa application , which was accepted by U.S. authorities . 
it said his arrest broke with the usual procedure of allowing visas for intelligence staff who had left the service and that his arrest was a &quot; dirty trick &quot; . 
&quot; The Americans have ignored that ( normal ) practice and , as is clear from the sequence of events , opted for provocation and laid a trap for a man who had come to them with honest intent . 
in everyday language , this is called a dirty trick , &quot; it said . 
asked by telephone about the possibility of retaliation , SVR spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis said that Moscow hoped Galkin would be released before it came to that . 
&quot; At the moment all efforts are being concentrated on obtaining his release , &quot; Samolis said . 
despite the end of the Cold War , espionage has continued , particularly industrial spying . 
three Russians have been arrested by Russia &apos;s Federal Security Service for spying for the West over the past year . 
a foreign ministry official was seized in April for passing secrets to Britain , and Russia and Britain expelled four diplomats each after the allegations . 
a worker at a defence ministry research institute in St Petersburg was arrested in September on suspicion of giving the United States secret information on Russia &apos;s new attack submarines . 
a retired Russian navy captain was charged last month with treason for allegedly passing state secrets about nuclear submarines to a Norwegian environmental organisation .
