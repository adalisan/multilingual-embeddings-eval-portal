Russian President Boris Yeltsin landed in Germany on Wednesday at the start of a two-day visit during which he was to meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl and receive a &quot; Man of the Year &quot; award from German media . 
Yeltsin &apos;s aircraft touched down at Stuttgart airport in southwestern Germany . 
he was travelling by road to the spa town of Baden-Baden , where the formal part of the visit was to take place on Thursday . 
the talks between the two leaders , their second meeting in three months , were likely to focus on intensive efforts to negotiate a charter defining Russia &apos;s relationship with the expanding NATO defence alliance . 
also certain to be discussed was the most awkward issue in relations between Russia and its closest friend in the West -- the fate of priceless art treasures taken from Germany by the Red Army at the end of World War Two .
