Australian Prime Minister John Howard , defying Chinese threats of trade retaliation , has agreed to meet exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dala Lama on Thursday , Howard &apos;s office said on Tuesday . 
&quot; He is meeting him as a religious leader , &quot; a spokesman for the prime minister said , stressing the talks were not official . 
Howard , who had said he would meet the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner if their schedules allowed , will hold the meeting in his Sydney office on Thursday . 
a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Canberra had no immediate comment but a spokesman for the Dalai Lama welcomed confirmation of the meeting and said it was an encouraging move in the international campaign for autonomy for Tibet . 
Beijing , which views the Dalai Lama as a pro-independence crusader out to split China , warned last week that foreign leaders who meet the Buddhist god-king would &quot; unavoidably have an unfavourable influence on economic and trade relations &quot; . 
the Dalai Lama , exiled from his Himalayan homeland since an uprising against Chinese rule in 1959 , is seeking international pressure to force Beijing to open negotiations on autonomy for the vast but sparsely-populated region . 
he has urged Howard to lobby the Chinese government in support of his campaign . 
the Dalai Lama is due to leave Australia next Monday after a two-week visit .
