the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) said Friday it plans to amend the specifications for its New York Harbor gasoline future in line with changes to Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) standards . 
the amendments will apply to contracts starting with the January 1998 contract . 
also , NYMEX said it will extend the contracts it lists to cover 18 months , compared with the current 12 months . 
these have the same oxygenation and benzene requirements as for the &quot; Simple Model RFG &quot; but the nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound emissions performance standrs are raised to 2.5 PCT and at least 13.1 PCT over the 1990 baseline , respectively , NYMEX said . 
similarly , the contracts will follow EPA standards on oxygenation levels and the EPA has indicated there is a strong possibility that it will increase minimum oxygen standard from 1.5 PCT to 1.6 PCT .
