an Army private who recanted a rape charge she made against a sergeant was sentenced on Sunday to 16 days in the brig in Quantico , Virginia , for going absent without leave to see her parents get remarried . 
the government on Sunday dropped false statement charges against her . 
private Toni Moreland , 21 , of St. Louis , who also had one-third of a month &apos;s pay docked , called the sentencing unfair . 
if she had to make her choice again , she said she would still go AWOL , which she said was done to attend the wedding of her parents , who had been divorced in 1986 and were being remarried . 
the absence was not connected to the sex scandal . 
Moreland was the first of five women at the Aberdeen Training Ground who last month stepped forward to say she had been coerced into making false statements by Army investigators as a sexual abuse scandal unfolded on Army bases across the nation . 
Moreland &apos;s recanting of the statement triggered the congressional black caucus and the NAACP to ask for an independent investigation of the Army scandal . 
but at a news conference , Moreland said she did not feel that the investigation was prejudiced against black sergeants . 
&quot; I don &apos;t believe it had to do with race , &quot; said Moreland , who is white , adding that most of the sergeants on the base were black . 
Moreland &apos;s mother , Judith Ann Moreland , said her daughter was justified in leaving the base without permission because she had been hoping for the reuniting of her parents . 
&quot; I feel 150 percent that she was justified for what she did but I knew there would be a price to pay , &quot; she said . 
Moreland was serving 15 out of the 45 days of restriction when she decided to leave the base to go home to St. Louis . 
a lesser charge for failing to report to formation was dropped by summary court martial officer Capt. 
Christopher Eden despite Moreland &apos;s guilty plea . 
Moreland did not go to formation because she was trying to help her partner who was suffering from morning sickness .
