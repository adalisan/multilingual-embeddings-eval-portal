police investigating a double IRA bombing of Britain &apos;s army headquarters in Northern Ireland said they arrested one man in a dawn raid on Thursday . 
the arrest came less than 24 hours after police issued a photofit picture of one of the bombers , disguised in a Hood , beard and dark glasses . 
&quot; Early this morning , a male from the Belfast area was arrested , &quot; said a police spokesman . 
Monday &apos;s attack at Lisburn , 10 miles ( 15 km ) from Belfast , was the Irish Republican Army &apos;s first attack in Northern Ireland for two years . 
thirty-one people were injured and police called it &quot; a deliberate attempt at mass murder . 
the attack raised fears that Northern Ireland would be drawn back into the 25-year civil war which claimed more than 3,000 lives if the IRA &apos;s pro-British &quot; Loyalist &quot; foes retaliated by ending their two-year ceasefire . 
Loyalist political leaders have implored the guerrillas not to return to violence . 
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton accused the IRA of trying to disrupt the Loyalist ceasefire . 
the Lisburn bombing was &quot; directly and cynically aimed at destabilising the Northern Ireland Loyalist ceasefire ... We must not allow the IRA to succeed in this betrayal , &quot; Bruton told an emergency debate in the Irish parliament . 
the IRA , seeking to oust Britain from Northern Ireland , said the Lisburn attack was intended to put pressure on Britain to allow its political arm , Sinn Fein , into peace talks . 
the Combined Loyalist Military Command ( CMLC ) , which rules over the Protestant guerrilla groups , is expected to meet within two days to decide on its REPONSE . 
its silence since Monday &apos;s bombing has encouraged hopes that it will stick to the ceasefire it called in October 1994 to match the IRA &apos;s own . 
the IRA abandoned its truce on February 9 with the first of a series of bombings on the British mainland , but it had not attacked Northern Ireland until this week . 
Bruton stressed that Britain and Ireland would not give in to republican pressure to allow Sinn Fein into the peace talks without an IRA truce . 
he also sought to reassure Loyalists that his government had no interest in fulfilling the IRA &apos;s dream of a united Ireland unless a majority in the province wanted it . 
&quot; We , the people , in the Republic have no agenda of a progressive takeover of Northern Ireland against the wishes of the majority of people there , &quot; Bruton said . 
&quot; If there ever was such an agenda or mentality here , it has certainly gone . 
Bruton called the full-day debate about the Northern Irish peace process in response to the bombing , but parliament is expected to resist pressure to break ties with Sinn Finn . 
the Irish Times said the parliament &apos;s sub-committee on Northern Ireland had reviewed contacts with Sinn Fein after the IRA claimed responsibility for the attack , but that no change in policy was likely to emerge from the debate . 
Bruton banned his ministers from meeting Sinn Fein after the IRA ended its ceasefire , but Irish civil servants have continued to hold meetings with the party .
