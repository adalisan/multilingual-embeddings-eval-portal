mounting tensions in Iraq were felt in the U.S. stock exchange and futures trading pits on Thursday , with investors selling off shares in the major oil companies and traders briefly bidding down oil futures prices . 
the selloffs were tied to profit-taking on recent gains in stock and futures prices , and a rally was expected in both trading pits if the aggressions escalated , analysts said . 
&quot; If hostilities do erupt beyond missile strikes and Saddam Hussein becomes more aggressive , that could continue to support prices , &quot; PaineWebber analyst Steven Pfeifer said . 
the U.S. on Thursday ordered bombers to deploy for possible air strikes against Iraq , which announced it had fired missiles against air patrols enforcing a no-fly zone in north and south Iraq for the second straight day . 
the mounting hostilities have pushed the stocks of major oil companies toward 52-week highs and fueled a rise in NYMEX crude oil futures , which set new contract highs early Thursday . 
crude oil for October deliveries traded at a contract-high $ 25.30 a barrel , then eased briefly before rebounding to close at $ 24.95 on Iraq &apos;s announcement of missile strikes at the air patrols . 
&quot; My position is that the crude price is not sustainable at these levels , &quot; said Morgan Stanley &amp; Co energy analyst Douglas Terreson . 
&quot; There &apos;s a commercial incentive here for someone to increase production . 
U.S. oil supplies were seen by some analysts unaffected by the military posturing , and buying opportunities could emerge if the selloff deepened . 
&quot; You &apos;re going to have a better opportunity to buy these stocks as prices come down , &quot; Terreson said . 
the military maneuvers halted Iraqi hopes of selling oil to raise money for food and medicine , but U.S. refiners remain well stocked and crude oil inventories have been rising . 
industry trade group American Petroleum Institute this week said crude inventories on hand at U.S. refineries were more than one million barrels above the same week last year . 
domestic crude inventories have been rising steadily over the past four months , muting talk of possible shortages that would fuel a rally in oil company stocks . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think this is the beginning of a long upward move &quot; in oil company stocks , said John Hervey of Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette . 
Texaco Inc was off 3 / 4 at 93-7 / 8 , Exxon was unchanged at 84-3 / 4 and Chevron was off 1 / 8 at 61-3 / 8 in mid-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
