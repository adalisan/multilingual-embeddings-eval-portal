Nigeria is targeting an annual consumer price inflation rate of 15 percent in 1997 against a rate of 28 percent in 1996 , the finance mininister said on Monday . 
&quot; Monetary policy in 1997 has been designed to bring about further reduction in the rate of inflation , induce higher rate of output growth and employment , and strengthen the external sector and the naira exchange rate , &quot; said Anthony Ani in his detailed breakdown of the 1997 budget . 
Ani said the government had targetted a growth in narrow money supply ( M1 ) of no more than 13.5 percent , and of broad money ( M2 ) of no more than 15.7 percent . 
military ruler General Sani Abacha &apos;s fiscal and monetary policies in 1995 and 1996 brought annual inflation from above 80 percent to below 30 percent , but have produced few signs of improvement in living standards for Nigeria &apos;s 100 million people . 
Abacha &apos;s 1997 budget , announced on Saturday , said it was aimed at stimulating growth and development . 
but it put off the question of privatisation , widely hoped for by business and international lending agencies , until after further study . 
the much-criticised dual exchange rate policy was also left unchanged . 
Ani on Monday said growth in gross domestic product during 1997 was targetted at 5.5 percent in 1997 , against 3.25 percent in 1996 .
