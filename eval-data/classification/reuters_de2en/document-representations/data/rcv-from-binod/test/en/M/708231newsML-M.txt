European stocks closed mixed Friday despite new intra-day highs posted in London and Frankfurt and record closes in Zurich and Oslo . 
the dollar recovered some of the losses it suffered on Thursday after expectations faded of an imminent Federal Reserve rate rise . 
but activity was thinned by the U.S. 
independence Day holiday . 
gold tumbled below $ 325 per ounce to hit a 12-year low on fears of central bank liquidation as bullion loses its &quot; safe-haven &quot; status against turbulence in the global economy and as a hedge against inflation . 
prices dropped sharply after the Reserve Bank of Australia said Thursday it had sold 167 tons of gold from its reserves , reducing its holdings to 80 tons . 
many analysts and dealers now see gold sliding to $ 300 or lower within the next couple of weeks . 
&quot; If central banks are prowling around , there &apos;s no given level at which gold will settle , &quot; one analyst said . 
London &apos;s FTSE-100 index was volatile , opening lower , climbing to a record high at 4,879 and then dropping again to close in negative territory . 
traders attributed the swings to derivatives-related activity . 
&quot; It is difficult to tell how much of today &apos;s business was genuine trading and how much related to arbitrage positions in the derivatives , &quot; said Tim Huddart , Merrill Lynch UK equities strategist . 
exporters &apos; stocks were London &apos;s biggest losers , suffering from worries that the pound &apos;s recent strength would cut into profits . 
Germany &apos;s DAX index closed sharply higher , but off its record 3,945.68 reached early in the day . 
traders said shares were boosted by Wall Street &apos;s strong close overnight . 
the Dow Jones industrial average soared 100.43 points on Thursday to close at a record 7,895.81 after a smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. June payrolls confirmed moderating growth amid low inflation . 
France &apos;s CAC-40 index ended slightly lower in sluggish trade , consolidating recent gains . 
Swiss and Norwegian shares were more buoyant , each posting record high closes . 
Swiss stocks ended up 41.6 points at 5,846.50 and Norwegian stocks closed up 0.58 percent at the day &apos;s peak of 1,237.74 . 
Hong Kong stocks tumbled to a sharply lower close Friday as uncertainty about government plans to curb rising real estate prices rattled property stocks . 
an initial rally of 123.79 points , following new record highs on Wall Street overnight , were quickly wiped out and the Hang Seng Index closed with a loss of 232.77 points , or 1.55 percent , at 14,822.97 after reaching a session low of 14,727.48 . 
the Tokyo stock market &apos;s benchmark Nikkei index ended below the 20,000 level , the first time it has done so since the end of May , depressed by news that construction firm Tokai Kogyo Co . Ltd decided to apply for court protection , brokers said . 
the Nikkei average finished 153.41 points or 0.76 percent lower at 19,968.00 . 
it last closed below 20,000 on May 27 at 19,889.89 . 
during the session , it fell as low as 19,907.39 . 
Nikkei 225 September futures ended 260 points down at 19,910 . 
in currency markets , the dollar rebounded from session lows made after the U.S. unit slipped on Thursday on the soft U.S. jobs report . 
the dollar fell on perceptions the Federal Reserve would not have to raise U.S. rates at its next policy-making meeting in August to rein in growth and inflation . 
the dollar &apos;s softness had lingered into early European trading on Friday , hitting a one-week low against the yen . 
but the currency subsequently found support above 113 yen and 1.75 marks . 
in late trading , the dollar was within striking distance of a 40-month high against the mark . 
but with U.S. markets closed for a holiday , the dollar lacked momentum to pierce 1.7566 . 
the pound lingered just below its March 1991 high of 2.9665 against the mark . 
sterling was helped by perceptions Britain will raise interest rates at next week &apos;s monetary meeting . 
the mark also weakened against the yen , falling to a near 23-month low before steadying at slightly higher levels . 
&quot; The only thing that will help the mark right now is the complete collapse of EMU ( economic and monetary union ) , &quot; said Gerard Lyons , DKB chief economist . 
&quot; Given that looks very unlikely , mark / yen is a one-way bet . 
EMU is seen hurting the mark because the single currency planned to replace participants &apos; national currencies is expected to be softer than Germany &apos;s currency now .
