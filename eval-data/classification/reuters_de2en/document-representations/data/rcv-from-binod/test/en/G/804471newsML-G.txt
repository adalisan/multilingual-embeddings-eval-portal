political factions in the Republic of Congo capital Brazzaville traded shell fire on Saturday night and occasional bursts were heard on Sunday across the Congo River in Kinshasa , residents said . 
&quot; There &apos;s been the odd bit of firing , but only from time to time , &quot; an official with the World Health Organisation in Brazzaville said . 
further exchanges were heard by people in Kinshasa , capital of the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo ( formerly Zaire ) , just after noon on Sunday although the firing was again described as only sporadic . 
last week , battles between forces loyal to Congolese President Pascal Lissouba and his predecessor Denis Sassou Nguesso forced thousands more people to flee Brazzaville . 
peace talks in Libreville , capital of Gabon , have reached an impasse but were expected to resume on Monday , diplomats said . 
the Congolese delegations are back in Gabon after several days of consultations with their leaders in Brazzaville . 
the two sides cannot agree on who should be named interim prime minister and what his powers should be . 
the caretaker would take the country up to rescheduled presidential elections . 
voting should have taken place in July but the poll was cancelled due to the fighting , which began in June when Lissouba started a crackdown on private militia . 
Lissouba went to Kinshasa on Saturday to see President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , days after an exchange of shell fire between their two capitals . 
Lissouba has blamed Sassou for the shelling that set it off . 
he appealed for a regional solution . 
&quot; He ( Kabila ) is going to get involved . 
he will not be alone . 
we would like to see all of Central Africa get involved , because this problem is African , and African problems should preferably be resolved by Africans , &quot; he said on state television . 
Kabila said an African peacekeeping force should be set up to stop the conflict . 
&quot; We think that we must have an African peacekeeping force so that normal life can resume , constitutional life , &quot; he said without elaborating . 
the United Nations backs the idea of an African peacekeeping force but wants a real end to hostilities before it is sent in .
