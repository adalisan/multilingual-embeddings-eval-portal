a U.S. presidential envoy shuttled between Israelis and Palestinians on Friday trying to rescue Middle East peace but publicly the two sides stuck to positions that had plunged the region into crisis . 
backed by tanks and helicopters , thousands of Israeli police and soldiers girded for a ninth day of violent West Bank demonstrations against Israel &apos;s construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem . 
in Hebron , Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse scores of Palestinian stone-throwers . 
witnesses said six protesters were taken to hospital with rubber bullet wounds . 
envoy Dennis Ross met chief Palestinian negotiators in Jerusalem for two hours on Friday before heading into a meeting with Israel &apos;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Foreign Minister David Levy and Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai . 
&quot; We are going through a major crisis in this peace process , &quot; Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said after meeting Ross . 
&quot; Mr Netanyahu knows very well and if he takes one look in the mirror he would realise the reasons for this escalation of violence and counter-violence and Mr Netanyahu realises that settlement and peace do not go together , &quot; he told reporters . 
Erekat said the only way out of the crisis was for Israel to stop work on a 6,500-home settlement for Jews on a hilltop the Israelis call Har Homa and the Arabs call Jabal Abu Ghneim . 
Arabs view East Jerusalem , which Israel occupied in 1967 and annexed , as the capital of a future Palestinian state . 
Ross said at the start of his mission this week that he would report back to U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington at the weekend so &quot; the president can decide what the next proper move should be &quot; . 
Israel &apos;s cabinet demanded again on Friday an end to the violence that climaxed a week ago when a Palestinian suicide bomber killed three women at a Tel Aviv cafe . 
Israel accuses PLO leader Yasser Arafat of giving a tacit &quot; green light &quot; to attacks . 
a cabinet statement said Arafat , when he met Ross in Morocco on Thursday , had accepted a U.S. demand to stop &quot; terrorism and violence &quot; . 
&quot; The test will be in results and action , &quot; it said , and Netanyahu &apos;s spokesman Shai Bazak was unyielding on the issue which unleashed the Palestinian rage , telling Channel Two Television : &quot; We will build in Jerusalem because it &apos;s our right . 
Israeli security chiefs warned of a potential surge of unrest peaking on Sunday -- the annual &quot; Land Day &quot; when Israeli Arabs stage protests against government confiscation of lands . 
&quot; We see the next three days , Friday , Saturday and Sunday ... as record days for tension , &quot; Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki said . 
the violence overshadowed Easter celebrations on Good Friday at the traditional site of Jesus &apos;s crucifixion in Jerusalem . 
industry officials say tourism is down 15 to 18 percent during the peak season around Easter , when Christians mark the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus , and Passover , the Jewish holiday marking the biblical exodus from Egypt . 
Arafat arrived in Tunis on Friday to brief President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali on the crisis before flying home to the self-ruled Gaza Strip to chair a cabinet meeting .
