Morocco on Saturday said it could not confirm or deny a recent reported high-level meeting between Polisario and Moroccan officials to break the deadlock over a self-determination referendum on Western Sahara . 
&quot; The information related to the meeting came from abroad ... Morocco cannot confirm or deny it because we do not want get into speculation , &quot; Interior Minister Driss Basri told a news conference in Rabat . 
press reports abroad said Polisario leaders and senior Moroccan officials recently met for the first time in more than three years , in Geneva and Tangier , including a meeting with Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed . 
in Algiers , Essalek Bobih Youssef , ambassador of the self-proclaimed Saharan Arab Democratic Republic , said : 
&quot; We can neither confirm or deny the reports but we reiterate our keenness for dialogue to overcome the present ( political ) impasse which does not serve the interests of Polisario and Morocco as well as the region . 
a United Nations referendum was to have been held in January 1992 to decide whether Western Sahara , a former Spanish colony , should be incorporated into Morocco , which controls most of the territory , or become independent , as sought by Polisario . 
a U.N.-monitored ceasefire , which ended the desert war , has been in effect since September 1991 . 
but the referendum has been repeatedly postponed because of differences over who should be allowed to vote . 
the last time the two sides officially met was in July 1993 in the Western Sahara capital of Laayoun .
