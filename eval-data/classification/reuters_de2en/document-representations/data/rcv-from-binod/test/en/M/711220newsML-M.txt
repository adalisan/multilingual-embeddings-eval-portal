high sulphur fuel oil barges traded slightly higher early on Monday before steadying with little demand said to be pressuring the market , while cargoes were steady to a little firmer after swaps ticked up . 
after an initial trade at $ 86 fob Rotterdam , or 50 to 75 cents a tonne over Friday &apos;s close , high sulphur fuel barges moved higher to talk at $ 87 for running refinery material before coming down again to be offered between $ 85 and $ 86 , with buying interest $ 1 lower . 
&quot; The offers have gone down a little now ... Bunker demand is low , &quot; one trader said . 
but despite the low demand , bunkers were largely steady , trading at $ 86 / $ 87 for 380 cSt material . 
low sulphur barges were quiet but traders said they were assessed notionally at $ 95 / $ 97 a tonne fob , or unchanged from late last week . 
there may be some demand but I still have nothing concrete on my desk , but then it is a typical Monday morning , &quot; one trader said . 
traders have said on Friday that buyers were waiting for prices to fall before making any purchases .
