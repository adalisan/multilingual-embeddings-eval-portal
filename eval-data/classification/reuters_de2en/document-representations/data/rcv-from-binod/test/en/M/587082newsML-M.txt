Canadian T-bills opened firmer in active trade on Thursday , helped primarily by gains in the Canadian dollar overnight , analysts said . 
&quot; The improvement in the currency certainly firmed up bill prices , but after the release of the ( U.S. ) numbers at 8 : 30 things have kind of just gone dead , &quot; said Doug Sannuto , managing director of Canada cash markets with Bank of Montreal . 
Canada &apos;s three-month when-issued T-bill firmed to yield 3.09 percent from 3.10 percent at Wednesday &apos;s close . 
Canadian T-bills began the session stronger in tandem with gains in the Canadian dollar . 
Canada &apos;s dollar opened stronger at C $ 1.3846 ( US $ 0.7222 ) on Thursday as investors showed good interest to buy the unit before and after the release of Canadian inflation data . 
statistics Canada said the country &apos;s consumer price index less food and energy prices -- so called core CPI -- rose 1.8 percent on the year , in line with expectations . 
the report in itself did not have a major impact on T-bill prices but did show Canada &apos;s positive inflation fundamentals remain intact , analysts said . 
analysts said Canadian financial markets are now keenly awaiting the release of the Bank of Canada &apos;s semi-annual monetary policy report this morning . 
the report is expected to yield clues about central bank &apos;s intentions with regard to domestic interest rates and the currency . 
in other prices , the six-month when-issued T-bill softened to yield 3.43 percent from 3.42 percent on Wednesday . 
the one-year T-bill firmed to yield 3.99 percent from 4.0 percent . 
the call loan rate traded at 3.15 percent , in the upper half of the Bank of Canada &apos;s 2.75-3.25 percent target range .
