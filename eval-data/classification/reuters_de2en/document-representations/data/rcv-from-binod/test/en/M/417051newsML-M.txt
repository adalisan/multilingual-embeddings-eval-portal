world oil prices continued their tentative recovery on Tuesday following a late rally on Monday which pulled levels up from fresh lows . 
&quot; sentiment was still negative ( on Monday ) as the markets dipped and then pared losses by the end of the day , &quot; said brokers GNI Ltd in London in a report . 
&quot; That is not to say a fundamental floor has necessarily been found yet . 
world benchmark North Sea Brent Blend crude oil futures for April delivery closed up 58 cents at $ 19.50 a barrel on London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange , boosted in late trade by a wave of short-covering . 
on Monday , Brent fell to an eight-month low of $ 18.68 as the market continued a headlong slide in prices which has seen Brent plummet by nearly $ 6 from the year &apos;s high of $ 24.91 hit in January . 
a mild northern hemisphere winter , which has stunted demand for heating oil and allowed global inventories to recover from historically low levels , and rising output from producers both inside and outside the Organisation of Petroleum exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , lie behind the steep price slide . 
but any significant further price falls were likely to be delayed at least until after the closely monitored American Petroleum Institute ( API ) U.S. inventory report is released later on Tuesday . 
April crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) had slipped below the $ 20 mark on Monday to a low of $ 19.96 , the lowest level since June 26 , 1996 , but rallied strongly in late trade on Tuesday as buyers came in to square positions . 
&quot; Part of this is pre-API short-covering , but we were also able to bounce back after making new lows yesterday , so this is some follow-through from this , &quot; said Refco Inc vice president Victor Yu in New York . 
the API inventory report is expected to show a draw of one to two million barrels in distillates , which include heating oil , in the latest week because of the recent mild weather . 
a colder spell in part of the United States this week was seen providing only limited support . 
&quot; With the winter almost over , the cold is expected to be very temporary , no-one is getting too excited about this influence , &quot; said brokers GNI in London .
