Throngs of Moslems performed on Friday the final rituals of this year &apos;s tragic Haj pilgrimage in which a ravaging blaze killed 343 people and injured 1,290 . 
but some pilgrims were still struggling to find relatives who went missing in the mayhem . 
&quot; Four of my relatives travelled here from the United States to perform Haj . 
he and other pilgrims were seeking clues on the whereabouts of relatives who went missing after Tuesday &apos;s fire which swept through 70,000 tents at a Haj compound outside the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia . 
I have been looking for him since the fire , &quot; said one Indian woman desperate for information on her husband . 
in Tehran , Iranian head of judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said the pilgrims &apos; own negligence might have caused the fire but added that it was &quot; the duty of the ( Saudi ) government to protect the lives of pilgrims and their safety &quot; . 
&quot; We say to Saudi leaders that we ought not every year witness such accidents ... in the house of God and the safe sanctuary of the divine shrine , &quot; said Yazdi in a Friday prayer sermon broadcast on Tehran radio . 
Iran said none of its 72,000 pilgrims were hurt in the fire . 
police helicopters flew overhead while pilgrims in seamless white robes hurled stones at three pillars symbolising the devil on the outskirts of Mecca -- the last ritual of Haj which climaxed on Wednesday at Mount Arafat where the prophet Mohammad gave his last sermon 14 centuries ago . 
some two million Moslems celebrated the EID al-Adha feast at the end of the Haj pilgrimage this year . 
trucks delivered bottles of water and milk to pilgrims , many of them carrying umbrellas to ward off the scorching sun . 
ambulances ferried to hospitals pilgrims hit by illness and fatigue from hours of walking between holy sites in the heat . 
tense relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran usually take a turn for the worse every year over the staging during Haj of a political rally by Iranian pilgrims . 
radical Shi &apos;ite Iran says Moslems should air their grievances during Haj , mainly through rallies to denounce Israel and the United States as enemies of Islam . 
Conservative Sunni Saudi Arabia says the pilgrimage is purely religious and should not be politicised and bans all political activities during Haj . 
Iran has said pilgrims twice held the rallies this year . 
there was no word from Saudi authorities on the report . 
on Thursday , a small fire broke out but was quickly extinguished in the same pilgrim tent city where the earlier blaze erupted . 
the Saudi civil defence authority said the fire , which was extinguished in minutes , caused no damage at the encampment in MENA , 11 km ( seven miles ) from Mecca .
