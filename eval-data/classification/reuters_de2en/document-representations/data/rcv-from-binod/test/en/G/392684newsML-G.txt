Lawrence Singleton , convicted in California more than 10 years ago of raping a 15-year-old girl and then chopping off her arms , was in police custody on Thursday facing charges he murdered an unidentified woman , police said . 
Singleton , 69 , served eight years of a 14-year sentence for raping and mutilating Mary Vincent in 1978 . 
when he was released on parole , no community in California would take him and he spent almost a month after his release living on the grounds of San Quentin prison before moving to Florida . 
Vincent testified she pretended to be dead after he cut off her forearms so that he would leave . 
she managed to make her way to a highway where she was spotted and taken to a hospital . 
on Wednesday night , a Hillsborough County sheriff &apos;s deputy called by neighbours found the nude body of a woman in Singleton &apos;s home , a police spokesman said . 
Singleton , who was covered with blood when the deputy arrived , first said he had cut himself chopping vegetables but the lawman saw a bloody body of a naked woman inside the house , the spokesman said . 
after settling in Tampa in 1988 , Singleton was arrested several times on minor charges ranging from shoplifting to mail fraud . 
police gave no other information about the slain victim , but said they planned to hold a news conference at 11 : 00 a.m. est ( 1600 GMT ) to provide more details .
