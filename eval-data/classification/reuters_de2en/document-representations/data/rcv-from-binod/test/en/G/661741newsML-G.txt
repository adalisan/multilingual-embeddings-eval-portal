separatist Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard made it clear on Friday he intends to make the French-speaking province sovereign by 2001 . 
the premier , who took the leading role in the 1995 referendum on Quebec independence , was clarifying remarks he had made promising that Quebec would be sovereign by the new millennium , the Canadian Press ( CP ) news agency reported . 
&quot; The millennium begins the first year , not the year before , &quot; he said in Chibougamau in the heart of Quebec . 
&quot; The year before is 2000 and the first year is 2001 . 
so the millennium will begin , like all millenniums before in the history of mankind , at the first year . 
Bouchard decided to make the clarification after learning that many in the media and among his own supporters had taken his remarks to mean Quebec would be sovereign by 2000 , CP said . 
Quebec separatists have pledged to keep holding referenda on independence until they win . 
for now , however , polls show support for sovereignty is on the wane , leading some analysts to speculate further referenda will be delayed . 
the 1995 referendum garnered 49.4 percent of the Quebec vote , whereas in the June 2 federal election support for the separatist Bloc Quebecois declined to 38 percent from 49 percent in the 1993 federal election . 
Bouchard may not hold a new referendum until his Parti Quebecois wins a new mandate . 
he said he planned to wait until at least September 1998 for the next provincial election . 
Canadian financial markets are roiled whenever the Quebec issue returns to the fore in Canadian politics .
