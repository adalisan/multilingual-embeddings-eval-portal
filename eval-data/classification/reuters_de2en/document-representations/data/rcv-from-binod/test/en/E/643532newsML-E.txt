India on Friday opened a new transit route that will allow goods from landlocked Nepal to reach ports in Bangladesh by crossing through northeastern India , Nepali Foreign Ministry officials said . 
visiting Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral agreed during his meeting with Nepali Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani to open the 71-km ( 44-mile ) route on a trial basis for six months . 
the new transit route has been a longstanding Nepali demand . 
India currently provides other routes but Nepal says the new route , linking Kakarvitta in eastern Nepal with Banglabandh in Bangladesh through India , would be more viable . 
at present Nepali traders ship their cargo through Calcutta in India , which is often very congested . 
Gujral , the first foreign leader to visit the Himalayan kingdom since Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand took office in March , arrived on Thursday on a three-day official visit . 
the two countries signed a pathbreaking agreement allowing private firms from both nations to produce and trade electric power , and made effective a water-sharing treaty that ended a dispute that had soured bilateral ties for years . 
as foreign minister in 1990 , Gujral helped end a deadlock in relations over the kingdom &apos;s transit facilities through India , which had closed down extra entry points used by Nepali traders for 15 months . 
on Friday , he met Nepali businessmen and urged them to tap the vast Indian market and expand the kingdom &apos;s industrial base to narrow its yawning trade deficit with India . 
&quot; You may be sure of finding a market in India , specially since we are all agreed on setting up a Free Trade Area in South Asia by 2001 , &quot; Gujral said . 
&quot; I hope we will see more economic interaction between our countries as a result of these changes , &quot; Gujral said , referring to recent measures to bolster Indian investment in Nepal . 
in the fiscal year ending mid-July 1996 , Nepal &apos;s exports to India totalled $ 70 million . 
it imported goods worth $ 450.7 million from its giant southern neighbour , which accounted for 29 percent of the kingdom &apos;s total trade . 
a Commerce Ministry official said the trade deficit of $ 380.7 million was nearly 25 percent wider than the previous year . 
business officials said the gap could narrow in 1997 , since a new trade treaty signed last December provides most Nepali products duty-free entry into the Indian market . 
answering questions from businessmen , Gujral said he was not satisfied with India &apos;s civil aviation policies , but did not elaborate . 
he later called on King Birendra , the world &apos;s only Hindu monarch , at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace .
