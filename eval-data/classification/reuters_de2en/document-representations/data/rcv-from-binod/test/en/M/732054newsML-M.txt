domestic stock funds played a key role in the frenetic profit-taking Brazil &apos;s stock market saw this week , but fund managers and equity analysts believe it is just a matter of time before they rebuild positions . 
shares recouped some of their losses Wednesday after plummeting over 14 percent in the last three sessions , with some local mutual funds already returning slowly to the market on bargain-hunting . 
but analysts said it is still too early to say whether or when investors who withdrew cash from the funds will put that money back into the stock market . 
&quot; It is difficult to say how those investors in domestic funds will behave as of now , &quot; said Sidney Chameh , chief analyst at Fator Securities . 
Chameh said today &apos;s rebound is pretty much a technical correction following an exaggerated drop Tuesday , when Brazil &apos;s leading Bovespa stock index .BVSP plunged 8.5 percent , its largest single-day drop since January 1995 . 
so far Wednesday , stocks have risen over six percent to 12,343 points . 
he also said some funds are buying to adjust their portfolios after the market &apos;s steep losses . 
Chameh said the Bolsa &apos;s short-term trend remains unclear and hinges on the flow of money into the stock funds . 
local equity funds had been the driving force behind the Bolsa &apos;s strong run-up in the first half of 1997 . 
their participation in Brazil &apos;s fund industry jumped to 12 percent from just four percent late last year . 
analysts believe most individual investors who took profits from the funds Tuesday were originally participants in fixed-income investments . 
they moved into equities , particularly in May and June , lured by the higher returns Brazilian stocks have provided since the beginning of the year . 
rattled by recent newspaper headlines on the Bolsa &apos;s previous declines , those investors decided to take gains . 
the market was also shaken by speculative attacks on currencies in Asian emerging markets , some of which struck chords of similarity to Brazil with their bloated fiscal and trade accounts . 
fears that the real could be hurt as well shook the stock market , though most traders never entertained the notion that Brazil would devalue . 
analysts could not estimate how much money exited the stock funds in the last three days . 
but government bank Banco do Brasil alone saw 100 million reais in outflows from stock funds held by retail investors in the last few days . 
Brazil &apos;s largest fund manager said its funds &apos; assets , which had grown to 950 million reais before this week &apos;s slump from 250 million reais early this year , are now estimated at about 850 million reais . 
&quot; We can still see more outflows , but nothing that significant , &quot; said Evandro Lopes de Oliveira , capital markets director at Banco do Brasil . 
Oliveira said he has instructed his staff in Banco do Brasil branches across the country to tell clients there is no reason for panic as the Bolsa historically falls sharply in short periods of time . 
&quot; It is not usual to see successive sharp drops ( in the Bolsa ) . 
it has a tendency to stabilize , &quot; he said . 
Oliveira believes investors who are used to stock volatility are already returning to the funds . 
Banco do Brasil manages a total of 3.2 billion reais in equity funds and 18.5 billion reais in fixed-income funds .
