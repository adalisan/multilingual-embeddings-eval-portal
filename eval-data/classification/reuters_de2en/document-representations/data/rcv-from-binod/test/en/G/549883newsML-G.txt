Zairean rebels on Wednesday shrugged off President Mobutu Sese Seko &apos;s refusal to hold talks and said they would take their war to the capital Kinshasa . 
a senior aide to rebel chief Laurent Kabila told Reuters the rebels had nothing to lose from Mobutu &apos;s refusal to meet Kabila on a South African navy ship . 
rebel foreign policy strategist Bizima Karaha said : &quot; No change in venue will be accepted by us . 
the aide said rebels were consolidating a push towards the capital from Kikwit , 390 km ( 240 miles ) east of Kinshasa , to eject Mobutu from Africa &apos;s third largest country . 
&quot; We lose nothing by not meeting Mr Mobutu . 
if anything we have bent backwards too much for the man given our military superiority on the ground , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We are more than happy to take the war to Kinshasa and end Mobutu &apos;s arrogance . 
in fact , our forces are consolidating their approach towards Kinshasa . 
he ( Mobutu ) must know it is the end game . 
asked whether Kabila , who had accepted talks with Mobutu on the South African ship , would agree to a change in venue , Karaha shook his head : &quot; No way . 
why should we accept that ? 
Mobutu prefers French-speaking Gabon but Karaha said it was out of the question . 
&quot; We are not going to Gabon at all . 
we can go to South Africa . 
we can go to the vessel but that &apos;s it . 
South African hopes of a meeting between Mobutu and Kabila were dashed on Tuesday night when a U.S. diplomat in Lubumbashi said Mobutu had rejected a proposal to hold the talks at sea . 
the diplomat , travelling with U.S. envoy Bill Richardson , said Mobutu told Richardson on Tuesday he would not attend talks on a ship offered by South African President Nelson Mandela . 
&quot; Mobutu told Richardson there is no way he would be travelling to a ship for talks with Kabila , &quot; the diplomat said after talks between Kabila and the U.S. envoy . 
&quot; So once again the venue for the face-to-face meeting remains a problem . 
Mobutu , who has cancer , has ruled out South Africa as a venue as too far . 
Kabila ruled out Congo &apos;s capital Brazzaville , over the river from Kinshasa on security grounds . 
South Africa said on Wednesday it was surprised at the hitch to the planned Zairean peace talks and urged both sides to hurry to the negotiating table . 
South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad told state radio on Wednesday he had not expected the setback . 
&quot; The urgency of the situation necessitates that the talks start very quickly ... we would urge both parties not to hesitate any more , and not to cause any more delays , and to move quickly to the negotiating table . 
Kabila &apos;s forces have captured more than half of the vast central African state since October and seized Kikwit on Tuesday . 
Kabila says talks must be brief and only discuss Mobutu &apos;s resignation , otherwise the rebel army will remove him . 
Richardson met Mobutu in Kinshasa on Tuesday before flying to rebel-held Lubumbashi for talks with Kabila . 
on Wednesday he flew to the northeastern Zairean capital of Kisangani to assess the plight of Rwandan refugees and was to later fly to Kinshasa for a second round of talks with Mobutu . 
Kabila told Richardson in Lubumbashi he was willing to be flexible on a 60-day deadline he has given the United Nations to repatriate all Rwandan refugees provided he saw progress . 
&quot; We want to see seriousness on the part of the U.N. that repatriation is actually taking place , &quot; Kabila told Reuters . 
he said he was still committed to an independent team to investigate alleged killings in the refugee camps but wanted rebels to be represented and consulted on its composition .
