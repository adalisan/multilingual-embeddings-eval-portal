White sugar futures held earlier firmness at the close on Tuesday . 
but the price lost some of its momentum as the expected surge on the raws market failed to materialise . 
at the close the spot August contract was at $ 318.00 , up $ 1.40 on volume of 1,631 lots and October had gained $ 1.70 at $ 307.90 on a turnover of 524 lots . 
the spot contract had broken through nearby resistance at $ 317.50 and traders said they had expected the price to rally further once July raws hit buy stops at 11.10 cents / lb . 
traders said while there was probably more upside potential for August whites , a correction would have to come as physical buyers would just wait for lower prices . 
Paris trading remained subdued with August up $ 1.20 at $ 318.00 and October $ 0.50 ahead at $ 303.50 .
