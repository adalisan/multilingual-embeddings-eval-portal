Ghana striker Tony Yeboah , desperate for a move from English side Leeds , has reportedly made prospective employers an incredible offer -- a money-back guarantee that he will score 15 goals next season . 
&quot; If I don &apos;t score 15 goals , then I &apos;ll give back half my salary , &quot; Yeboah told Saturday &apos;s edition of the German newspaper Bild . 
the former Eintracht Frankfurt forward , who was training this week in the German city of Mainz , said he now planned to return to Ghana but added : &quot; If a club shows an interest , I &apos;ll come back straight away . 
Yeboah , 31 , is still under contract with Leeds but wants to leave because he does not get on with manager George Graham . 
he has not appeared for pre-season training in England . 
it is believed that Leeds have given him the go-ahead to leave if he can find a club to pay a transfer fee of around $ 1.7 million .
