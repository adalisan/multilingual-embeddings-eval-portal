precious metals sank to fresh lows in European trading on Wednesday afternoon , dragged lower in the wake of the overwhelmingly bearish gold market . 
gold , which has shed $ 10 in a month under selling pressure from producers and investment funds , fixed at $ 373.00 an ounce , a fresh low since January 1995 , versus $ 373.95 in the morning . 
&quot; Gold is still continuing its weakening trend , &quot; a London-based dealer said . 
&quot; But ahead of thanksgiving , people don &apos;t want to take new positions and we should see some support at $ 372 , so we &apos;ve probably seen the lows for now , &quot; he added . 
gold was bid as low as $ 372.50 so far during the session . 
dealers and analysts said gold threatened to plummet further towards the critical $ 370 an ounce level in the near term . 
&quot; The market is so bearish right now , there &apos;s got to be a realistic chance of a further shake out , &quot; said analyst Rhona O &apos;Connell of stockbroker T. Hoare and Co . 
the rest of the precious metals -- silver , platinum and palladium -- have become casualties of gold &apos;s weakness . 
silver fixed at a fresh 20-month low of $ 4.74 an ounce , and traded as low as $ 4.70 , dealers said . 
platinum sank lower in the afternoon at $ 376.35 an ounce , the lowest since December 7 , 1993 , from $ 377.75 earlier and palladium also weakened to fix at $ 114.50 in the afternoon , a fresh low since April 20 , 1993 . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing fundamental pushing platinum and palladium lower . 
they &apos;re just being sucked down by the bearish sentiment surrounding gold , &quot; a London-based dealer said . 
the negative cast in the gold market deepened last week following comments from a director of the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) that the SNB may eventually take a more pro-active approach to its gold reserves . 
on the same note , uncertainty over gold &apos;s future role in the European Monetary Union was also unnerving the bullion market . 
&quot; People think that gold is not going to play a big role . 
that would encourage more central bank selling , in which case $ 350 here we come , &quot; a dealer said . 
more immediately , reported forward selling by gold mining houses in South Africa and Australia has been depressing prices . 
any rallies were expected to be sold down by producers anxious to lock in their prices . 
soaring stock markets were continuing to discourage investors from putting money into the precious metals . 
&quot; You &apos;ve got producers panic selling on the way down . 
and money is also flowing out of metals and into the equity markets . 
with the Dow where it is , no one cares a whit for metals , &quot; a London-based bullion dealer noted . 
demand , although in theory at its annual peak , was not big enough to counteract the downward pressure . 
&quot; The Asian demand has picked up on a seasonal basis , but it &apos;s not as rampant as it usually is , &quot; O &apos;Connell said
