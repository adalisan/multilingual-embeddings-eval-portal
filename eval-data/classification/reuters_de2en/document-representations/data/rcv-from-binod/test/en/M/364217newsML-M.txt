U.S. Midwest direct cash hogs Friday sold steady to $ 0.50 per cwt lower amid continued light demand from packers who are operating under unprofitable margins , livestock dealers and packer buyers said . 
Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs sold $ 0.50 lower at $ 51.50 to $ 52.50 in the country and $ 52.50 to $ 53.50 for hogs delivered to the plant , sources there said . 
Illinois hogs sold steady to $ 0.50 lower at $ 52.00 to $ 53.50 in the country and $ 53.00 to $ 53.50 at plants . 
Indiana / Ohio hogs sold $ 0.50 lower at $ 50.00 to $ 51.50 in the country and $ 52.00 to $ 53.00 at plants . 
&quot; With margins still poor nobody is out there chasing after hogs , &quot; a southern Minnesota hog buyer said . 
Packer operating margins have been kept in the red by sluggish retail pork demand , livestock dealers said . 
however , pork prices were seen recovering following this week &apos;s light slaughter which has reduced pork stocks . 
fresh loins were quoted by USDA unevenly steady Thursday , bellies were steady , lean trimmings were $ 2.00 to $ 3.00 per cwt lower and hams were steady to $ 1.00 higher . 
there were 79.63 loads of cuts and 17.5 loads of trimmings and processed pork .
