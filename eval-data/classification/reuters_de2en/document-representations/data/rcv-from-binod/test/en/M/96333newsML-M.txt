the average export price for Venezuela &apos;s basket of oil crudes and products rose by 88 cents to $ 21.84 per barrel from $ 20.95 on September 27 , the Energy and Mines Ministry said . 
the average price for the year so far is $ 17.45 per barrel , the ministry statement said . 
Venezuela &apos;s oil export price averaged $ 14.84 per barrel last year compared to $ 13.23 per barrel in 1994 . 
the rise in oil prices this year has prompted the Venezuelan government to create an debt rescue fund which would use oil revenue windfalls to pay-off debt . 
the Venezuelan government has based its recently revised 1996 budget proposal on an average price of $ 17.00 per barrel . 
oil accounts for some 40 percent of government revenues .
