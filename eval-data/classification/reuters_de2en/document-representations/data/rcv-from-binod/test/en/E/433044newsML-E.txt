the Brazilian government has taken no decisions on whether it may need to cap demand and believes it is still too early to tell if the economy is overheating , said a senior Finance Ministry official . 
Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros , economic policy secretary , said the government reserved the right to take measures if it saw fit in the future . 
&quot; The indicators diverge in the sense that some show reasonable economic activity and others less than reasonable economic activity , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; We are still evaluating ( the data ) and have taken no decisions , &quot; Mendonca de Barros said . 
&quot; We are watching ( the economy ) with great attention . 
we will keep open the possibility , and that is our natural right , to make changes to our course if needed . 
Brazil &apos;s burgeoning trade deficit , which hit $ 2.0 billion in the first two months of the year , has sparked speculation the government may try to stifle demand by tightening its credit policies or slowing the pace of interest rate declines . 
Mendonca de Barros said the government &apos;s economic team &quot; was convinced &quot; 1997 would show better economic growth than last year &apos;s 2.9 percent and that investment in particular would be high . 
he said the government wanted to balance investment and consumption , reducing the public sector &apos;s role in the economy . 
&quot; We are convinced that the demand for capital goods is very reasonable ... and it is difficult to imagine the increase in consumption this year will be as strong as the rate of expansion seen last year , &quot; he said . 
asked if he expected the economy to reach a state of balance without government intervention , Mendonca de Barros said , &quot; That is the question .
