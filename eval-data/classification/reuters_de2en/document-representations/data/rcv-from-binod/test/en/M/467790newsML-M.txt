SIMEX Nikkei futures ended higher on Tuesday after remaining in positive territory all day on the back of Wall Street &apos;s strong close and the clarification of a comment about future consumption tax hikes in Japan . 
the benchmark Nikkei 225 June contract added 470 points to close at 18,420 after gapping up at the open following a strong finish in Chicago . 
Nikkei futures were sold off sharply on Monday after Jiji news agency quoted Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka as saying Japan &apos;s consumption tax could be raised again in the future after a scheduled April 1 hike . 
but Mitsuzuka told a news conference on Tuesday the report was misleading and that he did not intend to consider a tax rise until the year 2005 . 
that boosted the market , dealers said . 
&quot; It looks like yesterday was just overdone . 
I would expect the market to stay around here for the rest of the week , &quot; said a trader with a U.S. futures house . 
&quot; But any break above 18,700 would give a clear signal to trade up to 19,000 , &quot; he added . 
dealers said U.S. markets appeared to have priced in a 25 basis point rate hike by the Federal Reserve at Tuesday &apos;s policy-making meeting , but a more aggressive move could cause volatility . 
a chartist with a local institution said the June Nikkei was likely to head higher to test resistance around 19,500-19,700 over the next few weeks . 
the March MSCI Taiwan index contract ended at 329.8 against its opening 332.5 on volume of 790 lots . 
April was at 322.0 against 330.5 on 1,078 lots .
