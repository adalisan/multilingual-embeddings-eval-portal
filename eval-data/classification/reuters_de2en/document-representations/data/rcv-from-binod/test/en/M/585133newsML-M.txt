Canadian bonds opened weaker on Thursday , pulled lower by weakness in U.S. treasuries , but outperformed amid a stronger currency and a positive Canadian inflation report , analysts said . 
&quot; The Canadian sentiment was stronger than in the U.S. but the U.S. was weighing Canada down . 
the consumer price information was good in Canada , very good in fact , &quot; said Arve Bendiksrud , a fixed-income analyst with TD Securities Inc . 
the U.S. 30-year bond fell 12 / 32 to yield 6.91 percent .

Canadian bonds took direction from U.S. treasuries , which were weaker following the release this morning of consumer price index data for April . 
analysts said the market responded to a 0.3 percent rise in core U.S. CPI as well as fall in jobless claims . 
however , in Canada the inflation picture was much brighter . 
statistics Canada said the country &apos;s consumer price index less food and energy prices -- so called core CPI -- rose 1.8 percent on the year , in line with expectations . 
both the positive Canadian inflation report and strong gains in the Canadian dollar overnight helped the Canadian market to outperform , Bendiksrud said . 
Canada &apos;s dollar opened stronger at C $ 1.3846 ( US $ 0.7222 ) on Thursday as investors showed good interest to buy the unit before and after the release of Canadian inflation data . 
the release of the release of the Bank of Canada &apos;s semi-annual monetary policy report this morning did not have an immediate impact on bond prices . 
in the report the Bank of Canada said it did not see the need for further monetary easing if the economy and inflation developed as predicted .
