Iranians prepared on Thursday to vote for a new president after a night of frantic last-minute campaigning in the streets . 
hundreds of youths poured onto the streets of Tehran on Wednesday night waving posters of former cabinet minister Mohammad Khatami at passing motorists . 
&quot; I &apos;ve been out all night pasting up posters , &quot; said Javad , a university student in Khatami &apos;s army of young volunteers who have waged a nightly poster war with supporters of his main rival , Ayatollah Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri . 
security forces patrolled key installations in the capital and police moved many of the campaigners on , leaving some major thoroughfares and intersections littered with election debris . 
the interior ministry , which is responsible for organising the election and supervising the count , was under armed guard . 
posters of parliament speaker Nateq-Nouri were also pasted on walls throughout Tehran but his supporters did not seem to be so active as those of Khatami . 
campaigning officially ended at 8 : 00 a.m. ( 0330 GMT ) , allowing 24 hours for reflection before Iranians elect a successor to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani . 
Rafsanjani , president since 1989 , must step down in August after serving the maximum two consecutive four-year terms permitted by the Islamic republic &apos;s revolutionary constitution . 
the presidency is Iran &apos;s highest elective office but ranks second to that of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has absolute power over all state institutions . 
the post of prime minister was abolished in 1989 . 
the result of the election is not expected to be announced before Monday . 
if no clear winner emerges with more than 50 percent of the votes a run-off will be held between the two leading candidates among the four permitted out of 238 hopefuls to contest the election , probably a week later . 
all four were screened for their belief in Iran &apos;s Islamic system of government . 
the other two candidates are rated outsiders given little chance of making an impact at the polls . 
Iranian analysts and Western diplomats said the election was too close to call . 
the few opinion polls during the campaign have showed no common trend in voting intentions . 
a high turnout of the 33 million Iranians aged 15 and over who are eligible to vote is expected after the liveliest election campaign since Shi &apos;ite Moslem clerics led a revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979 . 
&quot; This election has turned into a referendum on the mullahs , &quot; a Western diplomat said . 
&quot; For the first time since the revolution there is a real debate going on . 
&quot; Many people say they will vote for Khatami but they expect Nateq-Nouri to become president . 
while both of the two leading candidates are 54-year-old Shi &apos;ite clergymen , Khatami is seen as having more liberal views and standing for a looser interpretation of the Islamic values enforced since the revolution . 
he is popular among women , students and intellectuals . 
Nateq-Nouri holds conservative Islamic views and is backed by Iran &apos;s traditional merchant class of bazaaris as well as influential groups of clergymen . 
some 280 people were arrested in Tehran up to Sunday for unspecified election violations . 
no further arrests have been announced , but Khatami &apos;s election headquarters were shut down on Wednesday for alleged violations of election laws . 
both Khamenei and Rafsanjani have warned against vote- rigging . 
Interior Ministry inspectors will supervise the election but no international observers have been invited and vote counting will be done behind closed doors .
