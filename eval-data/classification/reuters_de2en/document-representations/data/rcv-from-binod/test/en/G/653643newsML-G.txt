former French prime minister Alain Juppe , swept from power by the left-wing last week , said on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election as president of the Gaullist RPR party next month . 
his decision , announced to leaders of the Rally for the Republic , cleared the way for former National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin to take over as head of the conservative party . 
the RPR leadership set July 6 for an emergency congress to elect a new leader and try to revive the movement . 
Juppe , 51 , took the blame for the parliamentary election disaster and said he would not seek a new term as head of the party he has led for more than two years . 
&quot; It is normal , fair and in any case in line with practice to draw the conclusions of failure , and , for me , to turn a page , &quot; he said . 
he pledged support for Seguin who told his fellow-Gaullists : &quot; We are ready to carry out a renewal now . 
in order to achieve it , I apply for the presidency of the movement . 
playing for time last week in the wake of the crushing election defeat , Juppe initially called the congress for September without saying whether he would stand again . 
but he was then forced to bow to pressure from many former allies to quit . 
Seguin , 54 , was elected unopposed on Tuesday as the RPR &apos;s parliamentary floor leader in a chamber dominated by new Prime Minister Lionel Jospin &apos;s Socialist Party . 
many leading party members are backing him for the RPR presidency . 
President Jacques Chirac dissolved parliament and called the snap election in a disastrous gamble that voters would re-elect the unpopular Juppe despite record unemployment , a sluggish economy and austerity imposed to qualify France to join a single European currency from 1999 . 
Juppe &apos;s decision to stand down as RPR leader completed a rapid downfall which followed a meteoric rise of a man whom Chirac once described as &quot; the best among us . 
he remains mayor of the southwestern city of Bordeaux and a member of the new National Assembly . 
Juppe , a budget minister in 1986-88 and foreign minister in 1993-95 , took over the RPR when Chirac announced his bid for the French presidency in November 1994 . 
he became prime minister when Chirac was elected in May 1995 but soon saw his popularity crumble to record lows as he began reforming the welfare system and imposed austerity . 
the socially-minded Seguin , a former anti-Maastricht campaigner who recently converted to the euro , presented himself as the alternative to Juppe , calling for the government to give the priority to jobs .
