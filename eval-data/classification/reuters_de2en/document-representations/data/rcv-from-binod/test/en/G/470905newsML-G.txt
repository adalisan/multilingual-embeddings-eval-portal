the two main parties in Cambodia &apos;s uneasy coalition government have agreed to hold the next general elections in November 1998 , an Information Ministry statement said on Wednesday . 
the agreement was reached after the feuding parties , the Cambodian People &apos;s Party ( CPP ) and the royalist FUNCINPEC , had apparently narrowed some of their differences , analysts said . 
Cambodia &apos;s constitution stipulates that elections must be held within 60 days of the ending of the national assembly &apos;s five year term , which began in September 1993 . 
officials of the CPP , at a dinner meeting on Tuesday with FUNCINPEC members , agreed to drop a demand that the draft electoral law bar those with dual nationality from holding seats in parliament and posts in government , the statement said . 
&quot; The meeting agreed to take November for the holding of parliamentary elections , but the exact date will be discussed , &quot; the statement said . 
first Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh of FUNCINPEC and most top members of his party hold dual nationality , dating from the 1970s and 1980s when they fled Cambodia , while a much smaller number of CPP leaders have more than one passport . 
Tuesday &apos;s meeting did not address a controversial proposal by co-Premier Hun Sen , leader of the CPP , that members of the royal family be barred from politics . 
the CPP fears that King Norodom Sihanouk , father of Ranariddh , will abdicate and use his huge popularity to help bring about a royalist victory in the next election . 
Hun Sen had warned that local and national elections would be cancelled if Sihanouk entered the political fray . 
this had contributed to the bad feeling between the two parties , which formed an uneasy alliance after U.N.-run elections in 1993 and will be the main contenders in the next polls . 
the Information Ministry statement cited co-Interior Minister SAR Kheng as saying the draft electoral law was expected to be presented to parliament when it next met .
