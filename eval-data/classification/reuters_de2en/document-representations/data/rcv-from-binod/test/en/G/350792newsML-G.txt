the Czech Republic on Monday condemned Sunday &apos;s police violence against pro-democracy demonstrators in Belgrade and called on Serbia to recognise opposition victories in municipal elections . 
&quot; ( The Czech Foreign Ministry ) condemns the brutality and disproportionate police interference , which does not lead to a resolution of the political crisis and further intensifies tensions in the country , &quot; the ministry said in a statement . 
Serbian security police attacked thousands of peaceful demonstrators overnight , injuring more than 100 in the most violent clash since the government &apos;s rejection of opposition electoral victories prompted widespread protest . 
in a country whose Communist government was ousted more than seven years ago soon after a similar clash between police and student demonstrators , the now-democratic Czech Republic issued its strongest statement yet against the Serbian government . 
&quot; The means which the police used yesterday against protesters is disproportionate to the character of the demonstrations and is evidence that the Serbian government is not considering reconciling itself with the defeat which it suffered in municipal elections , &quot; the ministry said . 
&quot; ... immediate acknowledgement of the results of the November elections and a cessation of violence against demonstrators is the only way for Serbia to return to the community of democratic states . 
Czech President Vaclav Havel , who helped lead demonstrations which brought down the Communist government here , has yet to comment on Sunday &apos;s violence in Belgrade .
