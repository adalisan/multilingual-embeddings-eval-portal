thousands of sick and exhausted Hutu refugees straggled south of Zaire &apos;s rebel-held northeastern capital on Tuesday after leaving a camp under rebel orders . 
the Rwandan and Burundian refugees moved south of Kisangani and in the east towards Rwanda as Zaire &apos;s war rivals jockeyed for battlefield position with their first talks tentatively set for Saturday . 
aid workers said nearly 20,000 Hutu refugees , who abandoned their camp at Lula seven km ( four miles ) south of Kisangani on Monday , were in poor shape , straggling nearly 20 km ( 12 miles ) along a jungle path . 
&quot; It is desperate . 
you have people by the side of the road lying on a few bits of cloth trying to cover themselves with leaves and blankets , &quot; said U.N. refugee agency spokesman Paul Stromberg in Kisangani . 
&quot; Now with these rains it is much worse . 
people are lying on their backs moaning or trying to wave to attact attention . 
the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire ( AFDL ) demanded the refugees leave Lula on Monday and move south away from Kisangani city for security reasons . 
the Tutsi-dominated rebels fear the refugees include former Rwandan Hutu troops and militiamen who had a major role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates . 
Stromberg said 700 of the most vulnerable refugees remained at Lula and the rest were strung out to the south , where another 60,000 Hutu refugees are trapped after fleeing rebel advances . 
he said the U.N. refugee agency had made little progress in negotiations with rebels on a plan to move the refugees , some of whom are too weak to walk , by air , road and on foot to Rwanda . 
the agency said on Monday up to 30,000 refugees had arrived at Karuba village in Masisi district west of the eastern city of Goma , which borders on Rwanda , saying they wanted to go home . 
it was unclear why they emerged from hiding but Tutsis in Masisi say the Tutsi-dominated rebels have been killing Hutu farmers in the region , accusing them of siding with the Rwandan Hutus . 
ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko will send a seven-man team headed by his security adviser to represent the government in talks with Laurent Kabila &apos;s AFDL rebels in South Africa this week , Zaire &apos;s state television said on Monday . 
the team , which includes Foreign Minister Kamanda Wa Kamanda and representatives of both the opposition and the president &apos;s supporters in the transitional parliament , will travel to South Africa on Thursday , it said . 
State radio on Monday reported fierce fighting around the rebel-held port of Moba on Lake Tanganyika . 
expatriates and traders in the southern mining capital of Lubumbashi said the Shaba province rail hub of Kamina -- a 24-hour rail journey from Lubumbashi -- fell to the rebels on Monday without a fight . 
AFDL rebels took up arms in October , vowing to topple Mobutu , who has dominated the former Belgian colony in Central Africa since a 1965 coup . 
they have seized a quarter of the country . 
Mobutu , who had cancer surgery in Europe in August , has seen his grip on Zaire weaken as rebels advanced . 
many Zaireans , weary and impoverished after three decades of his rule , welcome rebel advances . 
in New York , U.N. officials said the organisation &apos;s special Zaire envoy Mohamed Sahnoun would lead the talks in South Africa . 
Sahnoun also represents the Organisation of African Unity , which brought the two sides together last week in Togo . 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appeared to have asserted his authority to have Sahnoun play the lead negotiating role following a series of summits and a plethora of special envoys on Zaire .
