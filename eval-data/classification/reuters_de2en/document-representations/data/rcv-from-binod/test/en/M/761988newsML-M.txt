COMEX copper ended higher , picking up steam throughout the session on end-of-the-month spread trading despite a volatile day in zinc . 
LME &apos;s zinc price fell $ 300 in one hour before recouping about a third of its losses on continued rumors of massive Chinese short positions being squeezed . 
&quot; That made copper look all the more impressive , &quot; said William O &apos;Neill , senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch . 
&quot; There was good merchant buying supporting the market . 
we &apos;re building a base at these levels . 
copper also found support from strong London-based fund buying in aluminum and nickel , he said . 
active September settled up 1.05 cents at 110.75 cents a lb , while the spot month ended 3.70 cents higher at 116.50 cents . 
floor traders reported heavy spread trading before the expiration of the July spot contract Tuesday . 
the July-September backwardation closed at 5.85 cents . 
&quot; There was a lot of shortcovering in July , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; July open interest was 1,514 lots . 
so there was a lot of switches today . 
demand is quite strong . 
at least one physical dealer disagreed . 
&quot; The London Metal Exchange stocks have doubled within one month , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Some people are attributing it to arbitrage . 
but if you look only a small portion comes from COMEX . 
total LME stocks have increased 99,050 tonnes to 220,600 tonnes in the same time frame . 
&quot; There &apos;s been a huge build-up in Europe and Singapore , &quot; the merchant said . 
&quot; That &apos;s all excess copper . 
and if the fundamentals are going to have any say in this market , then I would expect lower prices . 
COMEX spot is currently trading at a 8.70-cent premium to the LME cash price , although traders said the arbitrage is an aberration in light of the spike in the COMEX spot price before the expiration of the July contract .
