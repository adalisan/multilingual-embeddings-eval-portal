South Africa &apos;s money market shortage rose almost 1.5 billion rand to over nine billion rand on Monday amid month-end pressures and increased spending due to local school holidays . 
dealers said on Tuesday the upward spike may also be due to a mismatch of flows on the government &apos;s tax and loan account . 
reserve Bank figures released on Tuesday show the shortage at 9.282 billion rand on Monday -- its highest level in three weeks . 
it was pegged at 7.853 billion on Saturday . 
Andre Kock , the central bank &apos;s head of money markets , said there was nothing sinister in the high level of the shortage and denied rumours of a mismatch . 
&quot; It is normal month-end . 
it is nothing strange ... We probably had a few payments to make and maybe lost a few dollars on the foreign exchange side , &quot; Kock told Reuters on Tuesday . 
&quot; It will probably come back again today , &quot; he added . 
dealers said nationwide school holidays had added to spending pressures and may have contributed to the higher shortage . 
&quot; We do see notes flowing out because of people going on holiday . 
those little things will contribute , &quot; a trader said . 
dealers said they expected the shortage to ease again within the next few days with rates remaining unchanged . 
&quot; I think the shortage will come back a couple of hundred million either by tomorrow or the day after , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; If we can maintain rates today and tomorrow , and they look to be moving sideways , then we should not see them going upward . 
three-month NCDs were last trading steady at between 15.70 to 15.90 percent , while 90-day Bas were unchanged at 15.15 to 15.30 percent .
