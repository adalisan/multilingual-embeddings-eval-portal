the oil-rich ex-Soviet state of Azerbaijan has submitted a formal request to be considered for membership of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , trade officials said on Tuesday . 
the request is to be discussed at the next meeting of the 131-member WTO &apos;s ruling General Council on July 16 . 
if there are no objections , the Council is likely to set up a working party to provide a forum for negotiations and preparation of a protocol of accession , a process likely to take at least two years , according to trade diplomats . 
Azerbaijan will have to demonstrate that it is bringing its once strictly state-controlled economy onto open market lines and make detailed commitment to open up to goods and services from other countries . 
but trade sources said that in initial contacts with the WTO it had already promised to work to ensure that its trade practices were in line with the body &apos;s rules and declared it had already moved to liberalise . 
the Caspian Sea state is the 13th of the 15 republics of the old Soviet Union -- which itself stood aloof from the WTO &apos;s predecessor , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or GATT -- to apply to join the body . 
Russia has been in negotiations for over four years and trade diplomats say it is unlikely to be admitted until well into next year . 
of the other two big ex-Soviet states , Ukraine has been negotiating for nearly four years , and Kazakhstan began formal talks in a working party earlier this year . 
the only former Soviet republics who have not yet applied are Turkmenistan , with which Azerbaijan is in dispute over a Russian-Azeri oil deal agreed last week , and Tajikistan which has been torn by civil conflict since independence in 1991 .
