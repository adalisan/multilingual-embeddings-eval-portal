Japan has decided to extend a grant-in-aid for debt relief of 4.0 billion yen to Burma , the Japanese Embassy said . 
&quot; The present grant-in-aid represents the capital and interest of the ODA loans , out of those contracted up to 31 March 1978 , between the governments of Myanmar ( Burma ) and Japan based on their ODA loan agreements , whose repayment fell due in the second half of the fiscal year 1996 , &quot; said an embassy statement received by Reuters on Tuesday . 
grant-in-aid is not required to be paid back . 
the embassy statement said when the repayment of an ODA debt is made by a least developed nation , Japan extends the grant-in-aid of the same amount as repaid debt . 
Burma recently paid back a loan of four billion yen , the statement said . 
some Japanese officials have long hoped to step up financial assistance to Burma , one of southeast Asia &apos;s poorest nations , but Tokyo has yet to repeal a suspension on new loans imposed after a bloody military crackdown on democracy activists in 1988 .
