NWE oil products firmed by an average $ 1 on Tuesday as futures staged a modest recovery from Monday &apos;s lows , but gasoline was unchanged , dealers said . 
Eurograde gasoline was offered at around $ 189 for running refinery Rotterdam material . 
&quot; I think that early deal was a little on the low side , &quot; one trader said . 
swaps were barely changed from Monday &apos;s close . 
dealers said there was still plenty of stored material available and at least one trader seemed willing to offer it . 
heating oil barges gained by around $ 1 a tonne as IPE gas oil futures firmed . 
traders said buyers were unconvinced the market had bottomed out and most kept out of the market . 
high sulphur fuel oil barges gained $ 1 . 
barges traded at $ 86.00 fob Rotterdam and $ 85.50 for lower grade and stored RMG material in early business . 
later each grade had sold at $ 1 a tonne higher . 
traders said bunker demand again appeared poor , but there was a shortage of refined product , at least until mid-month , and still some shorts needing to be covered .
