a controversial business tycoon who has joined Russia &apos;s efforts to end fighting in rebel Chechnya said on Friday that Moscow appeared finally to have won the trust of the rebel leaders . 
Boris Berezovsky , who completed his rise from car dealer to Kremlin politician in October , indicated after his latest mission to Chechnya that the chances of a lasting peace were better than at any time since the conflict flared two years ago . 
&quot; I feel that the Chechen leaders now have much more trust in Russia and the federal government , and it already helps us a lot , &quot; Berezovsky , 50 , told Reuters in an interview . 
Berezovsky , the deputy secretary of President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s influential Security Council , struck an optimistic note one day after returning from Chechnya . 
he said the trip , accompanying Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin , had been crowned by the opening of Grozny &apos;s airport for the first regular civilian flights for months and the installation of a satellite telephone system . 
&quot; I think that in a very short time , every citizen of Chechnya will feel the result of the peace process in his home , &quot; Berezovsky said . 
the many people made homeless in almost 21 months of fighting are less optimistic . 
despite a peace deal signed on August 31 , they remain bitter after the deaths of tens of thousands of people , most of them civilians . 
Russian bombing raids have destroyed many buildings , road and rail links are badly in need of repair and reconstruction work has hardly even begun . 
Berezovsky said the Russian government had made many mistakes during the fighting . 
but he defended Yeltsin and suggested the reason for the separatists &apos; new trust was the president &apos;s announcement last month that he was withdrawing the last of the troops which he sent to the mountainous southern region on December 11 , 1994 . 
&quot; For the first time , this was a step which was not taken under pressure , &quot; Berezovsky said . 
&quot; We had chances to postpone this decision , to play the previous kind of game . 
but for the first time in this difficult and complicated situation , we took a step ahead . 
he said Yeltsin was controlling Chechnya policy , even though he has been out of the Kremlin for most of the last five months with heart problems . 
Berezovsky , whose main task is dealing with financial affairs involving Chechnya , has courted controversy as a businessman and as a politician . 
he survived an assassination attempt in 1994 and his appointment has been bitterly criticised by the opposition communists , who say he is not qualified for his post . 
he controls a vast financial empire , has a major stake in a bank and in an oil company and is a director of ORT , the main Russian television channel . 
Berezovsky portrayed himself as one of a new breed of politicians who have made their mark as businessmen and denied he was making any financial gain from his new role . 
he said his business expertise was vital under Russia &apos;s new Chechnya policy , making clear he wanted to attract investment to the region , and particularly the private sector , to give the Chechens a financial incentive to stay in Russia . 
&quot; It is risky to but it is what we need to pay for stability in Chechnya and for stability in Russia in general , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It is really very , very risky . 
but I discussed it with Russian business leaders and they supported me in the idea to invest money in Chechnya for stability .
