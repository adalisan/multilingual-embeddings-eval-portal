emerging markets debt traded narrowly mixed on Thursday , with Brazil bonds outperforming other Bradys and spreads over treasuries generally narrower , market experts said . 
&quot; It &apos;s fairly quiet , with just a little profit-taking , &quot; said a trader at a large U.S. investment bank . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen strong buying in Brazil . 
in late-afternoon trading , Brazil &quot; C &quot; bonds BR8D14 = RR were up 1 / 2 at 79-1 / 8 bid , boosted by success of a re-election amendment and the country &apos;s anouncement on Wednesday that it will swap or buy back some of its Brady debt , traders said . 
Brazil &apos;s Senate on Wednesday approved a bill to allow President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and certain other government officials to run for re-election . 
earlier on Wednesday , the country said it would either repurchase par bonds and discount Z-L bonds or swap pars , discounts or &quot; C &quot; bonds for 30-year uncollateralized global bonds . 
both developments helped Brazil spreads narrow sharply over the past two days , trader said . 
&quot; I think there were also some locals unwinding short positions today , &quot; one trader said . 
while Brazil &apos;s performance buoyed the rest of the region on Wednesday , it detracted on Thursday , some traders said . 
&quot; Basically we &apos;re getting a reallocation from Argentina and some of the exotics into Brazil , &quot; one trader said . 
other major Latins were unchanged to lower . 
Ecuador spreads suffered from investor concern over the upcoming referendum on President Fabian Alarcon &apos;s mandate , traders said . 
&quot; There was a little bit of profit-taking in Ecuador given the referendum this weekend , &quot; one trader said . 
U.S. trading is expected to end at 1400 EDT / 1800 GMT on Friday , and there will be no trading Monday in observance of the Memorial Day holiday .
