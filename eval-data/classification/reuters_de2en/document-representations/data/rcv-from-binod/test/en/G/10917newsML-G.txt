Wayne Riley and Peter Senior will fight it out for the last remaining place in the international team for next month &apos;s President &apos;s Cup against the U.S. after Japan &apos;s Masashi &quot; Jumbo &quot; Ozaki confirmed he would play . 
earlier this week , international non-playing captain Peter Thomson named the Australian pair as his two nominated players if Ozaki decided against taking up his automatic invitation . 
but Ozaki , the world number six ranked player , has agreed to join the team , leaving only one place still to fill . 
the 12-man international team features the best players outside Europe and will face the Americans in the Ryder Cup-style team event in Washington from September 13-15 . 
&quot; Great for the team , great for everybody , &quot; world number one Greg Norman said , referring to Ozaki &apos;s decision . 
&quot; Obviously it &apos;s good news for the President &apos;s Cup , &quot; the Australian told reporters after his first round at the World Series of Golf in Akron , Ohio .
