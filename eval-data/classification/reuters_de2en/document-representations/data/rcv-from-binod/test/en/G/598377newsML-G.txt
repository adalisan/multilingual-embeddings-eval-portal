other than a brief warmup on Friday , the U.S. Midwest will remain cool through next week , with lows in the 30s degrees Fahrenheit likely this weekend on the northern edge of the area , meteorologists said . 
lows elsewhere should be in the 40s , with highs in the 60s to low 70s . 
a low pressure system over the Hudson Bay was preventing southerly warm air from entering the Midwest and although the system has weakened slightly , it remains in place , meteorologists said . 
&quot; The weather pattern for next week features normal to below normal temperatures for the Corn Belt , &quot; said Craig Solberg , Freese-Notis weather meteorologist . 
a one-day warmup was forecast for Friday , with temperatures in many areas rising to the low 80s . 
after that normal to below normal temperatures should return and remain through much of next week . 
scattered showers of 0.1 to 0.5 inch moisture may spread across much of the belt Wednesday and Thursday , said Joel Burgio , weather Services Corp meteorologist . 
more showers were likely in southerly and easterly Midwest areas , but ending by Sunday , he said . 
the National weather Service six- to 10-day outlook released Monday for the period May 25-29 indicated much below normal temperatures and normal precipitation for Illinois and below normal temperatures and normal to above normal precipitation in Iowa , Missouri , Indiana and Ohio .
