the German overnight call money rate was little changed at around 3.10 percent in quiet trade on Tuesday , dealers said . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty much the same , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; There is some demand here and there . 
demand from the government stabilised call rates despite substantial liquidity , traders said . 
with such demand likely to continue in coming weeks , rates are unlikely to dip much below the 3.10 percent level . 
the trader said the government would continue to seek financing until the Bundesbank &apos;s profits are transferred on April 17 . 
&quot; There are always periods when the government has expenditure needs , &quot; said a trader . 
&quot; But in the current liquid environment , that demand is unlikey to upset the market . 
he said ample reserve levels meant banks were reasonably willing to offer funds , meaning rates were not being pushed up as much as they would be in a less liquid situation . 
several banks predicted that the government &apos;s requirements in the coming weeks would be around 10 to 15 billion marks . 
in its repo allocation , the Bundesbank is expected to about evenly match the 84.0 billion marks of securities repurchase agreements which expire on Wednesday . 
&quot; With call rates at 3.10 percent , the Bundesbank will be cautious about tightening up the market , &quot; said the trader . 
&quot; They will probably try to keep the market fairly neutral with this operation . 
on Monday , banks held 42.1 billion marks in reserve at the Bundesbank , up from 41.1 billion held on Friday . 
holdings for the month remained unchanged at 42.0 billion marks . 
no appreciable amount was borrowed on the 4.50 percent Lombard financing window . 
the Frankfurt interbank overnight rate stood at 3.12567 percent versus 3.12633 on Monday .
