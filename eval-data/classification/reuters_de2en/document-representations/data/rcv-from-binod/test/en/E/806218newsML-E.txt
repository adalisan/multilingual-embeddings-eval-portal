the Bank of Portugal has room to cut interest rates further in 1997 despite surprising markets with a 20 basis point reduction on Monday , analysts said . 
they said that further cuts in its repurchase pact and absorption rates should come regardless what happened in other countries , notably Germany where there is some market concern that rates may have to rise . 
on Monday , the Bank of Portugal cut its repurchase pact rate to 5.5 percent , from 5.7 percent , lowering the absorption rate by the same amount to 5.2 percent . 
some analysts said that the Bank could even cut the repo by a further half a percentage point by the end of the year . 
the prospects of further rate cuts would bring most most benefit to the shorter end of the yield curve where spreads with Germany have not narrowed to the same degree as at the longer end , they added . 
&quot; There is room for more cuts . 
this will not be the last one this year , &quot; said Banco Portugues de Investimento chief economist Rui Martins dos Santos . 
economist Nuno Godinho of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Lisbon said that he saw the spread between the repo rates in Portugal and Germany narrowing towards just 50 basis points as the 1999 launch of monetary union loomed . 
the German repo rate stands at three percent , being last changed on August 22 , 1996 . 
&quot; At the end of 1997 , I would not be surprised if the ( repo ) rate had not fallen to five percent as there is room taking account of the spread with the German rate , &quot; said analyst Isabel Costa of Banco Finantia . 
following the rate cut , yields of three-month forward rate agreements ( FRA ) fell five basis points but most analysts predicted steeper declines over the short term . 
the 10-year bonds , in contrast , showed little reaction to the rate move with the spread with the Bunds remaining steady at 73 basis points . 
&quot; It is at the shorter end that the market stands to gain a lot , &quot; said one analyst at an investment bank . 
&quot; From the FRA up to the three-year ot ( bonds ) , there is room for gains and the yield curve will have to steepen , &quot; he added . 
the yield on the three-year March 2000 bond also dipped some five basis points to 5.33 percent , 120 basis points over the Bund and 10 basis points above the Spanish Bono . 
&quot; spreads are now close to those of Spain , but there is still a way to go against Germany . 
the two and three year spreads are going to have to fall , &quot; said Nuno Espirito Santo of Banco ESSI . 
analysts said that the escudo was not a concern , even if it had slipped slightly against the German mark in recent sessions . 
&quot; It did not react ( to the rate cut ) and there is no fundamental reason for it to weaken , &quot; said another analyst who asked not to be named .
