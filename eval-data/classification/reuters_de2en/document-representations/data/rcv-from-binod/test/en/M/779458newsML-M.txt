the rupee ended up against the dollar at 35.71 / 72 on Tuesday compared with 35.73 / 74 opening on the back of oversupply of dollars and poor demand , dealers said . 
the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) bought dollars from the spot and forward market but failed to weaken the rupee , they said . 
the RBI &apos;s intervention in the spot market did not make any dent on the rupee , but its intervention in the forward section led to a sharp rise in the forward premiums , dealers said . 
&quot; They ( the RBI ) thought spot rupee would weaken through intervention in the forwards , &quot; said the chief dealer at a bank . 
&quot; But it worked the other way round , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Instead of weakening the rupee , their intervention had the effect of dictating the interest rates , &quot; the dealer said . 
the six month annualised forward premium closed Tuesday at 4.81 percent , up from the previous close of 4.42 percent . 
January dollars closed at 0.85 / 0.86 rupees compared to the opening level of 0.78 / 0.80 rupees , dealers said . 
the central bank bought dollars across wide maturities , they said . 
&quot; They were the only payers in the market , &quot; said a dealer , referring to payment of premiums for buying forward dollar . 
some dealers were critical about RBI &apos;s forward dollar intervention , saying it was confusing the market at a time when premiums were getting aligned with interest rate differentials . 
one dealer said the RBI was experimenting and going through a learning curve . 
&quot; At least the phase of reluctant intervention seems to be over , &quot; said a dealer , referring to earlier perceived reluctance of the central bank to intervene for fear of adding to the domestic money supply .
