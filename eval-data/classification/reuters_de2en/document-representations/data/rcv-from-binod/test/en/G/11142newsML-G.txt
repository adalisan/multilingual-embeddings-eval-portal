one person died and at least 10 were injured on Thursday when a tanker carrying chemicals exploded near this small village on the main highway to the central city of Puebla 50 miles ( 80 km ) from Mexico City , witnesses and officials said . 
firemen and army and Red Cross rescue units rushed to the area to evacuate the injured and extinguish the burning truck , which was carrying at least 8,000 gallons ( 30,000 litres ) of liquid propylene when it exploded . 
the driver of the truck was burned to death , Puebla state Civil Protection chief Guillermo Melgarejo told reporters . 
&quot; There are 10 people in hospital with burns , of whom a young boy is in the most serious condition , &quot; he said . 
the blast appeared to have been caused when one of two tanks of propylene being hauled by the truck came loose , causing the driver to lose control of his vehicle and crash as he passed near the village .
