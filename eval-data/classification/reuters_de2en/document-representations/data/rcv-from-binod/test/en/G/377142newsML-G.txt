Tung Chee-hwa , Hong Kong &apos;s chief executive-designate , is a Confucian who loves to preach on the need for harmony and order as he shepherds this bustling capitalist territory from British to Chinese rule . 
on Thursday he showed off his new offices , which boast a soothing view over a waterfall tumbling from the lush green tropical slopes of Hong Kong Park . 
the seventh floor suite will be his base at least until the Union Jack is furled and China &apos;s red flag hoisted at midnight on June 30 , marking the end of more than 150 years of colonial rule . 
he won &apos;t be able to practise his Chinese &quot; Tai Chi &quot; exercises on the rooftop as he once did at his offices at the Orient Overseas shipping company , where he quit as chairman last year in order to become Hong Kong &apos;s future leader . 
but the view should help when he meditates on the growing political rifts and the anxiety about lost freedoms that are prefacing the transfer of sovereignty . 
as he looks out of the window he will be facing east and conveniently turning his back on Government House , seat of the departing British Governor Chris Patten . 
mobbed by journalists as he put his offices on display , Tung lambasted critics , particularly the popular Democratic Party , who have been lobbying the West against China &apos;s plans to roll back Hong Kong &apos;s democracy and human rights . 
&quot; There are people from Hong Kong including the Democratic Party who are overseas talking down Hong Kong as though the world will come to an end here , &quot; Tung said , referring to a current European tour by Democrat leader Martin Lee . 
the quarrel underlined the political tension that Tung has to contend with in his new office in the coming months as Hong Kong prepares to become a Special Administrative Region of China . 
the skyscraper rises in a prime commercial district in one of the world &apos;s most expensive cities , and his neighbours in the building include Hong Kong &apos;s futures Exchange and a clutch of big name international brokerage houses . 
staff from some of these companies told reporters on Thursday they did not welcome the likely disturbance whenever Hong Kong &apos;s news hounds pour into Tung &apos;s 11th floor press centre . 
&quot; That &apos;s not what we expect to put up with when we pay these high rents , &quot; one executive said . 
Tung , 59 , has already signalled he does not intend to move into Government House , a luxurious mansion with a rich history , citing bad &quot; fung shui &quot; , Chinese parlance for an inauspicious relationship with nature but a remark interpreted by many in Hong Kong as an oblique attack on British rule . 
visitors to Tung &apos;s office will find a bright welcome in a reception area with &quot; People &apos;s Republic of China SAR Chief Executive &apos;s Office &quot; in gold lettering on the wall , topped in red with Hong Kong &apos;s new emblem , the tropical bauhinia flower . 
his advisory cabinet , the Executive Council , which he has filled with politicians and businessmen approved by Beijing , will meet in an adjacent conference room around a long oval table , resembling the board room of a blue chip company .
