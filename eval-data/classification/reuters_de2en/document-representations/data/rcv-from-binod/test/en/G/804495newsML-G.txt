two Russian journalists held hostage in Chechnya were freed on Sunday on the eve of tough talks in Moscow between President Boris Yeltsin and Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov . 
the kidnappers released their captives , who work for the private VID television channel , after Russian and Chechen security forces presented them with an ultimatum , Chechen First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov said . 
&quot; The criminals were made to understand that they would be destroyed if they did not comply with the ultimatum , so they released the journalists , &quot; he told Ekho Moskvy radio . 
the journalists , seized in the breakaway region &apos;s capital Grozny on June 11 , were expected to arrive in Moscow later on Sunday . 
Itar-Tass news agency said no ransom had been paid . 
their release came two days after security forces in Grozny rescued an ethnic Chechen hostage . 
Yeltsin is expected to press Maskhadov during Monday &apos;s talks in the Kremlin to do more to help free the many Russian and foreign hostages seized in Chechnya by gunmen seeking ransoms . 
Maskhadov , who has said hostage takers face the death penalty or tough prison sentences , convened a meeting of his security chiefs on Sunday to discuss the hostage issue , which has badly hampered his efforts to restore the rule of law . 
two Britons , five French people , a German , a Slovak and a Yugoslav are among those currently missing in Chechnya . 
in Moscow Russian and Chechen negotiators continued to prepare the ground for Maskhadov &apos;s talks with Yeltsin but there was no sign that either side was prepared to modify its position over the key issue of Chechnya &apos;s political status . 
Maskhadov made clear on Saturday he would not back off from his demand that Moscow recognise his tiny Caucasus region as a sovereign state . 
he said he wanted Russia and Chechnya to establish full-fledged diplomatic relations . 
the Kremlin , whose troops were humiliated by Maskhadov &apos;s separatist guerrillas during a bloody 21-month conflict that ended last August , says Chechnya must stay within the Russian Federation , although with wide autonomy . 
Ekho Moskvy radio on Sunday quoted an unnamed source in Russia &apos;s Security Council as saying Chechnya &apos;s demand for full-fledged diplomatic ties were unacceptable . 
&quot; Russia will do everything to prevent this from happening , &quot; he was quoted as saying . 
Udugov told Ekho Moskvy that Yeltsin should take the initiative on Monday and recognise &quot; the real situation &quot; of Chechnya &apos;s independence . 
&quot; Russia needs a reliable partner in the Caucasus , not a satellite , &quot; he said . 
he also reiterated the Chechen demand that Moscow pay for the damage wreaked by its troops during the fighting . 
&quot; Russia is obliged by all moral norms to restore what it destroyed , &quot; he said . 
Chechnya puts the total cost of restoring its economy and infrastructure at a staggering $ 260 billion . 
on Sunday Udugov and the Security Council &apos;s secretary , Ivan Rybkin , signed a protocol allowing family members of people missing in Chechnya to play a more active role in trying to locate them . 
Rybkin has said the number of people still missing , including people taken captive during the war , totals 1,407 .
