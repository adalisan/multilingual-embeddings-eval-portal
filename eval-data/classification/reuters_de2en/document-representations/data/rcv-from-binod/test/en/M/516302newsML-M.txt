wall Street stocks are expected to open mixed on Thursday after a rally yesterday which was concentrated in blue chips while the broader market remained mixed . 
analysts said that most of the action will likely once again come during the last hour of trading , when programs are expected to kick in . 
&quot; It &apos;s the same kind of Dow rally we keep seeing again and again , &quot; said Larry Wachtel , analyst at prudential Securities . 
&quot; volatility is a way of life . 
he said that with the addition of new components to the Dow Industrial average , people have grown attuned daily swings of one hundred points or so . 
&quot; Foreign markets don &apos;t show an explosive followthrough . 
the Dow fell 10 percent in less than a month . 
&quot; We are seeing a move into cyclicals like steel , chemicals and autos . 
we are moving away , at least for the time being , from techs . 
it &apos;s a rotational story . 
the opening will also be influenced by February international trade data and weekly jobless claims . 
in Tokyo , the Nikkei average rose 62.21 points , or 0.35 percent , to 18,093.41 . 
U.S. shares were steady to firmer on Thursday following Wall Street &apos;s third straight winning session on Wednesday but trading activity , with the exception of red-hot tobaccos , was light , as investors remained wary about the Dow &apos;s rally . 
Philip Morris COS Inc which jumped $ 4-3 / 8 on Wednesday , accounting for 15 percent or 14 points of the Dow &apos;s gains , was up $ 1 / 4 to $ 43-1 / 2 , while RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp added $ 1 / 8 to $ 33-5 / 8 after a $ 3-1 / 4 spurt in New York . 
Cyrix Corp was up $ 2-1 / 2 to $ 20-1 / 4 in Europe after hitting a high of $ 21 in U.S. after-hours in reaction to the company &apos;s strong first-quarter earnings report . 
elsewhere , Microsoft Corp was up $ 1 / 2 to $ 97-3 / 4 ahead of its third-quarter figures due later on Thursday . 
shares in Gillette Co were shaved $ 3 / 8 lower to $ 81-1 / 2 after soaring over five percent in New York on Wednesday in anticipation of strong first-quarter figures later today . 
the dollar slid against the mark and yen in Tokyo and was in a tight range in Europe . 
U.S. treasuries were mostly higher , with the long bond up 4 / 32 to yield 7.09 percent . 
the Wall Street Journal &apos;s heard on the Street writes that a $ 300 billion pricetag for the tobacco industry to settle its liability for smoking-related damages might seem impossibly expensive , even if stretched out over 25 years . 
yet tobacco stocks shot up yesterday . 
the New York Times Market Place writes that investors have become a little hesitant about committing more cash to Boston Chicken Inc .
