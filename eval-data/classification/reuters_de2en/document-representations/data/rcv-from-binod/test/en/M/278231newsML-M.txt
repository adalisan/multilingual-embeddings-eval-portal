London white sugar finished near the highs on Friday , but business was sluggish with many players absent between Christmas and New Year holidays . 
the benchmark March 1997 contract gained $ 1.10 to $ 307.50 a tonne after climbing to a high of $ 308.10 at one stage . 
total turnover reached 1,106 lots . 
in Paris business was also sluggish , with March gaining $ 0.70 to $ 307.00 . 
total turnover was 594 lots . 
&quot; There &apos;s absolutely nothing going on . 
some people have returned ( from holiday ) but there are still a lot of people away , &quot; said one dealer . 
light trade selling capped the market early on , but stronger raw sugar values in New York gave London a moderate boost . 
traders played down news on Thursday that China was to uphold the ban on imports of sugar for general trade in 1997 . 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation suspended imports of sugar for general trade in 1996 to curb huge losses by the sugar industry after rampant smuggling and oversupply , the Economic Information Daily said . 
&quot; We have seen this kind of thing before , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; The general opinion is that although China is banning these imports there will still be some kind of shipments , be they through smuggling or official channels . 
also on the physical front Turkey &apos;s state sugar refineries , Turkseker , invited bids on Friday for a tender to export up to 50,000 tonnes of white sugar .
