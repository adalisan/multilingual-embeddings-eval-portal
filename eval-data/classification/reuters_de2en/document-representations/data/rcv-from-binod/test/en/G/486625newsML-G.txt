the idea of the likes of Eric Bristow and Jocky Wilson taking their ample frames and darts expertise into South Africa &apos;s townships may be bizarre but it could be about to come to pass . 
the former world darts champions are being encouraged to abandon their fans in the smoke-filled public bars of Britain and instead become icons for would-be darts players in the townships of South Africa . 
in a country where sports &quot; development &quot; is a hot political topic , the unified darts authority -- darts South Africa ( DSA ) -- are launching their own development initiative . 
and they are already negotiating to bring British stars to the Republic &apos;s dusty , ramshackle townships . 
Mervyn Johnson , general secretary of DSA , said : &quot; The image of the game is undergoing a change , not just in South Africa but worldwide , taking it away from the stigma of being associated with liquor . 
&quot; We believe darts could be a way of helping combat the crime and drug problems we have in our communities . 
while higher profile sports such as cricket and rugby are under pressure to take their sport to all sections of the community , darts can already claim to be some way along the road . 
it is already a popular sport among South Africa &apos;s coloured community whose organising body , the South African darts Board of Control ( SADBOC ) united with the white South African darts Association ( SADA ) , to form DSA . 
its leader Johnson has a missionary &apos;s zeal to spread the game throughout his country as well as the rest of Africa and is launching a pilot development scheme in the coloured Cape Town suburb of retreat . 
&quot; We are aiming at children between the ages of 13 and 18 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We want to fit in with the sports policy of South Africa which is to spread sport across the nation irrespective of the so-called racial classifications . 
DSA are also the driving force behind plans to create the first African darts Council . 
delegates from all over the continent met in Johannesburg last week to discuss the plan . 
the sport has 30,000 organised players in South Africa and is played at national representative level in Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Namibia , Swaziland , Zambia , Zimbabwe , Kenya , Seychelles and Uganda . 
Johnson hopes to establish an African Cup , have darts included as a sport in the African Games and launch African players on to the world stage . 
as the excitable TV darts commentator Sid Waddell once famously said : &quot; There may be Shakespeare on the other channel but there &apos;s real drama here .
