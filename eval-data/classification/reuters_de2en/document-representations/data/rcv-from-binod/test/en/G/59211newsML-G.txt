Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani is to meet a senior U.S. official in Turkey , just days after his fighters took control of north Iraq with the backing of Baghdad troops , an Iraqi opposition group said on Tuesday . 
the Iraqi Broadcasting Corporation ( IBC ) said Barzani , head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , would travel to Turkey on Thursday for talks with Robert Pelletreau , the U.S. assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs . 
however , a source close to the talks told Reuters the session could be held in the Turkish town of Silopi , near the Iraqi border , as early as Wednesday . 
we are trying to put it together , &quot; said a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy . 
she did not say who asked for the meeting . 
Barzani &apos;s forces conquered most of northern Iraq last week in fighting with a rival militia led by Jalanl Talabani . 
the clashes shattered a U.S.-brokered ceasefire and boosted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in an area that has been out of his control since a Western no-fly zone was imposed over northern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War . 
&quot; The meeting will be to continue U.S. mediation efforts between Mr Barzani and Mr Jalal Talabani , &quot; the IBC , said in a statement . 
the IBC is a wing of the U.S.-backed Iraqi National Congress group dedicated to Saddam &apos;s overthrow . 
Iraqi troops and tanks helped Barzani capture a key Kurdish city last month , prompting U.S. missile strikes on Iraq . 
a new U.S. attack on Iraq appeared uncertain in the face of Baghdad &apos;s retreat from confrontation and a dearth of diplomatic support for President Bill Clinton &apos;s tough line toward Saddam . 
the U.S. nuclear-powered submarine Pittsburgh was passing through the Suez Canal on Tuesday en route to join other American forces in the Gulf . 
the United States helped around 2,500 pro-U.S. Kurds flee northern Iraq in fear of Saddam last weekend in an acknowledgement that Washington had lost much of its leverage in the mountainous region . 
Baghdad &apos;s involvement in the Kurdish infighting has raised questions on the effectiveness of a U.S.-led air force in Turkey set up in 1991 to protect the Kurds from any Iraqi attack . 
the Kurdish-held north was opened to traffic and goods from the Arab south of Iraq after a five-year break following Barzani &apos;s victory . 
but Barzani , a veteran of a decades-old guerrilla war for Kurdish autonomy from Baghdad , has not announced any definite political deal with Saddam . 
Western diplomats say the Kurdish chieftain might still be open to U.S. calls not to get too close to the Iraqi leader . 
officials were scrambling to put together the meeting , but a Turkish newspaper reported that Barzani would hold talks with Turkish officials in the border town of Silopi on Thursday for talks on tightening border security . 
&quot; It is true . 
he is coming at his own request , &quot; Interior Minister Mehmet Agar told journalists . 
Turkey says instability in northern Iraq plays into the hands of its own separatist Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which maintains bases there , but Ankara has yet to unveil details of a proposed security zone in northern Iraq . 
much of the Arab world has criticised Turkey for its plan to establish a buffer zone of up to six miles ( 10 km ) into Iraqi territory .
