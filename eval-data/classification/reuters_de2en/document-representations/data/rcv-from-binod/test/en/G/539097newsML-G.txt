Cambodia &apos;s chiefs of defence and law and order on Friday eased fears of a violent resolution to the country &apos;s political crisis , pledging to avoid bloodshed and remain neutral in the row between rival government leaders . 
Co-Interior Minister SAR Kheng , speaking after a meeting of eight top officials from both parties in the ailing coalition government , the Cambodian People &apos;s Party ( CPP ) and the royalist FUNCINPEC , said the order would be given to senior soldiers , police and civil servants from around the nation at a meeting on Tuesday . 
&quot; We hope and believe that after this meeting and the meeting on April 29 , we can solve the situation in Cambodia , especially the political situation , &quot; he said , acknowledging that foreign diplomats , tourists and investors were concerned . 
SAR Kheng told reporters the four CPP and four FUNCINPEC officials at Friday &apos;s meeting had been instructed by feuding co-Premiers Hun Sen of the CPP and Prince Norodom Ranariddh of FUNCINPEC , to meet in a bid to ease political tension and curb the risk of violence between rival armed forces . 
ties between Hun Sen and Ranariddh have been strained for some time . 
&quot; The eight of us fully agreed to completely avoid confrontation with weapons , &quot; SAR Kheng said after the meeting , adding that the police , army and civil service should stay out of the war of words between the co-premiers . 
he said it was their &quot; historic duty &quot; to take measures to prevent the country from heading into disaster , adding that the two parties had agreed to take steps to avoid any acts of terrorism . 
tension between the two parties has soared since a deadly March 30 grenade attack on a demonstration led by opposition leader and FUNCINPEC ally , Sam Rainsy . 
relations hit a new low last week when Hun Sen said the CPP had backed a challenge to Ranariddh &apos;s leadership of FUNCINPEC , from royalist dissidents . 
the news sparked rumours of an imminent coup .
