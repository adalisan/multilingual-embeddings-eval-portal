European bourses ended the day well down on Friday with investors worried about political uncertainties in Britain and France , and unsettled by a poor performance on Wall Street . 
on currency markets , the dollar perked up against the mark and strengthened against the yen in late trade . 
it had weakened against the yen for most of the session as the suspension of a major Japanese insurer prompted speculation about higher interest rates in Tokyo . 
London and Paris , both facing general elections in coming weeks , made moderate losses at the close but Frankfurt suffered the most , its computerised IBIS index tumbling over one percent in final trading . 
&quot; It &apos;s the end of the week , everyone &apos;s tired and wants to go home , &quot; said a dealer in London . 
a weak showing on Wall Street -- it was down 0.75 percent as Europe closed -- and strong British first quarter growth figures depressed London prices and added to concerns over near-term interest rate rises . 
London &apos;s FTSE index ended with losses of 0.43 percent amid a background of doubt over the outcome of May 1 elections in which the Conservative government is expected to be ousted by the opposition Labour party , according to opinion polls . 
dealers and strategists said Friday morning &apos;s GDP figures added more weight to the case for higher near-term interest rates . 
a rate rise soon after the poll is anticipated whoever comes to power . 
&quot; The figures mean four percent annualised growth which is pretty strong growth , well above trend and reinforces the likelihood of rate increases soon , &quot; said Credit Lyonnais Laing economist , Andrew Smith . 
the Paris bourse made hefty losses in thin morning trade with many investors holding back amid election uncertainty , but recovered some poise to finish down only a few points . 
&quot; We &apos;re waiting for the polls and for the election , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; The polls are being closely watched but they have a very short term impact . 
an ipsos poll showing the ruling conservative coalition would get a wafer-thin majority weighed on the French financial markets . 
&quot; Investors will steer clear until the election . 
the risk , in terms of market valuation , is too great . 
better wait a month and find out what France &apos;s direction will be , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; Until then , we &apos;ll be driven by the polls . 
Frankfurt had the worst day . 
floor trade ended down 0.6 percent but dealings in the after-hours computerised IBIS index fell by 1.15 percent at the finish as investors pocketed profits before the weekend . 
market interest focused on the construction sector after builders Holzmann AG and Hochtief AG both said they were pulling out of Germany &apos;s high-speed rail Transrapid project because of questions about the project &apos;s costs . 
in currencies , more buoyant dollar sentiment pulled the U.S. currency above 1.72 marks towards the end of the session and helped it on the yen . 
traders said the dollar had been nudged down a bit too far for comfort against the yen and mark this week despite its underlying strength , and that position adjustment was going ahead before this wekend &apos;s meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised countries . 
&quot; The dollar was looking a bit oversold and we &apos;d taken out a very short-term downtrend , &quot; said Norman Beauchamp , head of derivatives trading at the Cooperative Bank in London . 
&quot; Now that we &apos;ve broken out of that trend , we &apos;re heading towards the 1.7250-marks area , &quot; Beauchamp said . 
the mark had gained on other European currencies because of renewed worries over European monetary union and next month &apos;s French elections , and this had led to selling of European currencies against the dollar as well , they said . 
&quot; When there &apos;s nervousness over EMU the market tends to sell European currencies for marks . 
but it seems they &apos;re selling them against the dollar as well today , since they want both dollars and marks ahead of the G7 , &quot; said one trader at a U.S. bank here . 
the dollar recovered against the yen after earlier weakness over anxiety about a rise in Japanese market interest rates overnight because of renewed worries over Japan &apos;s financial industry . 
the anxiety was prompted by the suspension of the big Japanese insurance company Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Company . 
this triggered concern that Nissan &apos;s foreign bonds would be liquidated , causing a large repatriation of funds . 
the Paris CAC-40 index closed down 3.37 points at 2536.26 . 
the dollar stood at 1.7256 against the mark in late trade versus 1.7150 on Thursday . 
against the yen , the dollar was quoted at 126.10 from 125.90 . 
gold closed at $ 342.50 an ounce after ending at $ 340.65 in 
London on Thursday . 
silver was at $ 4.73 , one cent higher .
