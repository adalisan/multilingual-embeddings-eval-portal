rising heating oil demand and ice-blocked German waterways boosted NWE gas oil premiums as Europe shivered in freezing temperatures on Monday , traders said . 
&quot; German demand is enormous . 
ice ( in some of the waterways ) is affecting the market there , &quot; one trader said . 
heating oil barge premiums rose 50 cents to trade at Jan IPE + $ 1.50 on delivery delays caused by the iced-up German barge channels with further rises expected if forecasted cold weather continues and wholesalers need to replenish storage . 
most German heating oil is moving on road and rail in view of the barge delays . 
&quot; My feeling is 0.2 is going to strengthen later in the week on the cold weather . 
but low sulphur is dead , &quot; a trader said . 
benchmark Jan IPE futures closed 75 cents up at $ 223.50 a tonne buoyed by the cold weather across Europe . 
heating oil cargo premiums rose 50 cents to $ 1 to Jan IPE + $ 5.50 / 6.50 on increased demand .
