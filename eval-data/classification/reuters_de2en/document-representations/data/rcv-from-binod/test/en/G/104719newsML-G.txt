the IRA said on Wednesday that a man shot dead during a police raid on a London house was one of its members . 
Diarmiud O &apos;Neill , 27 , was shot several times when he opened the door of his west London apartment after hearing a commotion in the corridor outside . 
he was unarmed . 
five other suspects were arrested in the raids in which 10 tonnes of explosives and several weapons were seized . 
&quot; We confirm that Diarmuid O &apos;Neill , shot dead by British police at Hammersmith on 23 September , was one of our volunteers , &quot; the Irish Republican Army said in a statement . 
&quot; To his family and relatives , we offer our sincere condolences . 
we have delayed confirmation that Diarmuid was one of our volunteers in respectful consideration of his parents &apos; publicly expressed request for privacy at the burial of their son , &quot; it said . 
o &apos;Neill was buried in his home village of Timoleague in Ireland last week . 
he did not receive the traditional IRA send-off of a volley of gun shots over a tricolour-draped coffin , but at least one senior IRA figure was reported to have been at the funeral . 
the raid was believed to have struck a severe blow to the IRA &apos;s campaign to end British rule of Northern Ireland and police said it revealed the guerrillas were planning imminent bomb attacks in London . 
on Monday , the IRA bombed the British army &apos;s headquarters in Northern Ireland in its first attack in the province since it called off a 17-month ceasefire in February .
