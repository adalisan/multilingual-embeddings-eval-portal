Pakistan &apos;s Jamaat-i-Islami party said on Thursday police had arrested 600 of its activists to stop an anti-government demonstration the fundamentalist islamic group plans to hold in Islamabad on Sunday . 
Jamaat chief Qazi Hussain Ahmad told a news conference his group would go ahead with plans to hold a massive sit-in before parliament as part of its campaign against prime minister Benazir Bhutto . 
he said most of the 600 arrests had been made in the past few days in the central province of Punjab and the north west frontier province bordering Afghanistan . 
no government figure for the arrests was immediately available . 
but interior minister Naseerullah Babar said in a statement all arrested people would be released if the Jamaat agreed to shift the venue of the sit-in , for which it has vowed to bring a million people , to a park in nearby Rawalpindi city . 
Ahmed said the Jamaat leadership had rejected Babar &apos;s demand as well as a suggestion by President Farooq Leghari that the sit-in be held somewhere else in Islamabad rather than in front of the parliament . 
the assembly building is close to the presidential palace , prime minister &apos;s house , other major government buildings and the exclusive diplomatic enclave . 
Babar said the government had not allowed political rallies in the newly-built capital in past and did not want to set a precedent for the future . 
government officials say they fear the arrival of a large number of Jamaat activists , many of whom are said to be trained in the use of weapons , could spark violence . 
Ahmed dismissed the fear saying party workers were under strict orders not to bring weapons . 
at leasts three people were killed and 60 injured in gun battles last June in Rawalpindi when police stopped Jamaat workers there to prevent them from marching to Islamabad for a similar anti-government demonstration .
