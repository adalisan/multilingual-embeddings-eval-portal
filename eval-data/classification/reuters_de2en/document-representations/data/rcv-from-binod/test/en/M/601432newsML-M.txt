South African stocks ended up on Wednesday amid wide relief that the Federal Reserve had decided to hold United States interest rates steady , with Liberty Life and Sasol both seeing healthy gains . 
the rates decision on Tuesday came as a pleasent surprise to most market players as speculation had been rife for a 25 basis point rise . 
South African shares joined in a global rising trend , but the gains were capped by a report from the World Economic Forum that raised competitiveness fears on South Africa due to its high crime rate and labour relations . 
the all-share index added 21.0 points to 7,127.2 as industrials put on 24.2 points to finish at 8,396.2 . 
volumes , however , were muted as only 575 million rands worth of shares changed hands . 
&quot; The gains came in the first few minutes of trade and we held onto them for the rest of day , &quot; one dealer said . 
notable stock movements included asset swaps worth almost 50 million rand in chemicals to oils group Sasol Ltd . traders said broking firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell had done one deal in 300,000 shares , with BOE Natwest responsible for two further transactions in a total of 520,000 shares . 
Sasol , which also saw several bookover deals , ended up 125 cents to 55.25 rand with more than 1.4 million shares worth 78.9 million rands being traded . 
financial group Liberty Life Association Ltd ended up 125 cents to 131.00 rand after the market welcomed a bullish investors roadshow held after the market closed on Tuesday . 
another blue chip that saw heavy gains was Amplats which rose 130 cents to 31.00 rand on news that talks on restructuring the group and the merger of its four existing companies into one were proceeding well . 
smaller stocks catching the market &apos;s eye included Tigon Ltd , up 120 cents to 425 cents , as it clawed back some of its enormous recent losses following the Johannesburg Stock Exchange &apos;s decision to temporarily suspend the shares over the accounting of the firm &apos;s 1996 financial results . 
shares in clothing retailer Foschini Ltd , damaged by a recent poor earnings announcement from rival Edgars Ltd , also launched a recovery . 
they ended up 75 cents at 14.25 cents . 
as recently as May 5 the firm &apos;s share was trading as high as 17.60 rand . 
the gold sector got off to a good start , but renewed jitters on the bullion price saw the gains evaporate in the afternoon . 
the golds index gained 0.4 points to 1,213.7 . 
however , the bullion price was still fixed firmly above the psychologically important $ 340 an ounce level . 
dealers said the overall market was set to drift sideways over the coming days as players tried to ignore U.S. trends . 
most funds are desperate for new data on the local economy , but a dearth of figures has left the market directionless . 
&quot; We should move sideways to slightly up . 
the market is really looking for some local figures rather than international news , &quot; said James Scott , equity marketing manager at Societe Generale Frankel Pollak . 
South African April trade balance is expected in the second half of this week , but the more closely watched figure will be the consumer inflation number due next week . 
Near-dated futures also had a good day , posting healthy gains in the morning that held throughout the day . 
the near dated June all-share contract was at 6,540 / 45 from 6,535 as industrials ticked up to 8,190 / 98 from 8,178 . 
gold contracts were steady at 843 / 45 from 857 .
