freed-up milling wheat prices of the Budapest commodity Exchange took the expected leap on Tuesday and turnover surged to the highest level in a month due to short covering , traders said . 
&quot; Traders expected a rise , but the size of it surprised most of us , &quot; said Robert Monostori of Agrimpex . 
the daily allowed movement limit for grains futures is 400 forints per tonne on the BCE , and after three consecutive days of limit moves , prices are freed up . 
January and March milling wheat were freed up on Friday and opened a gap of some 3,000 forints compared with all other maturities that were freed up today . 
accordingly , the August position rose 1,430 forints to 23,900 , October 2,200 forints to 25,950 and May rose to 27,460 , up 780 . 
Monostori said many traders were desperate to cover short positions as financing them was growing too difficult . 
he added , however , that milling wheat prices were somewhat overheated and quality worries that had pushed prices up some 3,000 forints over the last 10 days might be exaggerated . 
&quot; Even if the quality of the ( wheat ) crop will be lower than usual , the rise was not entirely warranted , &quot; Monostori said . 
&quot; And actual quality could turn out to be better than originally feared . 
other grains remained little traded on Tuesday as milling wheat stole the show , but price movements confirmed most traders &apos; predictions . 
most feed barley prices went limit-up as the small barley market tends to follow milling wheat price movements . 
feed wheat was mixed but prices remained some 6,000 to 8,000 forints below corresponding milling wheat prices . 
maize futures prices showed a modest upward correction after expectations of a good crop had pushed them down over the last few days . 
total grains turnover surged to one billion forints or 2,012 contracts from Monday &apos;s 221.4 million forints or 481 lots . 
milling wheat accounted for most of the day &apos;s turnover with 1,812 contracts . 
( lot size = 20,000 kgs $ = 193.38 Hungarian forints )
