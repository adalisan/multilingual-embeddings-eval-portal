a jury with a majority of whites was sworn in on Thursday in the O. J. Simpson civil trial to decide if the former football star was responsible for the murders of his ex-wife and her friend . 
following almost a month of questioning of more than 200 potential jurors , Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki seated the 12-person panel , with whites making up the largest proportion . 
he told them opening arguments would begin next Tuesday . 
the jury consisted of seven white people , two blacks , one Hispanic and another of mixed white and Hispanic heritage and one born in Jamaica who is part Asian and part black . 
seven are women and five men . 
the questioning continued later on Thursday as the judge sought to choose eight alternates who could take over if any of the jurors dropped out for health or other reasons . 
Simpson , who was acquitted by a predominantly black jury at a criminal trial last year of murdering his ex-wife , Nicole Brown , and her friend , Ronald Goldman , was in court on Thursday for the culmination of a process to choose the jury that will decide the case . 
he has been sued by the families of the victims and if found responsible for the murders could be forced to pay millions of dollars in damages . 
the racial makeup of the jury could be crucial as opinion polls since the criminal trial have consistently showed an America divided over the verdict , with most blacks believing in Simpson &apos;s innocence and a majority of whites thinking he got away with murder . 
Simpson is black , the victims were white . 
the responses of potential jurors during questioning by lawyers for both sides tended to bear out this racial polarisation in attitudes . 
during Thursday &apos;s morning session , at which lawyers on both sides were allowed to make peremptory challenges against potential jurors , Simpson &apos;s team called for a mistrial charging the plaintiffs were targeting blacks to be excused from the panel . 
&quot; They are systematically excluding African-American jurors and they &apos;re not permitted to do that , &quot; said Robert Blasier , a member of Simpson &apos;s defence team . 
but Judge Fujisaki denied the oral motion , saying : &quot; I find no basis on which to find the plaintiff has exercised challenges on the basis of race .
