CBOT soy product futures followed soybeans to modest gains early Tuesday , floor traders said . 
strength in soyoil futures also stemmed from ideas that the market was severely oversold . 
all soyoil months made new contract lows on Monday . 
support in soymeal futures was also said to come from crushing data for May from the U.S. census Bureau . 
on Tuesday the census reported soymeal stocks totalled 256,527 tons . 
that figure came in far below the trade average expectation of 315,250 tons . 
Soyoil stocks totalled 2.143 billion lbs , above an average estimate for 2.112 billion lbs . 
gains in both markets should continued to be limited by prospects for a large 1997 / 98 ( Aug / Sep ) soybean crop . 
weather in the U.S. Midwest remains favorable for early development . 
at 1009 CDT , July soyoil was 0.04 cent a lb higher at 22.79 , and other months were 0.03 to 0.15 higher . 
July soymeal was $ 0.80 higher at $ 274.50 , and other months were $ 0.80 to $ 1.80 higher .
