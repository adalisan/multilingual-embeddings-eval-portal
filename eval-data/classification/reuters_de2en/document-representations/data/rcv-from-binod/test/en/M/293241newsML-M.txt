CEZ , Komercni Banka , Chemopetrol and Ceska Sporitelna all gained ground to boost the PX50 index 3.1 points , or 0.57 percent , to 550.4 .

tobacco company Tabak continued its uptrend with a 43 crown gain to 7,050 . 
brewers Prazske Pivovary and Pivovar Radegast both record strong sessions , rising 55 crowns and 83 crowns respectively on the heels of British brewer bass &apos;s announcement that it had increased its stake in Radegast by 10 percent to 33 percent . 
bass &apos;s Czech country manager , Mervyn Childs , said the British firm wants to further raise its stake in Radegast and set up a possible merger with Prazske in which it holds a majority stake . 
&quot; In the medium to longer term we would like to increase our stake ( in Radegast ) but we &apos;ll do that hopefully through discussion and agreement with other major shareholders , &quot; Childs told Reuters . 
&quot; In the medium to longer term yes we would like to consider a merger of Radegast and Prague breweries group , &quot; he added . 
analysts said bass &apos;s announcement could push both issues higher in the coming weeks , as investors look to cash in on bass &apos;s hunger to expand in the sector . 
&quot; bass appears to be serious about raising its stakes , especially in Radegast , and this could add as much as five percent to its share price , &quot; said one analyst .
