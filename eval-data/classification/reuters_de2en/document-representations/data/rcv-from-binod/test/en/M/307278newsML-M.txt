the Malaysian ringgit saw another volatile session on Tuesday , coming under pressure as short-term speculators took profit on its recent sharp gains against the dollar . 
dealers said some funds were also looking at other currencies , particularly the rupiah , for higher yield . 
&quot; The ringgit has risen by over two percent in one week . 
there has to be some profit-taking , correction , &quot; said the head of foreign exchange dealing at a European bank in Singapore . 
he said the ringgit was likely to consolidate around the 2.4850 region over the next few days . 
the ringgit hit a 17-month high of 2.4660 / 70 a dollar on Monday against 2.5250 at the start of the year . 
but dealers said the ringgit &apos;s overall uptrend remained intact as funds would continue to be attracted by the country &apos;s strong fundamentals . 
&quot; Dollar / ringgit came down quite rapidly over the new year and I think those who had gone short want to cover back because they &apos;re afraid the central bank might say it &apos;s been too rapid a rise for the ringgit , &quot; said a Japanese bank dealer in Singapore . 
he said players were likely to return to the ringgit towards the 2.4850-2.4900 levels . 
across the border , the Singapore dollar was stuck within a tight 1.4030-1.4060 trading band , despite some profit-taking in the ringgit / sing cross . 
dealers said the U.S. dollar looked supported around S $ 1.4030 / 40 , where bidding by local banks had generated some talk of central bank intervention . 
the Monetary Authority of Singapore , the de facto central bank , typically intervenes in forex markets through major local banks . 
but the Japanese bank dealer said 1.4040 was also a technical support level for the U.S. dollar . 
the Indonesian rupiah calmed down after a volatile overnight session , which saw it fall sharply in London markets on fears that a much-expected band widening would fail to materialise as the central bank raised its fixing again on Monday . 
some dealers said spot rupiah fell to a low of 2,383.0 in London overnight while others said the low was 2,379.0 . 
they attributed the sharp fall from Friday &apos;s low of 2,359.0 to stop-loss covering by offshore operators . 
&quot; Many offshore players were forced to cover because of the stop-loss limit . 
this triggered the sharp rupiah fall overnight , &quot; a U.S. bank dealer said in Jakarta said . 
spot rupiah was quoted at 2,372.0 / 73.0 at 0435 GMT against an opening of 2,369.5 / 71.0 . 
its low was 2,374.0 . 
&quot; The ( dollar ) shorts got nervous . 
and with Singapore and Jakarta closed in London time , there were only a couple of banks quoting five rupiah spreads for $ 10 million , &quot; said the Japanese bank dealer in Singapore . 
but he said the rupiah stabilised around the 2,368 / 73 region for the rest of the London session . 
&quot; From this morning , it just carried forward from the 2,370 level but 2,373.00 / 75.00 looks toppish at the moment , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The band widening talk seems to have subsided . 
offshore operators started speculating heavily last Friday that the central bank was set to widen its band . 
the speculation triggered heavy dollar selling because any band widening in the past had caused the rupiah to strengthen . 
the Thai baht slipped in line with the dollar &apos;s firmer tone against the majors , but dealers said its weakness was limited by some selling of the dollar . 
the baht was quoted at 25.645-25.650 to the dollar at 0435 GMT against 25.630-25.635 late on Monday . 
the Bank of Thailand fixed the baht / dollar mid-rate at 25.66 against 25.65 on Monday . 
dealers said the overnight interbank rate could ease if dollar sales in the forex market persisted but demand for funds to meet value-added tax payments would prevent a sharp drop .
