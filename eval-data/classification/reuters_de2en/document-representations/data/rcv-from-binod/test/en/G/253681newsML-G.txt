labour deputy leader Michael Cullen said on Thursday he believed an &quot; off the record &quot; deal had been struck between National and NZ First over resourcing NZ First . 
but Justice Minister Doug Graham said he was not aware of any such arrangement . 
on Wednesday , NZ First and the conservative National Party signed a coalition deal after eight weeks of negotiations . 
NZ First held the balance of power after the October 12 election and negotiated separately with both Labour and National before opting for National on Tuesday . 
Cullen said the non-policy parts of the deal were very similar to the one handed to Labour and drafted by NZ First leader Winston Peters &apos; brother Wayne . 
&quot; This agreement has scarcely been changed from the original draft . 
except one large interesting section that has been dropped out completely ( covering ) resourcing of NZ First , &quot; Cullen told Reuters . 
there is a massive off record deal there which we could never match . 
Cullen said he would not say what it involved &quot; but I might in the House tomorrow &quot; . 
justice Minister Doug Graham , who was a key negotiator of the agreement , refused to discuss whether funding for NZ First arose during the negotiations . 
he said there were no arrangements &quot; off balance sheet &quot; that he was aware of . 
&quot; Not what you are getting at . 
nothing of importance . 
no , there are none . 
unless the prime minister has done it off his own bat , &quot; Graham said . 
Cullen also said he was convinced nationalist New Zealand First &apos;s caucus did not get a true account of Labour &apos;s offer before making its choice of a coalition partner . 
&quot; I think Winston made up his mind before he went in there . 
&quot; I am now absolutely convinced that our position on a number of key issues was misrepresented in the last stages of their caucus , &quot; Cullen said . 
Cullen said NZ First came back to Labour on Tuesday with a final offer of four seats in the cabinet when Labour had already offered six .
