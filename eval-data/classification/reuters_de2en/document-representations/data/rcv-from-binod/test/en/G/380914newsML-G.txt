tens of thousands of mourners gathered in a sea of white funeral flags in southern Sri Lanka &apos;s Ratnapura on Saturday for the funeral of a politician gunned down earlier in the week . 
Tuesday &apos;s killing of Nalanda Ellawala , a local legislator from the ruling People &apos;s Alliance , during a roadside quarrel with opposition supporters sparked riots for two days that saw angry mobs set fire to scores of buildings . 
police said pro-People &apos;s Alliance mobs had set fire to homes and buildings of supporters of the main opposition United National Party ( UNP ) . 
no one was hurt in the riots . 
police named two suspects in the killing , UNP lawmaker Susantha Punchinilame and Mahinda Ratnatilleke , ex-UNP mayor of Ratnapura , and offered a reward of one million rupees ( $ 17,500 ) to anyone providing information leading to their arrest . 
early on Saturday , a store in Ratnapura was set on fire and a shop attendant died , police said . 
no one was arrested and it was not clear if the incident was related to Ellawala &apos;s killing , police said . 
roads leading to Ratnapura , a gem mining town 80 km ( 50 miles ) southeast of Colombo , were choked with traffic , police said . 
all shops were closed and the streets were lined with hundreds of police and army personnel . 
by Saturday afternoon , the mourners were quietly lined up outside the town hall under a hot sun to pay their last respects to Ellawala , 29 , scion of an influential political family and the youngest member of Sri Lanka &apos;s parliament . 
&quot; We estimate about 100,000 people have gathered here for the funeral , &quot; Inspector D. Dayananda of Ratnapura police told Reuters . 
&quot; The crowd might grow towards the afternoon . 
the killing came the day before a deadline for filing nominations in the March 21 local elections , the first electoral contest between the UNP and the People &apos;s Alliance since 1994 when the alliance ousted the UNP . 
more than 18,000 candidates from 12 political parties , including the alliance , the UNP and 132 independent groups , will take part in the polls for 238 local government bodies , the Elections Department said . 
the UNP suspended the party memberships of the two suspects , a day after party leader and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called on the two to turn themselves in .
