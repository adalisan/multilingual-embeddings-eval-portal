the U.S. government , which has preferred reaching a global ban on anti-personnel landmines in the U.N. disarmament body , is studying whether to sign up to a fast-track initiative by Canada , a U.S. envoy said on Thursday . 
but Katharine Crittenberger , acting head of the U.S. delegation to the Conference on Disarmament ( CD ) , also said that Washington would still pursue a global treaty in U.N. talks . 
Western diplomats said the imminent policy decision was in the hands of President Bill Clinton , who is due to start holiday soon . 
&quot; The question is being reviewed now . 
but the notion of comprehensiveness and globality can only be addressed here , &quot; Crittenberger told Reuters . 
&quot; No matter what is decided on Ottawa , we would still pursue steps here . 
Clinton , in a message to the CD last January , urged delegates to quickly negotiate a global landmines ban , saying the weapons caused terrible suffering to innocent civilians . 
John Holum , director of the U.S. arms control and disarmament agency , said in Geneva last May that Washington would not sign any accord which emerged from the Ottawa process as key states were not expected to be covered by the pact . 
both China and Russia -- major global producers and users of landmines -- are among the 61 member states of the Geneva forum , but neither is participating in the Canadian effort . 
therefore , Western diplomats said , an effective , truly global ban can be reached only through negotiations in the multilateral forum , which has clinched pacts banning underground nuclear blasts and chemical weapons in recent years . 
the possibility of a U.S. swing to Canada &apos;s initiative emerged amid growing acceptance that the Geneva body will be unable to launch negotiations before the CD ends its final 1997 session in mid-September . 
&quot; Obviously , we &apos;re not getting anything here this year , &quot; grumbled one Western delegate . 
non-aligned states are blamed for blocking progress in the CD by linking work on landmines to a demand for total nuclear disarmament . 
the five nuclear weapon states ( Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States ) have refused . 
John Campbell , Australia &apos;s disarmament ambassador who serves as the CD &apos;s special coordinator on landmines , conceded in his &quot; progress report &quot; on Thursday that there was little hope of launching negotiations in Geneva this year . 
&quot; Other delegations pointed out , and this is view that I share personally , that there is little point in the CD taking any decisions on a possible mandate on landmines until the outcome of the Ottawa process is known in December , &quot; he said . 
the Ottawa process is scheduled to sponsor decisive talks in Oslo next month where the Canadian government aims to finalise a landmines ban to be signed in its capital in December . 
U.S. delegates attended previous Ottawa round sessions in Brussels and Vienna as observers , but Washington is reviewing how to handle the Oslo round . 
&quot; We &apos;re told that the decision has gone all the way up to the President and he is going on holiday tomorrow , &quot; one Western diplomat said . 
&quot; We expect a decision any day . 
&quot; He has to decide whether to send a team to Oslo at all , and if so whether as a participant or an observer . 
if one is going to Oslo , it is recognised that it makes it more difficult in political terms not to sign ( a ban ) , &quot; he added . 
in any case , international momentum is inexorably building to ban the weapons , which are blamed for causing 25,000 deaths year , mainly civilians , and maiming many more . 
the effort has been boosted by images of Britain &apos;s Princess Diana consoling civilian victims of the indiscriminate weapons in Bosnia last week . 
her crusade began in Angola last January .
