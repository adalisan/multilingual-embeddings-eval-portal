Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) chairman Hans Meyer said in a newspaper interview the central bank has become more liberal , but also that it would continue to weigh both sides of the coin with respect to its monetary policy . 
&quot; There is no question that we have become more liberal . 
we have come to the conclusion that the general economic situation has changed , &quot; Meyer was quoted as saying in the interview . 
an SNB spokesman said the interview , published in Monday &apos;s Financial Times , was conducted on October 14 . 
that was just over two weeks after the SNB lowered its discount rate to 1.00 percent from 1.50 percent , the lowest level in nearly 20 years . 
the cut in the discount was , according to the newspaper , designed to reinforce the central bank &apos;s view that the current low level of interest rates will persist , it said , &quot; for some time to come , &quot; quoting Meyer . 
Swiss economists have said that a too-strong Swiss franc has undesirable implications for the economy , which is still struggling with static growth . 
the Swiss franc has lately come off highs . 
the SNB has also said it will use its monetary policy to counter unwanted gains in the Swiss franc tied to turbulence in European currencies . 
but Meyer implied that even a resurgence of Swiss franc strength need not mean a dramatic worsening for the economy . 
&quot; Keep in mind that we have experienced a strong currency for a very long period of time , &quot; he said . 
he said he saw the situation in the Swiss economy as &quot; difficult &quot; rather than &quot; dramatic . 
Meyer also said that &quot; sooner or later growth must come . 
we have good preconditions , low interest rates and inflation , and a lot of restucturing has been done . 
asked about a possible link between the Swiss franc and the planned Euro currency , due to be phased in with European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , Meyer said only that &quot; one can always adjust to currency inflows if you are convinced that the country in question is following a policy which meets your own convictions . 
&quot; Since it is very hard to establish convictions about the future , there is much to be said for our policy of trying to operate a policy of limited independence , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We are in a difficult situation . 
but it is not desperate , &quot; he said . 
Meyer also noted that even if there are no signs of an imminent pickup in inflation , the SNB cannot be complacent , also with respect to growth in the money aggregates . 
&quot; We have to take a two- to three-year perspective and you cannot totally exclude what happens to the aggregates in the meantime , &quot; he said .
