the London Stock Exchange on Friday said it was proposing to remove a controverial rule that would have allowed publication delays on trades carried out through its electronic order book which is to be launched in October . 
the LSE said that financial services consultants Oliver , Wyman and Co has recommended immediate publication for all trades on execution , and a move to reliance on natural interaction between telephone trading and the order book . 
&quot; The Wyman report concludes that the order book will work better without any formal rules requiring block trades to interact with it , &quot; the LSE said in a statement . 
&quot; The exchange accepts this advice . 
the order-driven system will match buyers and sellers of shares electronically . 
under the exchange &apos;s currency quote-driven system , prices are set by marketmakers . 
it is the only major exchange that employs such a system . 
&quot; The success of the order book system requires a vibrant order book , which has the liquidity and close relationship with the telephone trading market to form the primary price formation mechanism for the market as a whole , &quot; the exchange added . 
the LSE , Europe &apos;s busiest bourse , is still thrashing out the rules under its electronic order-driven system . 
the amended proposals are now being discussed with the Securities and Investments Board , the exchange said . 
eliminating the publication delay is sharp departure from the exchange &apos;s previous position , as it had argued in the past that doing away with the rule would compromise market liquidity . 
the exchange said it would focus on ways to enhance liquidity if necessary &quot; without the complexity of the formal interaction rules which have been under discussion until now . 
the stock exchange had been under pressure by the UK Treasury Select Committee to ensure transparent markets by removing the rule that would allow trade publication delays .
