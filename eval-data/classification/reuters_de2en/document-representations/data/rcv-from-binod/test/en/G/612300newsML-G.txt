shots were fired on Friday at a police car that was part of a convoy escorting Albania &apos;s long-exiled King Leka into the town of Tropoje , a spokesman said on Saturday . 
Leka did not view the attack as an assasination attempt , the spokesman added 
two men shot at the lead police car of the convoy as it entered the town and Leka &apos;s bodyguards quickly jumped out and caught one of them . 
Leka later ordered that the attacker be released . 
it was the first time Leka had been involved in a violent incident since beginning a tour of the country to persuade people to vote for a return of the monarchy in a referendum due on June 29 . 
Leka fled Albania in 1939 when he was two days old with his father King Zog when Italian fascist troops invaded the country . 
he returned for the first time in 1993 .
