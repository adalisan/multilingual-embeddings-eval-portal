German gold traders said the bullion price remained vulnerable after its fall to 12-year lows but German investor interest was muted because of the strong dollar versus the mark . 
&quot; Asian buyers are taking advantage of the low price but physical demand here for coins and bullion is limited , &quot; said a trader at a bank dealing in sales to small investors . 
&quot; The picture may be slightly different in the professional and speculative trade . 
he pegged gold in a short-term trading range of $ 321-327 an ounce . 
it was last at $ 324.50-324.90 compared with Thursday &apos;s low of $ 323.70 , the lowest since early December 1985 . 
private investors were having to pay around 599 marks per ounce for bullion but this compared with 575 marks just before Christmas 1996 when the gold price was around $ 370 . 
the dollar has meanwhile risen from 1.58 to 1.75 marks , erasing most of the potential gold price savings . 
annual turnover in the German bar / coin market is estimated at 50 tonnes . 
other traders saw the gold price under further pressure from more central bank sales , which they said would be the result of budgetary problems in western Europe . 
&quot; But a certain amount of central bank selling is normal to keep the market supplied , &quot; another trader said . 
&quot; Annual demand of 3,000 tonnes corresponds with just 2,500 tonnes of new mine production . 
Bundesbank sales of gold reserves have been ruled out for the time being . 
&quot; The government is worried about the flight out of the mark ahead of the introduction of the euro , &quot; one said . 
but the market was seen underpinned by the threat of mine closures if prices become too unattractive .
