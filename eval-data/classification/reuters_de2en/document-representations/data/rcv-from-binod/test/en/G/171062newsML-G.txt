the latest political challenge to Australia &apos;s world-first voluntary euthanasia law resumed on Wednesday when parliament re-opened a debate on a bill aimed at overturning the law in the country &apos;s remote Northern Territory . 
government politician Kevin Andrews , with Prime Minister John Howard &apos;s backing , has moved a private motion to have the national government use its constitutional powers to quash the territory law . 
the voluntary euthanasia law came into effect in July and has been used once , by a cancer-stricken man in September . 
the motion is expected to pass the lower house , the House of Representatives , in the next few weeks . 
but its fate in the upper house Senate , expected to vote early next year , is less certain . 
under Australia &apos;s constitution the national government can override laws in the country &apos;s two territories , but not its six states . 
the controversial law allows terminally ill patients to kill themselves with a lethal injection or pills if they meet strict conditions . 
but ongoing legal and political wrangles delayed the use of the law until September , with doctors uncertain about their legal liability if the law was later overturned . 
former carpenter and one-time Christian missionary Bob dent , 66 , became the first person in the world to die under the law when he gave himself a fatal injection at his home in the territory capital , Darwin , on September 22 . 
about 10 people have asked dent &apos;s doctor , euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke , to help them gain clearance to use the voluntary euthanasia law , fearing it will be overturned . 
the law has been condemned by Australia &apos;s political and religious leaders and aboriginal and medical groups , but opinion polls show 75 percent of Australians back the right to die . 
in addition to the anti-euthanasia bill , the law also faces a constitutional challenge in the country &apos;s peak court , the High Court , later this month .
