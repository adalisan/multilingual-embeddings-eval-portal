Middle East peace worries again depressed Jordanian stocks on Saturday , keeping many investors on the sidelines and almost paralysing trading , dealers said . 
the Amman Financial Market 60-share index fell 0.20 percent to 146.93 points from 147.22 points on Wednesday . 
two stocks , including Middle East Hotels which owns the Commodore Hotel , posted new 1996 lows . 
brokers said across the board declines were sparked by investors &apos; and floor traders &apos; pessimism , based on fears of a breakdown in Palestinian-Israeli peace talks . 
Industrials dominated in dull trade and most shares fell although there was minimal selling pressure , brokers said . 
livestock and Poultry was the only focus of investor interest with 149,400 shares changing hands , leaving the stock unchanged at 0.600 dinars . 
Bank of Jordan , the target of earlier buying by a key bank shareholder seeking to increase his stake , posted the highest turnover with the stock unchanged at 3.00 dinars . 
Middle East Investment Bank was the sole bank that rose , edging up 0.010 dinars to 1.040 dinars . 
the market has remained in a wait-and-see mood since the recent flareup in violence in Palestinian self-rule areas , and the lack of tangible progress in Israeli-Palestinian peace moves meant a brief rebound lost steam . 
not only the breakdown of Middle East peace talks , but also the delay in implementing a limited oil-for-food deal with Jordan &apos;s biggest trading partner Iraq , have hurt the market . 
the private Pearl Investable Index of the 45 best performing shares on the exchange shed 0.31 percent to 80.73 points , still 15.48 percent down from the same time last year . 
a total of 192,382 shares worth 102,963 dinars changed hands in weak trade in the parallel market .
