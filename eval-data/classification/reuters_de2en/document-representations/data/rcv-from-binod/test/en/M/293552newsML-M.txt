SIMEX Euroyen futures ended higher following a surge in Japanese government bond futures on Wednesday . 
dealers said Euroyen sentiment was bullish as the Bank of Japan was likely to keep interest rates low to support recovery in the economy and also the weak stock market . 
the Nikkei-225 average ended 215.81 points at 18,680.38 prompted by worries over bad loans of companies in the construction , banking and securities sectors . 
&quot; The JGBs and to a lesser extend the Euroyen seems to be getting a boost from the weak Nikkei , &quot; said a dealer with a European bank . 
&quot; But I think Euroyen looks a bit toppish at current levels . 
it is a bit too close to the cash rates , &quot; he said . 
he said he expected to September contract to range between 99.15-99.35 . 
September Euroyen ended at 99.29 against its previous close its IMM close at 99.26 . 
volume was a moderate 9,330 lots . 
March JGBs finished at 124.76 against their open at 124.34 . 
Eurodollar futures ended little changed in dull trade . 
traders say market participants were mostly sidelined ahead of the release of the non-farm payrolls this Friday . 
&quot; The market has been very thin and it is difficult to get trades done , &quot; said one trader . 
he said the undertone of the market was bearish but the market was likely waiting for Friday &apos;s data before taking any action .
