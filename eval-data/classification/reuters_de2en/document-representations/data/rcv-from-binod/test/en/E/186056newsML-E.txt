the Inter-American Development bank said Wednesday it approved a $ 235.5 million loan to Peru to help the country restructure its foreign debt . 
the loan is part of an $ 800 million financing package from the multilateral organizations to help Peru start up its soon- to-be-completed Brady Plan debt restructuring , the bank said . 
the bank said the Brady Plan deal - restructuring the bulk of Peru &apos;s foreign commercial debt - would help reduce this debt by 50 percent . 
last week , the Peruvian government signed a Brady bond accord with its creditors containing the final details for the restructuring of $ 4.4 billion of principal and interest . 
officials said 180 commercial creditors , accounting for 99 percent of the debt included in the agreement , had selected one or more of the options available in the plan &quot; which include Discount bonds , par bonds , front-loaded Interest Rate bonds ( FLIRBS ) and debt buyback . 
economy Minister Jorge Camet has said the cost of the Brady start-up would be financed by the multilaterals &apos; package , Japan &apos;s Eximbank and the Latin American Reserve Fund . 
the Brady restructuring accord will reduce the total commercial debt to around $ 5 billion , according to the government . 
an Economy Ministry official , who asked not to be named , said 30 percent of this would be covered by a debt buyback .
