Asian dollar deposit rates were little changed in featureless trade with most traders sidelined due mainly to an absence of fresh incentives , dealers said on Monday . 
&quot; The market was quiet and featureless in the morning on some position adjustments . 
most people were sitting on the sidelines , reluctant to open or hold new positions on lack of fresh factors , &quot; a local dealer said . 
&quot; But some people are waiting for this Thursday &apos;s release of the ( U.S. May ) retail sales numbers , for fresh clues to market direction , &quot; he said . 
in day-to-day rates , Monday / Tuesday , Tuesday / Wednesday and week-fixed were unchanged from last Fridays &apos;s common 5-5 / 8 5-1 / 2 percent , respectively . 
among longer dates , one-month was unchanged at 5-11 / 16 5-9 / 16 percent , three-months unchanged at 5-13 / 16 5-11 / 16 , nine-months unchanged at 6-1 / 16 5-15 / 16 and twelve-months unchanged at 6-3 / 16 6-1 / 16 percent .
