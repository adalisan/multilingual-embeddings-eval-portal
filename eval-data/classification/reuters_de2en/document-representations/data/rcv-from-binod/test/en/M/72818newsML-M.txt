the Israeli shekel rose mildly against the dollar but weakened slightly against the basket of foreign currencies after the Bank of Israel intervened in the market by buying dollars , dealers said . 
on Monday there was no foreign currency trading in Israel because of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur . 
&quot; The market was very quiet with slightly more conversions of foreign currency into shekels . 
the Bank of Israel had to intervene on a relatively high scale to support the basket , &quot; said Guy Levi at Bank Leumi . 
&quot; Following the intervention the basket traded at the end of the day at 6.99 percent below the slope . 
the rate cut had no real impact on trading today , &quot; he said . 
the Bank of Israel lowered its key lending rate for October by 0.3 percentage point to an annualised nominal rate of 15.5 percent . 
the shekel can trade in a band of seven percent above or below a slope designed to devalue the Israeli currency at six percent a year against a basket of currencies representing Israel &apos;s main trading partners . 
if the shekel-basket exchange rate reaches the lower trading band the central bank intervenes by buying foreign currency . 
the representative rate for the dollar was 3.1730 against 3.1740 on Friday . 
the basket , composed of the dollar , mark , pound sterling , French franc and yen , closed at 3.5532 shekels against 3.5516 on Friday . 
on the crosses the shekel traded against the yen at 2.8911 shekels per 100 yen against 2.8887 on Friday and against the mark at 2.0967 shekels per mark against 2.0943 on Friday . 
in late afternoon the dollar was trading at 3.1730 shekels .
