the United States said on Monday it was &quot; very disappointed &quot; that China vetoed a U.N. plan to monitor disarmament and a ceasefire in Guatemala , which has just ended a 36-year-old civil war . 
all Security Council members except China voted on Friday for a resolution that would have dispatched 155 peacekeepers to Guatemala for three months under a U.N.-brokered peace accord signed on Dec . 29 between the government and leftist rebels . 
but China vetoed the move because of Guatemala &apos;s diplomatic ties with Taiwan , which Beijing considers a renegade province . 
&quot; We were very disappointed ... we thought it was most unfortunate that China used its veto in the Security Council on the question of a ... very small monitoring group in Guatemala , &quot; said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns . 
&quot; We felt it was the obligation of all members of the Security Council to support that process , &quot; Burns told reporters . 
&quot; To introduce an unrelated issue , which is the issue of Taiwan ... into Central America and to penalise the Guatemalan people was unfair and unfortunate , &quot; he said .
