nominal German new crop wheat prices have gained a further 10 marks this week , mostly due to speculative purchases by exporters , brokers said . 
but business had slowed , with farmers and co-operatives busy harvesting their grain amid sunny weather and with the domestic milling industry declining to follow the market higher . 
&quot; Prices will take their lead from quality reports from the French wheat harvest and the level of export tax decided at the weekly EU tender on Thursday , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; The EU is not expected to grant massive volumes given the large quantities of export applications already received for the autumn , &quot; he added . 
Schleswig-Holstein farmers were selling wheat ex-harvest at 240 marks a tonne . 
the Hamburg grain exchange raised its spot bread wheat price ( 220 Hagberg , 12.5 percent protein ) by 2.50 marks to 270.00 and spot feed wheat was at 262.50 . 
German fob levels for new crop wheat were starting at 280 for 12 percent Aug / Sept wheat in the 3,000 lot size . 
a wide range of qualities , shipment sizes and dates up to December were available , with top prices for 10,000 tonnes Sept / Dec 14 percent wheat fob Rostock at 317.50 marks . 
barley prices ex-harvest were steadier with wheat and because sellers had not decided which grains to designate for long-term storage . 
delivered prices of barley were around 230 marks and fob prices between 240 and 260 for Aug / Dec , depending on date and shipment size . 
new crop bread rye was off around 2.50 at 240-245 fob Aug through Dec on a lack of Miller buying . 
feed rye was hard to market due to ergot occurrence .
