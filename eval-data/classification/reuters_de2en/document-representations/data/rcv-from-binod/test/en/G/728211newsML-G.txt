a row between Sydney hotels and the New South Wales state government over a planned city bed tax was put to rest on Tuesday , allowing organisers of the 2000 Olympic Games to get back to signing up major sponsors . 
Games chiefs were forced to put A $ 600 million ( US $ 440 million ) worth of sponsorship deals on hold last month after hoteliers protesting against the new 10 percent accommodation levy refused to guarantee them rooms . 
under a compromise deal announced on Tuesday , Sydney city hotels promised to make 80 percent of their beds available for Olympic needs in return for a phasing-in of the tax . 
&quot; This agreement overcomes a significant problem which had arisen in our preparations for the Games . 
we can now proceed with confidence , &quot; Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games ( SOCOG ) president Michael Knight said . 
SOCOG vice-president John Coates , a lawyer who heads the Australian Olympic Committee , last week launched a defamation action against NSW state treasurer Michael Egan for having suggested that Coates &apos;s opposition to the tax might be motivated by his business links with a company which runs a city hotel . 
under the compromise , SOCOG itself sacrificed some A $ 6 million it had been due to charge as commission for providing clients with hotels . 
the organising body agreed to cut its own commission on rooms from 10 to five percent . 
in return it is able to go ahead with major sponsorship deals which the row had threatened . 
SOCOG officials had said they would have to renegoiate the deals at much lower rates because sponsors could not be guaranteed a room if there were no cooperation from the hotels . 
&quot; Although we &apos;ve had a few difficult months , SOCOG is now in a better position to sign up accommodation than we were at the beginning of the dispute over bed tax between the government and the industry , &quot; Knight , who is also the NSW Olympics minister , said in a statement . 
the SOCOG concession on its own commission was one element in a compromise deal between the hotel industry and the New South Wales government , which is underwriting the cost of staging the Games . 
hoteliers said the deal would save them a total of A $ 40 million . 
in announcing changes to the bed tax legislation , state premier Bob Carr said the hotel levy would be reduced from 10 percent to five percent at the start of the phasing-in period in September , 1997 . 
but he said the reduction would apply only for hotels which sign agreements with SOCOG before the end of the year . 
cruise ships berthing in Sydney during the Olympics will be exempt . 
in addition , serviced apartments will be exempt from the bed tax for stays of 28 days or longer .
