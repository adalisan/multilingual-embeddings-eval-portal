wall Street stocks are expected to open higher Tuesday , following through on Monday &apos;s rally in blue chips and rebound in the high tech sector . 
&quot; We &apos;ll have a firm opening after the kind of close we saw yesterday . 
markets are firm around the world , so it &apos;s just a question of continuing , &quot; said Larry Wachtel , analyst at prudential Securities . 
the Dow Industrials rose 77 points to close at 7008 yesterday in a move powered by a handful of blue chips that sparked a strong run in large cap stocks . 
&quot; The move yesterday was narrow and concentrated in the blue chips , &quot; Wachtel said . 
&quot; Three stocks accounted for half the move in the Dow . 
we got a snapback in the larger techs , and that is important . 
the question is whether we can run the market on a handful of blue chips . 
he said some caution was likely ahead of tomorrow &apos;s congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think people expect a bombshell , but sometimes even a casual remark by Greenspan can send markets tumbling , &quot; Wachtel said . 
analysts say U.S. cable stocks are likely to take a beating after News Corp Ltd announced an alliance with EchoStar Communications Corp DISH.O to offer a subscription television service in the United States that would compete with cable providers .
