Shanghai &apos;s foreign currency B share index fell 3.7 percent on Thursday because of selling in property developers with ties to the Pudong development zone , brokers said . 
a 4.05 percent plunge in the domestic currency A index due to new listings and rumours of more government moves to regulate the markets also helped send B shares lower , they said . 
the B index closed down 2.914 points or 3.70 percent at 75.776 points on volume of 12.001 million shares worth $ 7.272 million . 
brokers said Pudong-related shares looked over-priced following recent rises . 
the A share market was hurt by new listings , which the government is pushing to help soak up liquidity , and a wave of negative rumours , brokers said . 
&quot; On the A share market , new listings sucked up a lot of capital , which is one of the reasons for the poor performance of existing shares these last two days , &quot; the local broker said . 
rumours sweeping the market said the government would announce more steps to stop state firms by speculation and would allow some types of currently non-tradable shares to be listed . 
&quot; Investors were seen selling Pudong shares heavily , especially in Lujiazui , which had risen sharply over the past few months , &quot; said one local broker . 
listed firms with ties to Shanghai &apos;s Pudong New Area , the city &apos;s premier financial and trade development zone , are heavily weighted in the B share index . 
Pudong developer Shanghai Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Development Co ended down $ 0.074 or 5.48 percent to $ 1.276 to become one of the day &apos;s top losers . 
the A index closed down 50.731 points or 4.05 percent at 1,202.283 points on volume of 353.291 million shares worth 4.626 billion yuan . 
&quot; Selling in the A share market made many investors believe there will be negative news soon , which also hurt the confidence of B share investors , &quot; another local broker said . 
of 45 B shares , 37 traded with 28 down , five up and four flat . 
Shanghai Huili Building Material Co was the most actively traded B share as well as the top gainer on speculative buying . 
it rose $ 0.014 or 7.00 percent to $ 0.214 on volume of 1.6 million shares . 
brokers said a rebound is possible in the near future after sharp falls over the past two sessions , but sentiment remains weak . 
investors are now looking towards positive interim results for an excuse to buy following the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule at midnight on Monday , which sparked a rally earlier this year .
