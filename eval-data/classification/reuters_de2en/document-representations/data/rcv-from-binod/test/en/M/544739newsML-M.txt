German shares treaded water for most of bourse trade on Monday , but the DAX share index ended lower as support from a stronger dollar was outweighed by investor scepticism about the viability of further gains . 
a lower close on Wall Street on Friday evening also helped tip the balance against German shares . 
the DAX index , which measures floor trade in 30 blue-chip German shares , ended down 11.04 points , or 0.33 percent , at 3,363.06 points amid poor volumes . 
this was seen as a subdued reaction to the weekend surge of the dollar to 56-month highs against the mark . 
June DAX futures rose early on , but pared gains to trade at 9.5 points at 3,369 later . 
&quot; There is a high degree of scepticism in the market , &quot; said one trader , noting continued concern over a possible U.S.-led credit tightening . 
the dollar is now seen rising , in the mid- to longer-term possibly up to 1.80 marks , after a communique from the Group of Seven at the weekend was interpreted as not expressing dissatisfaction with the current high value of the dollar . 
chemical group Hoechst ended off earlier highs at 67.40 marks , up 1.20 marks , with Bayer AG up 10 pfennigs at 68.20 marks , on the dollar strength . 
Daimler-Benz AG gained earlier on reports of heavy job cuts and a separate British newspaper report of a merger between Airbus and U.S.-based Lockheed . 
Daimler-Benz Aerospace is one of four European partners in the Airbus plane-making consortium . 
London-based equity analysts contacted on Sunday said they were treating the report sceptically . 
Daimler fell sharply to end down 70 pfennigs at 126.75 after the group denied reports that it planned heavy job cuts , saying it saw its staff levels as stable over the coming years . 
Car-maker Volkswagen went ahead in pre-bourse electronic trade , but fell over bourse trade to end down 15.50 marks at 1,070 marks . 
initial gains were prompted by comments by VW &apos;s chairman Ferdinand Piech , who was quoted saying he was aiming to quadruple pre-tax profits by 2000 . 
Piech was quoted in the &quot; Focus &quot; news magazine as saying the group would save costs by reducing the number of basic structures on which future VW cars would be built . 
dealers said the start of dealings in finance , savings and insurance group BHW Holding later today would probably be one of the day &apos;s trading focuses . 
BHW said at the weekend it would be pricing its shares at 26 marks each , towards the top of the range set for the bookbuilding process , and that its issue had been 14.5 times oversubscribed .
