U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sold at $ 68.00 per cwt in light volume , unchanged from Wednesday &apos;s brisk sales , feedlot sources said . 
about 3,500 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area and about 5,000 in Kansas . 
Packer buying interest remained strong despite their having bought most showlists during Wednesday &apos;s hefty sales , the feedlot sources said . 
sales this week at $ 68.00 were steady with the bulk of cattle sold last week . 
fed cattle prices reportedly were buoyed by belief that several packers were short on live inventory , they said . 
several thousand slaughter steers and heifers sold Wednesday were picked up by at least two major packers , suggesting they were cutting &quot; close to the knife , &quot; one Panhandle feedyard manager said . 
fed cattle prices also were underpinned by strong beef demand this week , market sources said . 
beef prices Thursday were quoted up $ 0.28 to $ 0.47 per cwt , with 214 fabricated beef loads sold , USDA said . 
heavyweight choice beef was up $ 0.41 at $ 105.64 , up $ 1.02 since Friday . 
week to date fabricated beef movement was 1,041 loads , down slightly from 1,089 a week ago .
