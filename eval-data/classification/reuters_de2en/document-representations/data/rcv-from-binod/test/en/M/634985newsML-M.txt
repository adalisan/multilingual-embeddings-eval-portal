German shares ended bourse trade on Tuesday with modest gains , buoyed by the firmer dollar and higher German debt prices tied to prospects for an end to the fight between Bonn and the Bundesbank over gold reserves . 
the market got a late boost from statements from Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer and Finance Minister Theo Waigel after a meeting in Bonn that they were on the way to finding an end to their dispute over Bonn &apos;s plans to revalue the reserves . 
Waigel wants to use the booked profits from the reserves to pay down Germany &apos;s debt in a bid to help shore up Bonn &apos;s finances and qualify for European monetary union ( EMU ) . 
but traders said volumes were low , an indication of investor indecision about the future of the single currency and the risk it may be delayed from its January 1999 start date . 
construction group shares were at the forefront of activity on Tuesday after builder Hochtief AG and commercial bank Deutsche Bank AG said on Monday they were giving up plans to pool their stake in construction firm Philipp Holzmann AG . 
the plan was dropped after the European Commission would pass the case on to German cartel authorities . 
Holzmann shares tumbled 17 marks at 491 marks , while Hochtief shares fell 90 pfennigs at 73.80 marks . 
Deutsche shares lost 12 pfennigs to 96.38 marks .
