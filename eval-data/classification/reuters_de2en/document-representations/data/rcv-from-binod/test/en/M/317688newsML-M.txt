India &apos;s overheated stock markets are likely to cool this week with market players unwinding positions after a steep rise in interest costs , dealers and analysts said at the weekend . 
Carry-forward rates leapt to an annualised 40-45 percent on Saturday at the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ) against 15-17 percent a week ago . 
Antony Sequeira , managing director of Arcadia Share &amp; Stock brokers , said the higher charges -- for carrying forward transactions from one weekly settlement to another -- reflected huge overbought positions . 
but he said the markets were likely to remain volatile and unpredictable , with continued focus on speculative plays . 
&quot; It &apos;ll be in a trading range with bouts of optimism and pessimism driving prices with probably high volatility . 
the BSE &apos;s benchmark 30-share index closed last week with a minor gain of 4.03 points at 3,422.35 after a roller-coaster ride that saw the index hitting a five-month high of 3,812.31 during an early rally on Thursday . 
by the close on that day , the index had tumbled to end at a provisional 3,453.61 points . 
on Friday , the index eased a further 33.53 points . 
after rising more than 12 percent in seven straight days , the index had lost over 10 percent from its peak in two days in record trader-driven volumes , analysts said . 
Market-regulator the Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) said on Friday after a meeting with the heads of major bourses it was satisfied with measures taken by the stock markets chiefs to monitor trading . 
SEBI had convened the meeting to find ways to rein in excessive speculation and wide price swings . 
&quot; While there has been some institutional activity , it has been only in selective stocks . 
we continue to believe that the market is in a trading range , &quot; said Sanjeev Mohta , research head at James Capel B &amp; K. 
he recommended investors buy quality stocks that had underperformed in the recent rally . 
&quot; This is probably one of the best times to reshuffle one &apos;s portfolio , &quot; he said in a note . 
Mohta &apos;s top buys comprised Indian Hotels , and auto stocks Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Company and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra . 
other foreign funds also saw a silver lining in the longer term . 
Lehman Brothers said in a report it was overweighting the Indian stockmarket and set a target of 3,900 for the BSE index over 12 months . 
&quot; Given our forecast for a strong economic recovery and continued forecast declines in interest rates , we recommend moving away from stables ( stocks ) and selectively towards cyclicals , &quot; said its senior strategist Abhijit Chakrabortti .
