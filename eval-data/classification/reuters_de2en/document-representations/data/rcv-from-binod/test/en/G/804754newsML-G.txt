Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a personal envoy to thank Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for PLO aid in finding the killers of an Israeli taxi driver , Israeli government sources said on Sunday . 
they said the envoy , Yitzhak Molho , secretly met the Palestinian president in Gaza on Saturday night . 
the sources said the men also discussed last week &apos;s peace shuttle by veteran U.S. envoy Dennis Ross and sanctions Israel imposed on Palestinians after two suicide bombers killed 14 people in a Jerusalem market on July 30 . 
there was no immediate indication the meeting , the highest Israeli-PLO contact since Ross &apos; mission , would lead to an easing of the sanctions or to more vigorous Palestinian efforts on security wanted by Washington . 
Israel demanded Arafat arrest militants and crush the infrastructure of Islamist groups after the suicide attacks . 
it also sealed off Palestinian areas and froze millions of dollars of financial transfers it owes the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) . 
the Palestinian president rejected on Sunday Israeli allegations that his planned &quot; national unity &quot; talks with militant groups amounted to &quot; appeasement of terrorism &quot; . 
&quot; No doubt we are against terrorist activities ... but this is a Palestinian interest and we are insisting to carry on dialogue with all Palestinian groups , &quot; Arafat told reporters in Gaza . 
&quot; We are as Palestinians completely committed to the peace process and at the same time we are facing collective punishment from the Israeli government , &quot; Arafat said . 
Arafat said on Saturday he would not bow to Israeli &quot; dictates &quot; he clamp down on militants and called for the &quot; national unity &quot; talks this week with all Palestinian groups . 
the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas , which Israeli security sources say stood behind July &apos;s attack , took part in a first round of unity talks in February . 
Hamas boycotted a later round in April , saying its activists remained in Arafat &apos;s jails . 
the United States has said it will send Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to the Middle East to launch a major peace initiative when it sees &quot; sufficient &quot; PLO security cooperation with Israel . 
Washington has also repeatedly condemned Israel &apos;s sanctions as &quot; counterproductive &quot; and &quot; unhelpful &quot; . 
Arafat on Saturday cited the arrest by his forces of three Palestinian car thieves who confessed to murdering an Israeli taxi driver in Jericho as proof that the PA was working with Israeli police . 
Israeli police praised Palestinian forces for apprehending the driver &apos;s killers , who received long prison terms in a summary trial , but Israeli officials said cooperation in a criminal case could not replace a crackdown on &quot; terror &quot; . 
a Netanyahu aide on Saturday criticised Arafat &apos;s outreaching to militant groups . 
&quot; ( Arafat ) has been making agreements that flirt with the terrorist organisations since the Palestinian Authority was established . 
we don &apos;t believe that this kind of appeasement of terrorism works , &quot; aide David Bar-Illan said . 
the Palestinian Authority , pointing to trilateral Israeli-PLO-U.S. security meetings arranged by Ross last week , says it is making &quot; 100 percent effort &quot; on security but refuses to take orders from Israel . 
Netanyahu insists he will ease the sanctions hand-in-hand with Palestinian measures against militants . 
the Palestinian Authority announced it would parry Israel &apos;s sanctions with a gradual and selected boycott of Israeli goods . 
Arafat said Palestinians were prepared to weather the hardships of closure . 
&quot; We know how to face it as Palestinian people , &quot; he said .
