Spain &apos;s debt market ended higher but off peaks on Wednesday , as profit-taking before Thursday &apos;s holiday erased in part initial gains on lower-than-expected April consumer prices , dealers said . 
a widely expected 25-basis-point official rate cut as soon as Friday is already priced in , but the market is strong , and the longer end could reach new highs very soon , traders added . 
&quot; The Bank of Spain will cut on Friday and the market could correct a bit , &quot; said Jose Ramon Arechederra chief dealer at ABN AMRO in Madrid . 
&quot; But , if foreign markets are positive on Thursday , bonos will end up getting new gains on Friday . 
earlier on Wednesday National statistic Institute INE said April CPI rate was down to a yearly 1.7 percent versus 2.2 percent in March . 
such a fall strengthened expectations of a fresh monetary easing in the near term . 
a Reuter poll of 10 financial experts showed that all were expecting a key money market rate cut on Friday , with one saying that the reduction could be for half a point . 
&quot; A 25-basis-point cut would be better for the market than a bigger cut . 
if they move in small steps the market will know it is not the last easing , &quot; a dealer at BNP said . 
but dealers said also that a new wave of Euro-optimism was attracting investment in Spanish assets , and they said the spread over Bunds could be pushed lower very soon . 
the 10-year cash spread over Bunds fell to an all-time low early at 80 basis points , to end the day at 83 bps . 
&quot; It could fall toward the area of 60 / 70 basis points quickly , &quot; a dealer in Madrid said . 
but others said the 80 level was offering a very strong resistance . 
the long bond future had a resistance at 116.30 , chartists added .
