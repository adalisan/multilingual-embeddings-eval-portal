from Brcko to Mostar , Bosnia is simmering again and showing the world that a flawed and fragile peace may not last much beyond next year when the last NATO troops are supposed to leave . 
diplomats say the failure to resolve tensions at key flashpoints in Bosnia , the continued freedom of war criminals and other problems have undermined the Dayton agreement which ended the war in November 1995 . 
in the past week , the divided city of Mostar has seen the worst violence since the end of the conflict , while a decision on who should control the strategic town of Brcko has now been put off until next year . 
the European Union failed to unite Mostar in a two-year administration of the town , while the United States has failed to make the Moslem-Croat federation work properly as part of the peace deal it brokered . 
the issue of Brcko , which almost derailed the Dayton talks , is still so sensitive that an American arbiter announced on Friday the fate of the town would not be decided until next year . 
&quot; When you see what has happened in Mostar and how the issue of Brcko could have led to renewed conflict , you have to ask the question whether there is any chance for peace to last , &quot; said one Western diplomat , who asked not to be identified . 
the chief U.S. envoy on former Yugoslavia , Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum , made clear what could be at stake over the town of Brcko when he welcomed Friday &apos;s postponement decision . 
&quot; It &apos;s definitely enough to avoid war , &quot; he said . 
for the moment , peace is holding in Bosnia because thousands of troops in a NATO-led peace force are there with tanks to make sure that it does . 
but the force , already being cut in half from the 60,000 troops in Bosnia last year , is due to leave by the middle of 1998 . 
the United States has made clear it will certainly withdraw by that time , having committed troops for more than two years to prop up peace in the Balkans . 
European allies worry , too , about Bosnia turning into another Cyprus or Lebanon , with an indefinite deployment of troops to keep the warring sides apart . 
nevertheless , Western officials say there are already informal discussions about whether it is realistic to withdraw , given the circumstances . 
&quot; Bosnia caused us all so much anguish during the war and no one wants to see that come back , &quot; said one official . 
&quot; In the end , it may cost us less to stay on -- whatever is said publicly now . 
an added problem is that the Balkan region beyond Bosnia is facing unprecedented instability . 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic faces continued protests against his rule and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is reported to be terminally ill . Albania is in turmoil . 
the Dayton agreement aimed to set up a new Bosnian state , split between the Moslem-Croat federation and a Bosnian Serb entity . 
it provided for civil institutions , none of which are so far functioning properly and economic reconstruction , which has proceeded slowly . 
it said war criminals should be punished . 
most of them remain at large and NATO is unwilling to hunt them down and bring them to justice before an international court in The Hague . 
it provided for freedom of movement and the safe return of refugees , which remain paper promises for the Moslems in Mostar and for many others in Bosnia . 
diplomats say Croatia has supported Croat hardliners in Mostar , while there are fears Serbs and Moslems could start fighting again over Brcko when it is finally decided which side should have control . 
the major powers and international mediator Carl Bildt say the parties must implement the peace deal which came only after NATO used massive air power to batter the Bosnian Serbs into submission . 
the problem is that many in Bosnia do not want to live with people of different ethnic origin and see the Dayton agreement as an improvised peace , imposed on them by an exhausted international community -- not as the blueprint for a new and peaceful society .
