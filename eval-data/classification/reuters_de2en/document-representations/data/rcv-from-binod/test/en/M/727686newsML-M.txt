Southeast Asian palm oil prices are likely to be weak this week as rising production continued to run ahead of demand , regional traders said . 
palm markets are awaiting key Malaysian official crop data for June , due out around 0430 GMT on July 15 , to provide a clearer picture , regional traders said . 
Malaysia &apos;s Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority ( PORLA ) will release June output , stocks and export figures . 
&quot; Malaysia &apos;s production and export levels will be the key . 
a trader in Malaysia added the other key figure is the level of stocks , which is expected to be higher due to slow demand and high harvesting months . 
Singapore traders added official figures from PORLA are not expected to lend support to the market , with production and stocks in June seen rising strongly . 
Ivan Wong , a private crop forecaster , last week projected June &apos;s output at 785,000 tonnes and exports at 595,000 tonnes versus May &apos;s 626,606 tonnes . 
he put end-June stocks at 795,000 tonnes against 711,841 in May . 
&quot; We keep increasing production . 
demand is okay , but it &apos;s not enough , &quot; a dealer for a foreign trading house in Singapore said , adding exports need to hit more than 700,000 tonnes a month to nudge prices higher . 
everybody is feeling down at the moment , &quot; said another Singapore dealer . 
regional traders added soft soyoil prices in Chicago would also push the palm price lower , along with the fact that palm is still seen as relatively more expensive than soy . 
Malaysia &apos;s benchmark September futures contract , which closed on Friday at 1,128 ringgit , was seen testing the 1,100 ringgit a tonne floor this week . 
&quot; It &apos;ll definitely test 1,100 , &quot; said a senior trader . 
&quot; If the September futures contract breaks 1,120 , then 1,090 is the next target . 
a trader in Singapore added : &quot; The market is looking for a bottom . 
buying sentiment is weak . 
sustained thin buying interest coupled with increasing supply amid declining export prices could ease Indonesian palm olein prices , traders said . 
&quot; Export prices are almost on par with local prices , and this could see more oil entering the local market , &quot; an Indonesian trader said . 
&quot; There is talk that one company had already cancelled an export shipment and redirected the oil into the local market . 
the trader added : &quot; I think local prices could also weaken this week as buyers wait for prices to edge further down . 
Indonesian palm olein finished last week at 1,375-80 rupiah / kg in Jakarta , compared with 1,350 a week ago .
