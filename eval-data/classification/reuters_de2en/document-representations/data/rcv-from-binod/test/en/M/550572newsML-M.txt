stocks rose for the third straight day Wednesday after a report of surprisingly strong economic growth in a broad rally that carried the Dow above 7,000 for the first time in seven weeks . 
the Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.96 points to close at 7,008.99 , a day after soaring 179 points in its second largest point gain ever . 
the index is within reach of its March 11 record close of 7,085.16 . 
in the broader market , advancing issues outnumbered declines 1,599 to 942 on heavy volume of 556 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the market extended a rebound that has seen the Dow recapture more than 600 of the 700 points it lost between March 11 and April 11 . 
that sell-off was fuelled by worries about the impact on the economy and corporate profits of an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve . 
the central bank raised a key short-term rate a quarter point on March 25 , and hinted it would again raise rates to slow the economy and head off inflationary pressures . 
the market &apos;s rise on Wednesday came despite a report of much-stronger-than expected first quarter economic growth . 
the Commerce Department reported the nation &apos;s gross domestic product expanded at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the quarter , its fastest pace in more than nine years . 
the GDP number was much stronger than Wall Street economists &apos; forecasts for a 4.1 percent rate of growth . 
if new economic data affirms the belief that growth is moderating and inflation is under control , the market may well set new highs as investors skake off worries of further rate increases by the Fed . 
but some analysts were reluctant to declare the market &apos;s correction at an end , at least until stocks find their way back into record ground . 
even so , the pace of the rebound was surprising . 
&quot; This market truly has been manic-depressive in the last six weeks , &quot; said Scott Bleier , chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd . &quot; We corrected in four weeks and rallied almost all the way back in about two . 
if rates are in fact headed higher , the recent bounce may be close to its conclusion , some analysts said . 
&quot; It &apos;s certainly difficult to expect the market to make much headway here with a rate increase still on the table , &quot; said Dick Stein , vice president at U.S. Clearing Corp. 
another economic statistic will keep stock traders on the edge of their seats on Thursday . 
the highlight will be the National Association of Purchasing Management &apos;s manufacturing index for April , which is expected to fall to 53.6 from 55.0 in March , according to a Reuters poll . 
the April jobs report due on Friday is among those the Fed watches closely in gauging inflation pressures . 
as a result , few on Wall Street are modifying their interest rate outlooks yet . 
&quot; We remain convinced the Fed will tighten some more , &quot; said Phil Orlando , chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management . 
&quot; Nothing we &apos;ve seen changes that opinion . 
the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury rose 10 / 32 , sending its yield down to 6.96 percent from Tuesday &apos;s 6.98 percent . 
the bond &apos;s price and yield move in opposite directions . 
retailers and other cyclical issues turned in a solid performance , boosted by the robust economic picture . 
Woolworth Corp. gained 1-3 / 8 to 21-1 / 2 and Dayton Hudson Corp. rose 2-1 / 2 to 45 . 
technology stocks were also strong , led by a resurgent networking group . 
ascend Communications Corp. surged 4-5 / 16 to 45-3 / 4 , Bay Networks Inc. gained 1-1 / 2 to 17-7 / 8 and Cisco Systems Inc. rose 1-3 / 4 to 51-3 / 4 . 
Sinter metals Inc. soared 9-35 / 64 to 36-35 / 64 after Britain &apos;s GKN plc offered to buy the auto parts maker for $ 37 a share , or $ 570 million . 
the Nasdaq composite index rose 18.13 points to 1,260.76 . 
the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s composite index of 500 stocks rose 7.29 points to 801.34 . 
the American Stock Exchange index rose 4.88 to 552.91 . 
the NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks rose 3.32 to 416.94 . 
the average share was up 33 cents . 
the Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE , American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,519.287 up 69.824 or 0.94 percent .
