on Monday , the trader bought a late January 20,000-tonne cargo at $ 124.00 per tonne free-on-board Singapore . 
the purchase held prices up in the wake of lacklustre demand and the same trader is expected to continue buying for the rest of this week . 
&quot; The market is supported by some Chinese buying enquiries and the absence of new Middle East exports , &quot; one trader said .

January gas oil was last quoted at $ 32.00 / $ 32.10 a barrel , down from Monday &apos;s $ 32.15 / $ 32.25 , one broker said .
