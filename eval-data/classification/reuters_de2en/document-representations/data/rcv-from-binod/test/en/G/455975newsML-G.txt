Chilean lawmakers on on Thursday demanded an end to &quot; cultural authoritarianism &quot; after a television station was threatened with sanctions for jokes about the Bible and the national flag . 
&quot; What is clear is that in our country cultural authoritarianism still lingers on , &quot; socialist Sen. Ricardo Nunez told reporters . 
&quot; Part of the discussion is how to eliminate authoritarianism in Chile not only in the political sense and in values , but fundamentally in culture . 
the sanctions against the Rock and Pop television channel revived a debate over censorship that started last month when the Supreme Court upheld a ban on Martin Scorsese &apos;s film , &quot; The Last temptation of Christ . 
Chile has some of the strictest censorship laws in Latin America , a legacy of Gen. Augusto Pinochet &apos;s military regime , which ruled with an iron grip from 1973 to 1990 . 
the Rock and Pop channel was taken to task for a comedy programme that parodied the Bible , made jokes about the national anthem and portrayed Barbie dolls as transvestites . 
&quot; Every democratic society must guarantee ( an outlet for ) people &apos;s sense of humour and allow a certain space for irreverence , &quot; said socialist Sen. Carlos Ominami . 
&quot; Any country which loses this , risks returning to authoritarianism . 
the government has sent a law to Congress to end film and television censorship , creating in its place a classification system .
