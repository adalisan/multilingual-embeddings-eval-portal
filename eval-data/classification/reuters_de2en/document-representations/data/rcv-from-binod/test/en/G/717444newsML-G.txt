Algeria &apos;s banned Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) said on Wednesday their provisional leader Abdelkader Hachani had been freed from an Algiers prison just hours after being sentenced to five years in jail . 
it praised the move but called for further action by Algeria , including the lifting of a state of emergency in place since 1992 , the release of other jailed FIS leaders and allowing press and political freedom . 
&quot; The Islamic Salvation Front rejoices that our brother Abdelkader Hachani , unjustly imprisoned since January 23 , 1992 , has been freed , &quot; the FIS leadership in exile said in a statement received by a Western news agency in the French capital . 
but its top leaders Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj remain detained , serving 12-year terms for undermining the state . 
the Algerian newspaper Liberte said Hachani left the prison on Tuesday , where he was met by his two sons and brother Kamel . 
an Algiers court late on Monday sentenced Hachani to five years in prison , effectively setting free the leader of the once-powerful FIS as he had already spent more than five years in the high security Serkadji jail pending trial . 
the influential El Watan newspaper said the light sentence was a first signal that President Liamine Zeroual &apos;s government was moving to forge a broad consensus with the opposition . 
&quot; If this is confirmed , the authorities will lift the state of emergency accompanied by measures towards detainees awaiting trial , &quot; El Watan said . 
Algeria &apos;s main opposition leaders have urged the authorities to seek dialogue with the FIS to try to end bloodshed which has scarred the country for more than five years . 
they also want the state of emergency scrapped and militants freed to help build understanding and detente . 
Western diplomatic sources in Algiers and a European analyst said on Wednesday they did not see the release as a move to ease up on the FIS or use Hachani as any intermediary . 
&quot; The sentence spells a sign of confidence on the part of the authorities . 
it is a gesture to Islamists and the outside world but the FIS is banned and will remain so , &quot; said one diplomat . 
a European analyst who follows Algeria &apos;s crisis said the release was &quot; probably a gesture to outside and seen by the authorities as the best course to take for domestic consumption &quot; . 
Algeria imposed a state of emergency in February 1992 , giving the authorities huge powers to arrest people and search homes in a bid to check the then nascent guerrilla movement . 
the action was taken as violence erupted following the scrapping of a general election dominated by the FIS . 
Hachani had been held in prison nearly six months longer than the sentence passed by the Algiers criminal court on charges of seeking to undermine state security . 
under his provisional leadership , with the party &apos;s top leaders already detained by the military , the FIS won 188 of the 232 seats decided in the first round in December 1991 . 
the army-backed authorities then scrapped the poll in January 1992 and arrested Hachani about a week later . 
the charges against him arose from a statement in his name which appeared in al Khabar newspaper , urging Algerian soldiers to disobey officers and not to strike at Islamist activists . 
the Defence Ministry then charged that he had launched an &quot; appeal for rebellion in the army &quot; . 
Hachani , now aged about 40 , told the trial judges : &quot; The aim of the appeal was to avoid confrontation and involvement of the Popular National Army ( ANP ) in political struggles . 
about 60,000 people have been killed since the violence erupted . 
the country last month held another general election in which moderate Islamists were allowed to take part . 
the two Islamist parties won 103 seats in the 380-member National Assembly ( lower house ) . 
MP Ali Abdessalam Rachedi of the secular Socialist Forces Front told the house on Tuesday in a statement carried live on Algerian television that 1,000 people had been killed since the June 5 election .
