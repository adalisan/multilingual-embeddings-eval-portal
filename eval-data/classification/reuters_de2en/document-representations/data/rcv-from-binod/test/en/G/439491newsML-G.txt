residents of this northern Jordan town offered blood and sympathy for Israeli schoolgirls who were shot by a Jordanian soldier on Thursday but blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the attack . 
&quot; The attack should not have been against young innocent children but against Netanyahu who is stubborn and a tyrant , &quot; said Mifleh Awad , an elderly farmer sitting with other locals in a coffee shop in the centre of Shuna , 75 km ( 45 miles ) north of Amman . 
seven Israeli schoolgirls were killed and six wounded when the soldier opened fire on them on a field trip to a Jordan border site nicknamed &quot; The Island of Peace . 
hospital workers and doctors said over 20 people rushed to donate blood to the victims after Jordanian military cars took them to the local hospital here a few km ( miles ) from where the shooting took place . 
but residents said their sympathy for the victims did not diminish their fury with Netanyahu , whose plans to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem has sparked widespread anger in the Arab world . 
&quot; Netanyahu &apos;s behaviour has pushed this soldier to commit this act ... this was bound to happen . 
Israel has been encouraging this with the building of settlements , &quot; said one youth who refused to give his name . 
&quot; The soldier is an ordinary citizen who has felt let down and was not ready to keep his emotions seeing his people ( Palestinians ) there across the river being destroyed , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What can Netanyahu expect if Palestinian Arab land is usurped ... 
when your land is taken over , you are entitled to resist by all means , &quot; said another . 
Sheikh Yousef Ahmed , a local elder , said Israel wanted domination not genuine peace with its neighbours . 
&quot; All the Jordanian people extended their hands for peace but the Israelis have not extended their hands fully for an honourable , just and comprehensive peace , &quot; he said , echoing widespread disappointment by ordinary Jordanians with the few gains so far from the 1994 peace treaty with Israel . 
the Jordanian soldier was said to be a 26-year-old army driver who started his posting at the border area earlier this year . 
one of his army comrades identified him as Ahmed Moussa , from the town of Adasiya , a few km ( miles ) from the site of the shooting , on the joint border defined under a 1994 peace treaty between the two countries . 
an electronic security fence runs along parts of the frontier but violent incidents are rare .
