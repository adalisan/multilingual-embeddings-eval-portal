emerging market debt prices hovered around overnight levels on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve &apos;s key policy meeting , Brady bond traders said . 
&quot; Everyone has shut up shop and is sitting on their hands , &quot; an emerging market analyst said . 
&quot; If the Fed hikes rates it won &apos;t be a surprise and emerging market debt spreads will widen in the short-term . 
&quot; If they don &apos;t hike rates , we should see a relief rally in Treasury markets and Brady bonds with spreads tightening but then all eyes will be on the next FOMC meeting in July which will cap the upside , &quot; he said . 
opinions were split over whether the Fed would raise U.S. rates or not . 
in a Reuters survey , a slight majority of U.S. primary dealers believed the Fed would keep key rates unchanged . 
of the most liquid Brady instruments , the Argentine FRBs were unchanged at 92-1 / 4 bid , while Brazil &quot; C &quot; bonds were down 1 / 4 at 75-7 / 8 bid . 
Venezuelan DCBs were holding steady at 89-3 / 4 bid , and FLIRBs unchanged at 90-1 / 8 , while Mexican discounts were slightly off by 1 / 8 at 91-1 / 8 bid .
