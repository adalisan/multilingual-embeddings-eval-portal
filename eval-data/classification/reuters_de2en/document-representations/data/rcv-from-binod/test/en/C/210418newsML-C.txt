Quaker oats Co said its Snapple beverage Corp unit has transferred distribution rights in Dallas / Fort worth , Houston and Waco , Texas , to Dr PEPPER bottling Co of Texas . 
as a result , Southwest Snapple , a company-owned distributor , will be closed , effective December 27 . 
&quot; With its size , population and climate , Texas is one of the best beverage markets in the country , &quot; Michael Schott , president-Snapple beverages , said in a statement . 
&quot; However , Snapple has underdeveloped potential in Texas , relative to our success on both coasts . 
Dr PEPPER bottling is one of the three largest privately owned bottlers in the United States . 
it has bottling plants in Dallas and Houston and nine distribution centers in Texas . 
annual sales are about $ 500 million . 
currently , Snapple is distributed in Texas through a two-tier system . 
grocery and convenience store channels are serviced through brokers , and Southwest Snapple serviced the &quot; up and down the street accounts &quot; that include smaller , independent outlets . 
under the new arrangement , Dr PEPPER bottling and 10 independent distributors throughout the state will handle all distribution channels . 
Schott said severance benefits and outplace assistance will be offered to affected employees of Southwest Snapple , which employs about 100 people .
