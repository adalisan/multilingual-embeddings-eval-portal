future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa flew to Beijing on Wednesday for talks on foreigners &apos; access to the territory and a threatened influx of mainland immigrants after it reverts to Chinese rule on July 1 . 
Tung will also join a meeting of the China-controlled Preparatory Committee to hammer out the rules for future Hong Kong elections , a sensitive issue as many in Hong Kong fret about the future of their fledgling democratic electoral system . 
Tung , a former shipping magnate appointed by China to run Hong Kong after the British hand back the colony in six weeks &apos; time , will meet Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Beijing &apos;s chief Hong Kong policy-maker Lu Ping , a spokesman for Tung said . 
&quot; They &apos;ll be talking about passports and access to Hong Kong , &quot; spokesman Bob Howlett told Reuters . 
&quot; They &apos;ll discuss how to cope with the influx of children of people living here and anyone else who wants to come , &quot; he said . 
Tung has taken key figures in his government-in-waiting with him , and they could discuss a wide range of problems facing his team in the remaining 41 days of British rule , he said . 
his senior aide Michael Suen , Immigration Director Regina IP and Justice Secretary Elsie Leung will be in the entourage . 
the talks come against a backdrop of a highly charged political atmosphere in Hong Kong , with pro-democracy figures predicting repression after July 1 , while in the business sector , by contrast , confidence is running high . 
a Hong Kong unionist legislator , Chan Yuen-han , has tabled a bill to tighten up visas for foreigners and restrict their right to work , a proposal opposed by business bosses including Chamber of Commerce chairman James Tien . 
Tien has been lobbying Beijing this week to oppose the bill . 
&quot; Easy access is vital to Hong Kong &apos;s continued commercial success , for example in trade and tourism , &quot; said Howlett , indicating Tung would not favour tightening access . 
until now Britons have been free to work in Hong Kong without permits , and other Western nationals have found it fairly easy to get permission to work or run businesses . 
Britons &apos; privileges will disappear and all foreigners will be on the same footing after July 1 . 
but Chan wants to impose tighter visa rules to protect jobs . 
China said last weekend however that easy access to Hong Kong was likely to continue . 
the expatriate community in Hong Kong counts about 450,000 people . 
the biggest groups are the 140,000 Filipinos , 37,000 Americans , 32,000 Britons and 30,000 Canadians . 
Tung will also tackle Beijing over a threat of an invasion of immigrants from China , a land of 1.2 billion people . 
these prospective settlers have their eye on a better life in Hong Kong , a city of just 6.4 million , which many Chinese imagine is paved with gold . 
in the first four months of 1997 , 7,406 illegal migrants , including many infants , were arrested around border areas , against 23,180 for the whole of 1996 . 
the upsurge reflects a widely held belief in China , officially denied , that there might be an amnesty for illegals in Hong Kong after July 1 . 
at the Preparatory Committee meeting on Thursday , Chinese officials and Hong Kong representatives will work on proposed electoral rules for the first post-handover elections in 1998 . 
Tung has been reported at odds with the committee &apos;s drafters on the issue by preferring they leave most of the rule setting to his government . 
the drafters have proposed precise rules on constituencies and voting which would make it hard for pro-democracy groups to win seats .
