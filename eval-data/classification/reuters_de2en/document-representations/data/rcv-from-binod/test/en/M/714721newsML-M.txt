Australian bonds broke out of their morning slumber with 10-year bond futures edging to a new 3-1 / 2 year high of 93.220 at the start of the afternoon session following comments by Prime Minister John Howard . 
Howard told a Liberal Party gathering in the Queensland state that &quot; One of the reasons why interest rates have come down in Australia , and I &apos;d like to see them still lower ... is that we are no longer running such large deficits . 
the local market &apos;s recent strong rally has stalled in the past few days amid caution in front Thursday &apos;s labour force data , which may give a clue to future monetary policy . 
early interest had been extremely light , but the market had been firmly underpinned by further strength in U.S. treasuries in New York on Monday . 
while it was unclear whether Howard was referring to official 5.5 percent interest rates in his comments , it was sufficient to knock down the Australian dollar to a new 18-month low of US $ 0.7417 . 
the dollar has been suffering for some weeks on monetary policy uncertainty and more recently from a slump in the gold price and other weakening commodity prices .
