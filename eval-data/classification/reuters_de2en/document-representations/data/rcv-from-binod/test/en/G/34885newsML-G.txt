Shanghai officials are at pains to emphasise that the city will not threaten the position of Hong Kong after Britain hands it back to China next year , the Lord Mayor of London Sir John Chalstrey said on Thursday . 
Chalstrey , who arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday for a three-day visit , met Shanghai &apos;s mayor Xu Kuangdi on Wednesday and signed a protocol between the two cities calling for greater cooperation , particularly on training of staff . 
&quot; The vice-mayor Zhao Qichen went out of his way to emphasise that Shanghai will not be stepping on Hong Kong &apos;s toes , &quot; Chalstrey said . 
&quot; He said Hong Kong will be the international financial centre and Shanghai the domestic financial centre . 
he said he believed there was much that London could do to help Shanghai in its effort to regain its position as a major financial centre and said there would be growing exchanges between the two cities in the future .
