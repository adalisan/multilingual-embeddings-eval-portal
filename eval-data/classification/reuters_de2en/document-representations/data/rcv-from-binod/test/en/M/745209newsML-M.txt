world oil prices edged gently upwards on Tuesday , underpinned by a growing realisation that Iraqi crude will not be exported for several weeks more . 
traders had expected Iraq to resume its long-delayed oil sales at the start of August , pushing out hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude and bringing world prices crashing lower . 
that time-frame appears to have slipped , although neither Iraq nor the United Nations , which supervises the sales under the oil-for-food deal , has formally said so . 
&quot; The middle of August is the earliest that people now actually expect barrels on their doorsteps , &quot; said Leslie Nicholas , oil analyst at brokers GNI . 
on Tuesday Iraqi ambassador to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoon insisted there were no problems in implementing the aid distribution plan Baghdad says must be finalised before it will restart exports due to have commenced on June 9 . 
everybody needs money , so I don &apos;t foresee any problems , &quot; said Hamdoon . 
but he added the review of the aid plan , formally submitted on Monday , will last at least through this weekend . 
Western diplomats had predicted it taking a week for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to agree the deal . 
the sales , designed to relieve the sufferings of civilians under sanctions , should net Baghdad $ 2 billion every six months for food and medicine , but Iraq complains aid disbursement has been slow . 
once the hand-out plan is settled , price formulae for the oil must be submitted to the United Nations and contracts agreed with buyers , a process that could take at least another two weeks . 
Iraqi worries and supply disruptions in the North Sea have provided a cushion for oil prices , stopping benchmark Brent blend from sinking below $ 18 a barrel . 
the price has fallen by 25 percent this year . 
September futures contracts for world benchmark Brent blend crude closed up 13 cents at $ 18.22 a barrel . 
traders are divided on how badly prices will be hit when Iraqi sales do resume , with some suggesting the bad news has already been factored in , and others saying the potentially huge volume will severely depress values . 
Iraq has to sell $ 1 billion of oil in two 90 day periods , and has been told it can carry over only five percent &apos;s worth , forcing it to at least double previous export volumes in August to hit its cash target . 
in the short-term oil prices have been helped by the recent strength of gasoline in the United States , where a key blending component in reformulated gasoline , methyl tertiary butyl ether , has shot up in price . 
dealers said there may also be some anticipation in the market of a bullish draw in crude and gasoline stocks in this week &apos;s U.S. industry stock data , due out tonight , after production disruption caused by Hurricane Danny .
