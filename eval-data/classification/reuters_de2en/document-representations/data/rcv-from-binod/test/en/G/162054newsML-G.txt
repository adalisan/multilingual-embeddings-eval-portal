Boland and Griqualand West shared 
the spoils after the second day of their four-day Supersport 
series cricket match at Boland Bank Park on Saturday . 
bowled out for 268 in their first innings , Boland restricted 
their visitors to 249 for nine at stumps . 
after struggling to remove the Griquas openers , the Boland 
attack , often guilty of bowling both sides of the wicket , 
rallied by picking up wickets at crucial stages . 
Griquas openers Mickey Arthur ( 31 ) and Martyn Gidley ( 39 ) 
made a solid start before Arthur was given out leg before wicket 
by umpire Cyril Mitchley . 
thereafter , Griquas rarely looked comfortable as slow 
left-armer Claude Henderson and seamer Roger Telemachus 
maintained a tidy line which strangled the Griqua reply . 
Henderson proved to be the pick of the Boland attack , 
collecting 3-69 off 34 overs , but the supporting roles of 
Telemachus and , to a lesser degree , Henry Williams and David 
Millns also kept Griquas in check . 
the Griqua reply was built around a workmanlike 64 from 
Pieter Barnard who hit seven fours in his stay of one and a half 
hours at the crease while Finley Brooker ( 34 ) and Cedric English 
( 27 ) also chipped in with valuable contributions .
