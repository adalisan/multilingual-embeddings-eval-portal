Indian global depositary receipts were marked down in very quiet dealings on Thursday as the market wound down ahead of Independence Day and a long weekend in India . 
&quot; It &apos;s been very quiet and with Independence Day we are unlikely to see much activity in the GDRs on Friday , &quot; said one broker . 
but blue chip reliance once again defied the softer trend , adding 12 cents to $ 23.50 / 24.50 on continued good support . 
the Cazenove Indian GDR index , which measures changes from midday to midday , was down 1.58 points at 95.30 as Bombay stocks shed 49.16 to 4,320.97 . 
Taiwan , however , shrugged off recent losses as electronic shares bounced back and the Capel Taiwan index added 0.73 points , or 0.54 percent , at 135.37 -- representing a discount of 3.44 percent . 
the Capel Korea index finished down 0.52 points , or 0.67 percent , at 76.39 , a premium of 37.57 percent .
