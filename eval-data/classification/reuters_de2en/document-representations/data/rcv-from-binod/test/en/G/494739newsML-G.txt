the former leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois , Michel Gauthier , said on Tuesday he would run again for the federal Parliament and that he was sure of a new Quebec independence referendum in the next term . 
&quot; I &apos;m sure we will have a referendum in the next mandate ( of the federal House of Commons ) , and I will be there for that , &quot; Gauthier , replaced by former communist Gilles Duceppe as leader of the Bloc last month , told a news conference . 
&quot; My target is to work for the sovereignty of Quebec and it &apos;s the main reason why I decided to be candidate once more . 
Gauthier replaced separatist firebrand Lucien Bouchard -- now Quebec premier -- as leader of the Bloc last year , but was criticized for being less charismatic . 
he said private citizens as well as Bloc members encouraged him to run again . 
Quebec separatists narrowly lost a referendum on Quebec sovereignty in October 1995 . 
the Quebec government cannot hold another referendum until it holds provincial elections , widely expected in 1998 .
