Indonesian activists said on Wednesday they would raise their own human rights agenda at an alternative conference in the Philippines later this month to coincide with the official APEC forum . 
along with human rights activists from the other Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) members , they planned to highlight problems related to free trade , Hafild said . 
these included violation of human rights , environmental pollution , workers &apos; living standards and the plight of migrant labour , INFID , an umbrella group of Indonesian non-governmental organisations , said in a statement . 
APEC heads of states hold their summit in the Philippines on November 25 . 
Manila on Tuesday arrested one of the country &apos;s top leftist leaders who was to head an anti-APEC workers &apos; meeting to coincide with the summit . 
although authorities denied the arrest had any link with summit preparations , security is expected to be very tight ahead of the meeting . 
Hafild denied that Indonesian NGOs were going to the Philippines to demonstrate against APEC . 
&quot; We are not going for demonstration but to put our aspirations forward and to meet with other civil societies , &quot; she said , adding , however , that the issue of Indonesia &apos;s disputed territory of East Timor would probably be on their agenda . 
the Philippines banned East Timor resistance leader and Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta from attending an international NGO meeting to be held in parallel with the APEC summit in a move of solidarity with the Indonesian government . 
Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year , a move never recognised by the United Nations . 
APEC groups Australia , Brunei , Canada , Chile , China , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Japan , Malaysia , Mexico , New Zealand , Papua New Guinea , the Philippines , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , Thailand and the United States .
