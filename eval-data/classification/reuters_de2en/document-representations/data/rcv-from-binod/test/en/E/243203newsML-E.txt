Yugoslav economists on Monday urged tighter control of public spending together with a shake-up of public finances to free funds for investment . 
the government has forecast 1997 public spending at 47.5 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) which is planned to rise 13 percent to 103.28 billion dinars ( $ 20.9 billion ) . 
&quot; Public spending is planned with insufficient rigour and the government manages to collect a little over 60 percent of its projected revenues , &quot; said Aleksandra Posarac of the Institute of Economic Sciences ( IEN ) . 
according to the latest IEN monthly report , the government collected only 71.6 percent of its planned monthly revenue of 3.33 billion dinars in October . 
Yugoslavia generates income from sales and income tax and customs duties . 
Posarac insisted serious reorganisation of public spending was needed to provide more money for investment . 
independent economist Branko Ljutic told Reuters that Yugoslavia &apos;s per capita income was $ 700- $ 900 , compared with the official estimate of $ 1,500 , and said public spending had not fallen in line with the contraction of the economy . 
&quot; Public spending could be reduced only if army , police and state administration were cut to acceptable levels . 
the state must become smaller and more efficient with transparent public administration , &quot; Ljutic said . 
&quot; According to our figures , public spending takes 50-55 percent of GDP and the percentage would be even higher if para-fiscal deficit was included , &quot; Posarac said . 
economists said neither company losses nor overdue payments or social insurance to public sector workers were calculated as a part of the fiscal deficit . 
the IEN report said the government owed 1.5 billion dinars ( $ 300 million ) in unpaid social insurance . 
this amount excluded delayed pensions , salaries to public sector workers , 5-6 months of child and maternity benefits . 
&quot; The government never includes public debt in its calculations of budget deficit . 
moreover , it says there is no budget deficit . 
but once Yugoslavia strikes a deal with the International Monetary Fund , it will have to present a consolidated balance of its public finances , &quot; Posarac said .
