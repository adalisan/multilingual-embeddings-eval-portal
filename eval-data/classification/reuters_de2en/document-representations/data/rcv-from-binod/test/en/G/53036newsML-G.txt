China &apos;s population hit 1.2112 billion at the end of 1995 and could jump to 1.3 billion at the end of the century if families defy a strict one-couple , one-child family planning policy , officials said on Friday . 
the number of Chinese could top 1.3 billion if the total fertility rate , or the average number of children borne by each woman in her lifetime , reached 2.5 in the five years from 1996 to 2000 , an official of the population statistics department said by telephone . 
the current total fertility rate was about 2.0 and if it remained at that level , China &apos;s population would hit 1.279 billion in 2000 , the official said . 
China limits couples to one child , and while this policy is strictly enforced in cities it is flouted with greater frequency in rural areas where increasingly well-off farmers brave the invevitable fines to boost their families . 
China had hoped to keep its population below 1.2 billion until 2000 but abandoned that target after people exceeded that number in February 1995 . 
it then set the new end-of-century target at 1.3 billion . 
China had 1.2112 billion people at the end of 1995 , the official said . 
Beijing launched its tough family planning policy in 1979 when its population neared one billion after 20 years of promotion of big families by Chairman Mao Zedong , who believed a large population would make China strong . 
China has come under fire from human rights groups and foreign governments who accuse it of using forced abortions and sterilisations to check its population . 
China answers such charges by saying it must feed 22 percent of the world &apos;s population on just seven percent of its arable land .
