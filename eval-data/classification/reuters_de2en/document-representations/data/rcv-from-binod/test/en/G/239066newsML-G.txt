England coach David Lloyd made it clear on Friday he has &quot; absolute confidence &quot; in the team humbed by seven wickets with a day to spare by Mashonoland . 
&quot; After the match we just reiterated to the players that we are on a mission , &quot; said Lloyd as he reflected on Thursday &apos;s embarrassing defeat . 
&quot; We may have had a couple of reverses , we would have liked to have won , played better and competed better but I have absolute confidence in the players . 
Lloyd blamed his team &apos;s second successive defeat on their Zimbabwean tour on &quot; tentativeness &quot; . 
&quot; We didn &apos;t impose ourselves on them at all . 
Gary Brent ( who took four wickets in England &apos;s second innings ) is slow medium -- he bowls like Wayne Morton ( the England physio ) -- but we looked sluggish against him . 
the seam bowling has been under par , too . 
&quot; We &apos;re angry , frustrated and disappointed that it didn &apos;t happen as we wanted it to but we know that we are much better than that . 
the fitness of skipper Mike Atherton is another concern for Lloyd . 
he had X-rays on his troublesome back on Thursday . 
&quot; His back is a problem but it &apos;s not something new and we will deal with it , &quot; said Lloyd . 
&quot; He is in the best possible spirits . 
England have a one-day match against Matabeleland on Sunday and a four- day game against the same opposition starting on Tuesday before the first one- day international against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on December 15 .
