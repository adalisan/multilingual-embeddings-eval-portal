Israeli shares closed broadly higher on Sunday as yields on inflation-linked bonds extended their fall , traders said . 
the benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 1.08 percent , or 3.23 points , to 301.97 on a moderate all-share turnover of 175 million shekels against 185 million shekels on Thursday , the last day of trading before the Israeli weekend . 
the Maof 25 blue chip index closed 1.49 percent higher at 308.15 . 
&quot; The main reason for the strong rise of the market is the recent rise in the prices for CPI-linked long bonds , &quot; said Danniella Finn , head of sales at Batucha Securities and Investments . 
&quot; yields on these bonds fell to less than four percent and they are expected to continue falling . 
&quot; falling bond yields will send more money into the stock market . 
moreover , the government is expected to issue fewer bonds in the near term and many saving plans expire this month . 
some of this money will eventually find its way to the market , &quot; Finn said . 
in its weekly report , First International Bank of Israel recommended that clients selectively increase their portfolios &apos; equities weighting . 
it said share prices would continue rising as mutual funds attracted new money and bond yields continued falling . 
&quot; Investors are very optimistic and the market looks good . 
after the index lost almost two percent on Thursday the market is ready to rise again , &quot; said Elisha Rosenfeld at Lehava Investments . 
&quot; Even an attempt by Maof options speculators to push the market downwards today failed , &quot; Rosenfeld added . 
formula Systems gained 2.75 percent to 6,518 agorot . 
Carnegie Emerging Markets initiated coverage of Formula with a strong buy recommendation , saying the stock remained significantly undervalued despite a doubling in price in the past year . 
Carnegie said Formula &apos;s earnings per share would reach 7.34 shekels in 1997 and 7.72 shekels in 1998 from 3.08 shekels in 1996 . 
it set a six-month price target of 85 shekels for the shares .
