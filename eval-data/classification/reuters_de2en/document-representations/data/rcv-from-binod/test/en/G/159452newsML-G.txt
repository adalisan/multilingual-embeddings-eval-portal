Shahid Afridi and Saeed Anwar scored sparkling half-centuries as Pakistan destroyed Zimbabwe by nine wickets to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in their three-match limited overs series on Friday . 
Afridi , who holds the record for the fastest one-day century , blasted a typically aggressive 66 and Anwar made an unbeaten 84 as the home side romped home in 28.1 overs . 
Zimbabwe were earlier bundled out for 195 in 49.1 overs . 
sixteen-year-old Afridi set the Gaddafi Stadium alight with his electrifying innings , lashing eight fours and four sixes in just 36 balls . 
the two openers punished Zimbabwe &apos;s bowling attack reaching 100 in just 10.2 overs . 
Afridi , who was dropped by Guy Whittal when he was on 11 , reached 50 with his fourth six , a lofted drive off leg-spinner Paul Strang who conceded 17 runs in his second over . 
Afridi was eventually bowled by John Rennie attempting another big drive . 
but there was no further success for the tiring Zimbabwe bowlers as Anwar and Ijaz Ahmad steered the team to a comfortable win with an unbeaten second-wicket stand of 96 in 93 balls . 
Anwar cracked 11 fours and a six from 79 balls while Ijaz hit two fours in his unbeaten 34 from 59 balls . 
Zimbabwe chose to bat after winning the toss but never recovered from the early loss of Grant Flower , who fell in fast Bowler Shahid Nazir &apos;s third over . 
only Andy Flower offered any resistance with a top score of 51 , which included three fours in 67 balls . 
Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq was the most successful Bowler with three for 46 . 
Pakistan won the opening match of the series by three wickets . 
the last game will be in Peshawar on Sunday .
