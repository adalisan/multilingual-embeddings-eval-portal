a 14-year-old British boy was on Friday ordered detained indefinitely for the murder of a nine-year-old schoolgirl whom he battered to death on a railway line in a killing that shocked the nation . 
Brian Smith , who was 13 at the time of the murder , showed no emotion as he was led from the dock by a social worker after sentence was passed . 
judge John Kay told him : &quot; I think you are a very , very dangerous boy ... What you did that day was a dreadful , wicked thing . 
Smith changed his plea to guilty on Friday after denying murdering jade Matthews when he first appeared in court last November . 
he beat her to death with a window frame last July at Bootle in northwestern England because he was afraid she would tell her stepfather after Smith had pushed her over and cut her head , the prosecution said . 
detectives believe Matthews was hurt accidentally , and the boy panicked and killed her simply because he feared retribution from her protective stepfather . 
Smith had insisted to police that he had given the girl a lift on his bicycle but had left her safe and well in a park . 
but he confessed to having killed her during a series of interviews with a leading forensic adolescent psychiatrist . 
the moments when Matthews was murdered was caught on a security camera , though the quality was so bad that the pair were little more than dots moving on a screen . 
the case prompted comparisons with the murder three years earlier of two-year-old Jamie Bulger by two young boys . 
the toddler was caught on security cameras as he was being led away to his death , also by a railway line .
