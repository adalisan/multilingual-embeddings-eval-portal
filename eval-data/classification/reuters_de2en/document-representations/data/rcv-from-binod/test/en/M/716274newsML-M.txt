the dollar is likely to move in a narrow range versus the yen in Asia on Thursday , as the market &apos;s attention is expected to shift from dollar / yen to European currencies , particularly sterling . 
worries about Japan &apos;s growing trade surplus persist , but the market lacks fresh incentives to push the greenback lower in the near term , traders said . 
&quot; Dollar / yen is likely to move narrowly today . 
after downside probes failed yesterday , people are becoming wary of pushing the dollar sharply below 112.50 yen , &quot; said a trader at a trust bank . 
the Japan-U.S. Business Council meeting in San Francisco ended on Wednesday with U.S. and Japanese business leaders calling for steps to minimise a rise in the Japanese trade surplus and to stabilise the yen-dollar exchange rate within &quot; an appropriate range &quot; . 
&quot; The market seems to have ran out of incentives for dollar / yen for now with the end of the Business Council meeting , &quot; said the trust bank trader . 
if Japanese stocks and government bonds show big price swings , however , that could have some impact on dollar / yen , traders said . 
on Wednesday , the Nikkei 225 stock average &apos;s slide was partly responsible for discouraging yen buying , traders said . 
operators are waiting for Bank of England &apos;s decision on interest rates at its monetary policy meeting which ends later on Thursday . 
most market participants expect the BOE to raise interest rates by a quarter point . 
&quot; The market seems to have already factored in an interest rate hike of 25 basis points . 
if the BOE decides to raise rates by 50 basis points , sterling could rally , &quot; said a city bank trader . 
early in New York trade on Wednesday , the dollar rose to 1.7655 marks , its highest level since February 1994 , mostly as a result of continued mark selling by investors concerned that Europe will replace the German currency with a broad-based , but weak single currency in 1999 . 
the greenback , however , retreated below 1.7600 marks following a late slide in the Dow Jones industrial average , which closed down almost 120 points . 
the dollar ended at 112.71 / 81 yen and 1.7598 / 08 marks on Wednesday in New York .
