an Iranian newspaper on Thursday vowed that Salman Rushdie would be killed despite Tehran &apos;s assurances that it would not seek out the British author . 
&quot; Regardless of the wishes of Satan &apos;s supporters , Salman Rushdie is for ever sentenced to death and will have to be punished for insulting the Moslems &apos; sacred values , &quot; the hardline conservative Islamic daily Jomhuri Eslami said . 
&quot; Even if Islamic governments do not send commandos to kill Salman Rushdie ... ( he ) will be followed to the day of his death by Moslems , &quot; the newspaper said . 
it was referring to an Iranian foreign ministry statement on Tuesday that said a death edict against Rushdie was irrevocable , but added that Iran would not send commandos to kill him . 
Iran &apos;s late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989 issued the edict condemning Rushdie to death for alleged blasphemy against Islam in his novel &quot; The satanic verses &quot; . 
Jomhuri Eslami said the religious edict &quot; is a divine order which all Moslems , including government officials , are dutybound to carry out if they are able . 
&quot; The $ 2 million reward for the person who carries out the death sentence of Salman Rushdie is still valid , &quot; it added , referring to the sum offered by an Iranian foundation . 
some reports suggest that Iran , eager to solve the row with the European Union over Rushdie , was prepared to give the EU assurances that it would not send anyone to kill him or assist others in killing him . 
Iranian officials say the edict is a religious matter unrelated to state policies and no one can cancel it .
