new Zealand &apos;s real seasonally adjusted Gross Domestic Product grew 0.3 percent in the June quarter , marginally below economists &apos; forecasts of 0.4 percent , Statistics New Zealand data released on Friday showed . 
the growth rate was the smallest for 16 quarters , since September 1992 when it fell 0.7 percent . 
the actual annual growth in the June year was 2.6 percent against forecasts of 2.3 percent and against 3.1 percent growth in the March year . 
the expenditure-based measure showed no change in the June quarter . 
acting Government statistician Ian Ewing said the economy continued to slow following the relatively strong growth pattern during 1994 and early 1995 . 
the annual growth rate has fallen from a peak of 6.6 percent in the 1994 June year and 4.8 percent in the June 1995 year . 
during the June year , employment increased 3.7 percent but this was partially offset by a fall in average hours worked of 0.8 percent . 
Houshold and government spending showed small increases in the June quarter as did business investment . 
however , these rises were more than offset by a large rundown in stocks resulting in total internal demand falling by 0.4 percent . 
this is the first quarterly decrease in stocks for five years , Ewing said . 
there was recovery in exports of 3.0 percent following two quarterly falls , largely as a result of strong growth in dairy exports . 
manufactured exports were also up . 
imports rose 1.6 percent , down on the 4.1 percent rise last quarter but still up 6.8 percent for the June year . 
the rise in business investment in the June quarter was primarily the result of an increase in investment in plant , machinery and equipment which rose 5.0 percent after a 3.8 percent decrease in the previous quarter . 
for the June year , business investment remained at high levels , up 8.5 percent , although this was down on the very strong annual increases of 17.7 percent and 16.6 percent recorded in the previous two years . 
business activity , which excludes general government and owner-occupied housing , grew by only 0.3 percent this quarter . 
this was largely the result of continuing growth in service industries which are up 0.8 percent this quarter and 4.8 percent for the June year . 
growth in the communications industry over the past eight years continued , and was especially strong in telecommunications . 
this rise in activity however , was moderated by little or no growth in other industries . 
primary industry production was flat at 0.1 percent and other goods-producing industries were down 0.5 percent with manufacturing down 0.5 percent , electricity , gas and water down 0.7 percent and construction down 0.5 percent . 
the level of manufacturing activity fell 0.5 percent this quarter and flattened down to 0.7 percent for the June year .
