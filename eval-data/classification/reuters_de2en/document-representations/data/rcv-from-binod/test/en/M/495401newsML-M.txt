stock market investors must be aware of the risks , as well as the benefits , of putting their money into equities , U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Tuesday . 
&quot; It is very important to remember that stocks have not only benefits but risks , &quot; he told college students here . 
his comments were mainly directed at Vietnam , which is considering developing a stock market of its own . 
but they could easily apply to the United States as well , where a a whole new crop of investors have have begun to put money into stocks over the past few years and have never had the experience of a bear market and falling prices . 
many of those individual investors have been lured into the market by brokers &apos; arguments that stocks , over the long run , have performed better than safer investments such as bonds or money market funds . 
as is his wont , Rubin declined to comment directly on the recent swoon in stock prices in the United States . 
&quot; It is often very hard to know why they do what they do , &quot; he said in response to a question from one student .
