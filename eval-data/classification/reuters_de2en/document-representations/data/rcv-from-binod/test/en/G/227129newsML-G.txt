Moldovans voted on Sunday in the second round of the former Soviet republic &apos;s first multi-candidate presidential election after a bitter campaign pitting President Mircea Snegur against the head of parliament . 
speaker Petru Lucinschi , a leftist running neck-and-neck with Snegur in opinion polls , accused the president of plotting to rig the ballot or send his followers on to the streets if he lost . 
Snegur retorted that his rival had run a dirty campaign . 
&quot; There are people saying they will not surrender , &quot; Lucinschi said as he cast his ballot in the capital , Chisinau . 
after polls closed at 8 p.m. ( 1800 GMT ) , the city was calm , although about 100 pro-Snegur teenage students gathered in front of the electoral commission headquarters in the city centre . 
several told Reuters they would protest if Snegur lost . 
&quot; If he loses , there &apos;ll be trouble , &quot; said one youth . 
but armed police nearby said they expected no problems . 
the first results are expected during the night . 
the head of the electoral commission said there had been no significant violations of voting rules that would affect the result . 
foreign observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe also had no reports of major trouble . 
turnout an hour before polls closed was 68.5 percent , up on the 67 percent first-round total on November 17 . 
there were high turnouts in Chisinau and the second city , Balti , where the one-third Russian-speaking minority is concentrated -- a fact that may favour Lucinschi over Snegur , whose biggest support is in the Romanian-speaking countryside . 
OSCE coordinator Kare Vollan told Reuters his observers had paid particular attention to polling stations close to the Russian-speaking Dnestr region , which broke away in 1990 fearing Moldovans wanted to unite with ethnic kin in Romania . 
authorities in the area , where hundreds died in fighting in 1992 , boycotted the poll but said local people could vote elsewhere . 
only a few thousand did so in the first round . 
pledging to press on with incomplete western-style market reforms , the 56-year-old Snegur polled 39 percent in the first round and has since been endorsed by pro-Romanian nationalists . 
but he faced stiff opposition . 
Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli , knocked out in the first round , supported Lucinschi , who was also backed by communists , state television , much of the press and the Orthodox Church . 
Sangheli has said he will resign after the election &quot; to preserve civil peace &quot; . 
the president &apos;s bluff down-to-earth image generally plays well in the countryside . 
but the economic crisis of the past five years has fuelled support among the population of 4.3 million for the intellectual Lucinschi . 
&quot; I &apos;m for Lucinschi , &quot; said Valya as she swept autumn leaves in front of her single-storey Chisinau house . 
&quot; My pension &apos;s only 50 lei ( about $ 10 ) a month and I don &apos;t always get it . 
in the village of Tintareni , most of a dozen or so voters interviewed said they wanted Lucinschi to win a four-year term . 
&quot; Snegur is to blame for the war in Dnestr and the economic problems , &quot; said Vasile . 
&quot; Lucinschi will make things better . 
but there is no shortage of Snegur loyalists . 
he gave us our independence , he knows what to do , &quot; said Glavia , a Chisinau housewife in her 40s . 
&quot; The problem is the government don &apos;t let him do what he needs to . 
Snegur wants greater presidential powers to carry out reforms . 
he dismisses fears among the one-third Russian minority that he might unite with Romania , from whose territory Stalin carved most of Moldova in World War Two . 
Lucinschi , also 56 and like the president a top communist in Soviet times , presents himself as a social democrat . 
he accuses Snegur of seeking vast powers in the manner of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and of stirring up the Dnestr war . 
playing down links with Bucharest , he reminds Moldovans they depend on Russia for their energy and much else .
