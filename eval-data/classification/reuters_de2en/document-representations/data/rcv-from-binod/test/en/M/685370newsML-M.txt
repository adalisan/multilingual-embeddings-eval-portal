IPE August Brent futures closed a hefty 34 cents higher at $ 18.21 a barrel on Wednesday but off pre-close highs on the back of news that OPEC solved the issued of quota compliance and agreed to freeze its production ceiling , traders said . 
August Brent surged in the last hour of trading from the red , breaking through the $ 18.00 barrier , to a session high of $ 18.45 after Iranian Oil Minister Gholamrezah Aghasadeh said the issue of quota compliance was solved at the OPEC meeting in Vienna . 
NYMEX , which rose slightly in the afteroon but soon lost steam , also rallied late in the day after the OPEC news broke and the WTI August contract closed 52 cents higher at $ 19.55 a barrel . 
&quot; The rise is all on the back of the headlines on OPEC , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing else there . 
OPEC Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman said the producer group had agreed to a freeze of its 25.033 million barrels per day ( bpd ) ceiling for six months . 
he said OPEC members agreed to go back to their production allocations and added &quot; no threats &quot; had been made to overproducers . 
Lukman confirmed all individual quotas have been left unchanged . 
but IPE traders said some selling set into the market towards the close by profit-takers and also by players fearing that some members of the cartel would not stick to their quotas . 
&quot; There was some profit taking towards the close and some pretty ambiguous statements from OPEC , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; There is some concern ( in the market ) that some OPEC members will not stick to the agreement . 
who &apos;s to say that Venezuela that has broken its quota in the past will stick to it , &quot; he added . 
but he said the trading volumes on August Brent at the higher numbers were good , adding it remains to be seem if these levels would hold on Thrusday , when OPEC will wrap up its meeting . 
earlier on Wednesday , IPE gas oil closed flat after testing the upside briefly in the afternoon on the back of a rising NYMEX complex that lost steam shortly afterwards , traders said . 
July gas oil ended unchanged at $ 160.25 a tonne , in the middle of a $ 2 range .
