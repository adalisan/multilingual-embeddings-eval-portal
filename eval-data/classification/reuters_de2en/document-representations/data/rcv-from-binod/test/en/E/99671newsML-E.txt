Chilean industrial production rose a scant 0.5 percent in August compared with the same month last year , while sales fell 0.7 percent over the same period , said the industrial trade group Sofofa . 
figures from Sofofa showed output in August was 0.4 percent lower than in July with sales dropping 2.5 percent . 
August &apos;s data brings the rise in industrial production in the first eight months of the year to 2.2 percent with sales up 2.6 percent . 
the figures , which add to recent government data showing a slowdown , are further signs of the cooling of Chile &apos;s robust economic growth as the result of a year-long Central Bank credit squeeze .
