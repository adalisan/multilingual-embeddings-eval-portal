&quot; shares extended their losses in the afternoon but the 1,900 support held and the index closed over that level . 
I expect the bearish mood to last tomorrow but the index is unlikely to close below 1,900 level , &quot; said Ayca Oral from EGS Securities . 
some brokers said the newly listed shares of Sabanci Holding , one of Turkey &apos;s leading industrial conglomerates undermined sentiment . 
&quot; The newcomer Sabanci shares retreated from a high of 6,600 to 6,100 lira despite previous expectations of higher premiums . 
this also caused sentiment to turn weaker , &quot; Toygar Sungur from Meksa Securities said .
