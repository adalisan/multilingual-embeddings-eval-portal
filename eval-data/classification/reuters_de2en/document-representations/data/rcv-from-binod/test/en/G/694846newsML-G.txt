Argentina &apos;s ruling Peronist Party made an all-out effort Sunday to patch up a damaging dispute between President Carlos Menem and the man who wants to succeed him in 1999 , Peronist governor of Buenos Aires Province Eduardo Duhalde . 
government officials revealed that the two men , running mates in the 1989 election that brought Menem to power , met in secret Friday night in search of a truce . 
then much of the national cabinet went to Duhalde &apos;s country home Sunday morning to discuss social issues with him . 
Interior Minister Carlos Corach told reporters the two most powerful men in the Peronist administration &quot; are working together and have a common strategy for a clear Peronist win &quot; in October &apos;s mid-term elections in Congress . 
that vote will set the scene for presidential elections in 1999 , when Menem is blocked from running for a third term and Duhalde has made no secret of his desire to succeed him . 
but Menem wants to avoid spending his last two years in power as a &quot; lame duck &quot; president . 
despite playing soccer together for the cameras and repeated denials of a spat , the Buenos Aires governor has been undermining Menem over social unrest and unemployment and in a growing scandal over controversial businessman Alfredo Yabran . 
Duhalde has criticised the social side-effects of Menem &apos;s economic reforms and sided with protests against 17.3 percent unemployment , while Menem has accused the same protesters of &quot; subversion &quot; . 
and Duhalde has called Yabran the &quot; main suspect &quot; for ordering the murder of news photographer Jose Luis Cabezas in January , while Menem has courted controversy by insisting he is innocent unless proven guilty and ordered his cabinet chief to receive Yabran in government house last Tuesday . 
but Corach said the two Peronist strongmen &apos;s relationship is &quot; excellent , as shown by the meeting Friday night &quot; and Duhalde , whose wife Hilda is running for Congress in October , told local radio &quot; there was never any personal fight , &quot; though he did admit to &quot; differences of opinion on social policy . 
some opposition figures believe that a scandal over alleged links between Menem &apos;s administration and the tycoon Yabran , who has been accused of heading a mafia , is the result of the struggle for power between Menem and Duhalde . 
the murder of Noticias magazine photographer Cabezas , which mobilised mass public protests , took place in Duhalde &apos;s province at a resort where he , half the government and Yabran spend their holidays . 
Yabran is being investigated for calls to his house from a policeman accused of pulling the trigger . 
Duhalde &apos;s police are carrying out the investigation and have leaked lists of phone calls made from Yabran &apos;s company to government house , Menem &apos;s brother Eduardo , Interior Minister Carlos Corach and over 100 calls to Justice Minister Elias Jassan , who had denied even knowing Yabran and had to quit this week .
