the Australian dollar won a pause from pressure Thursday as jobs data proved not to be the disaster bears were betting on , so putting a squeeze on shorts . 
employment rose 21,300 in July which was under forecasts of 25,000 but full-time jobs jumped 52,500 which was promising enough to take some of the heat out of rate cut speculation . 
nevertheless , the jobless rate did creep to 8.7 percent from 8.5 suggesting consumer confidence would remain depressed . 
net , analysts felt it was another case of monthly volatility around a flat trend which did nothing to settle the argument over rates and left the dollar just as handicapped as before . 
it was unchanged on Wednesday &apos;s close , however , reflecting market suspicions the figures had only temporarily reduced the risk of another official rate cut . 
dealers did see scope for further short covering given the market was broadly short heading into the data , but most felt there were far too many offers atop US $ 0.7420 to allow it any higher . 
that was a technical recipe for consolidation with a bias to the downside while under the key US $ 0.7440 level . 
the dollar had delved as deep as US $ 0.7330 overnight as bears bet the jobs data would be dire enough to substantially raise the risk of another policy easing , even though rates had been cut only last week . 
but although the actual figures frustrated those ambitions , they were far from strong enough that a cut could be ruled out . 
indeed , analysts noted the July rise in jobs combined with the 11,900 gain in June , still did not make up for May &apos;s shock 40,300 drop . 
the big jump in full-time employment looked more meaningful , but again only partially compensated for the 63,900 fall recorded in the first six months of the year . 
and the rise in the unemployment rate , while often ignored by the market , could well have an adverse impact on consumer psychology , especially if the media played it up . 
much of the recent softness in the economy has been attributed to consumers being too scared of losing their jobs to spend more money , and an unemployment rate of 8.7 percent was hardly likely to reassure them on that point . 
analysts expected the sober message to be reinforced by housing finance data on Friday , where private banking figures suggest a fall in commitments of around 5.0 percent was likely , even though median estimates were for a 2.0 percent rise . 
such a fall in June would be particularly disappointing since it suggested the rate cut of May 23 had little immediate impact on the housing market . 
on the crosses , short covering helped pare the dollar &apos;s offshore losses but it still eneded at 87.20 / 30 yen from 87.67 / 77 late here Wednesday . 
it was firmer on an ailing mark at 1.3876 / 92 from 1.3817 / 34 and also made ground on sterling which suffered a sharp selloff on talk the Bank of England would not hike rates today after all . 
in trade weighted terms it firmed to 58.0 from 57.9 .
