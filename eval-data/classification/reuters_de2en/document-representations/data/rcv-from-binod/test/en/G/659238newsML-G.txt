new Zealand search and rescue teams were looking on Monday for an object that flared through the sky over the Kapiti coast , north of Wellington , on Friday night . 
Carter Observatory spokesman John Field told the New Zealand Press Association that from the descriptions from people who saw the object , it was likely to be space debris . 
a bright burning object was seen to crash and explode in the hills behind Waikanae , north of Wellington . 
&quot; If it is a large chunk of rock it will probably be stony and look like any other rock . 
I doubt whether it would be large enough to make a crater , &quot; he said . 
field said the object could be as large as a basketball . 
police in the central North Island recorded several reports of lights in the sky . 
Auckland Senior Sergeant Chris Robinson said he had received more than 20 calls of sightings of a range of different-coloured objects .
