* Key March JGB futures end sharply down as market sentiment weakens after Bank of Japan cut amount of its outright bond purchases on Tuesday morning . 
* Long-liquidation by dealers pushed March further down towards close , a trust bank trader said . 
the March ended at 125.60 , down from Friday &apos;s 126.02 . 
turnover was 34,840 contracts . 
the reduction in the amount of the BOJ &apos;s outright bond purchases in the morning operation was due to an easing of the year-end fund shortage and a slowdown in bank note growth , a BOJ official said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Due to a slowdown in bank note growth , the BOJ adjusted the size of its outright bond purchase operation . 
also , following an easing of the year-end fund shortage , the BOJ decided it was appropriate to change the size for this operation , &quot; the official told Reuters . 
as for the BOJ &apos;s future plans , the official said : &quot; The BOJ would like to continue outright bond purchases at a twice-a-month pace . 
as for the amount , we will decide each time by taking into account a number of factors , such as bank notes . 
the BOJ is likely to reduce the amount of long-term bonds purchased at each outright bond buying operation to 100 billion yen from the current 200 billion yen for the time being , traders said . 
if interest rates rise significantly from current levels , the BOJ may increase the amount of purchases , they added .
