the South Korean gold market was expected to be quiet this week after a long holiday break , traders in Seoul said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Due to the long holiday , domestic bullion business has been very slow over the past week and demand is barely changed from last week , &quot; a trader with LG metals Corp said . 
the South Korean bullion market was closed last Thursday for Labour Day and on Monday for Children &apos;s Day . 
the LG trader said a slowdown in domestic economy following the collapse of Hanbo Steel and Sammi Steel would continue to depress gold demand . 
gold producer LG metals &apos; daily selling price for the precious metal , which is regarded as a benchmark for the local bullion wholesale market , rose on Tuesday to 10,250 won per gram from 10,150 won a week ago in line with a modest recovery in world market .

the telegraphic transfer selling rate for customers , posted by the Korea Exchange Bank , rose to 895.40 won against the dollar from 896.20 won a week ago . 
the rate is regarded as a benchmark of local foreign exchange rates for companies .
