Omar Barrios believes in his heart that his 5-year-old twins , Gabriela and Beruzca , are still alive under a 6-story office block that collapsed in Wednesday &apos;s earthquake . 
&quot; I know they &apos;re alive , I can feel it , &quot; Barrios , 49 , told a Reuters correspondent on Friday as he camped out in a plastic tent next to the wrecked Seguros la Seguridad building . 
&quot; I &apos;m just waiting for them to be rescued , &quot; he added , 43 hours after they were buried by the country &apos;s worst earthquake for 30 years . 
the Barrios family lived in a first-floor apartment in the office block in Cumana , the historic state capital of Sucre , and the twins were being looked after by 16-year-old babysitter Ismar Maestre , who is also missing . 
firemen have been pumping oxygen down through four stories of broken concrete and wrenched steel in the hope of keeping any trapped survivors alive . 
they stopped briefly on Thursday night to listen for telltale signs of life , but after straining for 10 minutes in the enforced silence , geologist Feliciano De Santis told Reuters : &quot; Nothing , there was too much ambient noise . 
twenty-two bodies have been pulled from rubble , and many more are feared buried in the quake that killed at least 68 people in eastern Venezuela , many of them children . 
rescuers said they were going in again to look for the twins , but played down hopes of finding them , or anyone else , alive . 
however , said De Santis , &quot; there &apos;s always the chance of a miracle , especially for small children who can squeeze into small protected air pockets .
