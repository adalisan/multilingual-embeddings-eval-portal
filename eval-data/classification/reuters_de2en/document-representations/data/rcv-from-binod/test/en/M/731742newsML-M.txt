Canadian spot natural gas prices eased again on Wednesday amid a continuing outage on the intra-Alberta pipeline system , a situation traders said could spell lower values after the weekend . 
a Calgary-based marketer said the continuing slide in prices while about one billion cubic feet of gas a day was off the NOVA Gas Transmission system and a heat wave gripped much of the United States suggested prices could sink by as much as 20 cents next week . 
the NOVA maintenance outage was expected to be completed by Friday . 
the outage has reduced the high recent volumes of storage injections in western Canada to 155 million cubic feet a day on Tuesday from levels of around one billion cubic feet a day earlier this summer . 
the story was similar in British Columbia , whose Westcoast Energy Inc pipeline system was packed up with gas amid the NOVA outage and the return to service two large unregulated gas plants in the province &apos;s northeast . 
day gas at Westcoast &apos;s compressor Station 2 was talked at C $ 1.49 / 1.51 per GJ , down about four cents on the day , with at least one large deal done as low as C $ 1.44 , sources said . 
&quot; There &apos;s no place for the gas to go . 
&apos; s feeling the heat of these outages , &quot; a trader of B.C. 
gas said . 
gas at Sumas , wash . , was discussed at US $ 1.18 / 1.19 per million British thermal units , down three-four cents from Tuesday . 
in the east , prices rose a few cents along with NYMEX prices and the U.S. Northeast &apos;s hot weather , traders said . 
gas at Niagara was quoted at US $ 2.39 / 2.40 per mmBtu , up about three cents .
