by the third quarter of 1996 Nigeria &apos;s military government will settle 5.0 billion naira from debts to local contractors of 13.1 billion naira , finance minister Anthony Ani said on Thursday . 
he said another 14.6 billion naira was owed for projects that are still ongoing . 
he did not mention when these debts would be repayed . 
&quot; In making payments , all debts below five million naira will be settled , whereas for debts over this amount , the first five million naira will be paid . 
the unpaid balances will be settled on pro-rata basis , &quot; Ani said . 
he said the government was considering issuing redeemable stocks and certificates in respect of unpaid debts after exhausting the five billion naira earmarked . 
for official transactions the government uses an exchange rate of $ 1 = 20 naira , but for all other transactions the open market rate of $ 1 = 80 naira is used .
