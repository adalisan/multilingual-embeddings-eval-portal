European bourses slipped in morning trading on Tuesday , taking their cue from Wall Street &apos;s latest fall , but London and Paris soon revived from their lows . 
on the foreign exchanges , the dollar lost a little ground amid caution on interest rates and after a shaky performance by U.S. stocks and bonds . 
but it was also above its lowest levels . 
Frankfurt , down 1.5 percent , showed the biggest drop of major bourses , with weakness of the dollar -- which sours prospects for Germany &apos;s many exporters -- a key depressant . 
&quot; We have lost what we gained yesterday but volumes are relatively weak . 
most players have had enough and just want to celebrate Christmas , &quot; said one German share dealer . 
&quot; All this volatility is putting people off , &quot; said a London trader . 
&quot; Everybody is very aware that markets are higher than they have ever been before and they &apos;re worried about buying at the top , though there &apos;s still a lot of cash around . 
U.S. shares were slightly firmer in London . 
&quot; Wall Street had a big fall late in the session which may have been a bit overdone , &quot; one London dealer said . 
currency traders were digesting pointers to German views on exchange rates after agreement on a European Union budget stability pact to back up a future single euro currency . 
&quot; The main thing underpinning the mark is that it now looks like the Germans are unhappy with the outcome of the EU summit , &quot; said Gerard Lyons , chief economist at DKB International . 
&quot; The French are arguing for political controls over the European central bank and interference in the workings of the single currency system , which is what they got in the stability pact , &quot; he said . 
the German central bank &apos;s chief economist , Otmar Issing , told the Financial Times he was not satisfied with a lack of automaticity in the stability pact underpinning planned European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) . 
new York markets weakened late on Monday as news of a solid 0.9 percent gain for U.S. industrial output last month jangled nerves ahead of a meeting on Tuesday of the the U.S. central bank &apos;s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) . 
&quot; People seem to be watching the outcome of the FOMC but it &apos;s difficult to see any change in rates just yet , &quot; said Henry Wilkes , senior trader at Bank Julius Baer . 
&quot; No one is expecting a change in rates ahead of Christmas , &quot; a London share trader said . 
&quot; If there is one , it will catch everybody by surprise . 
the London stock market , Europe &apos;s busiest , opened lower , depressed by a late sell-off in technology stocks in New York which neutralised much of the impact of Boeing &apos;s $ 13.3 billion acquisition of fellow aerospace giant McDonnell Douglas . 
but takeover talk later helped it revive from its lows . 
&quot; We have been taken to these levels purely on the back of takeover possibilities in the financial sector , &quot; a trader said . 
investors are worried about a further slide on Wall Street and the chances of a year-end rally are fading , analysts said . 
&quot; If there is going to be one ( a rally ) , it will be very , short-lived , &quot; a London dealer said . 
&quot; People will just be pleased if the market hangs on to these levels at the end of the year . 
Frankfurt shares were hit by a weaker dollar and Wall Street &apos;s fall , while French shares were above the day &apos;s lows with investors sidelined ahead of U.S. central bank meeting . 
&quot; It is very quiet . 
dealers are free-wheeling and many fund managers are already on holiday , &quot; one Paris dealer said . 
Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet will later outline the bank &apos;s monetary policy goals . 
economists expect him to avoid controversy but say he might hint at more rate cuts . 
among currency comments being analysed by traders , the Bundesbank &apos;s latest report said exchange rates broadly reflected fundamental factors and the mark had completely corrected a prolonged period of strength in recent years . 
on Monday German finance ministry official Michael Roeskau said a dollar rate of 1.55 marks -- marginally above rates on Tuesday morning -- was one which could be defended on markets . 
the dollar was quoted around 1.5475 marks and 113.90 yen , compared with 1.5510 and 114.29 in late business on Monday . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index was down 7.76 at 2,214.81 . 
the Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.52 to 6,268.35 on Monday , reversing earlier gains . 
it was up 31 as London closed . 
gold fixed at $ 368.30 and then rose to $ 368.55 , up from the previous $ 367.55 close . 
silver edged up a cent to $ 4.81 .
