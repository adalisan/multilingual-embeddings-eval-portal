Tokyo naphtha prices were steady on Tuesday despite modest losses in crude oil prices overnight , due partly to active buying by one Japanese trading house , dealers said . 
Open-spec naphtha for first-half March delivery was assessed at $ 236.00 / 237.00 in late afternoon , after a Japanese trader bought first-half March cargoes once at $ 235.75 , again at $ 236.00 , and again at $ 236.75 . 
Second-half February was quoted at $ 239.50 / 241.25 , little changed from late Friday &apos;s levels . 
the Tokyo oil products market was closed on Monday for a national holiday . 
the shutdown of Japan Atomic Power Co &apos;s 1.16 million kilowatt nuclear reactor set a bullish tone in the domestic fuel oil market as electric utilities are expected to raise operating rates at their thermal power plants , traders said . 
they added , however , that the closure is unlikely to boost low sulphur waxy residue imports sharply as Singapore prices remain substantially higher than prices for domestic cargoes . 
Japan Atomic started shutting down the reactor at noon on Tuesday due to a cooling water leak . 
the reactor is scheduled to come to a total halt by midnight .
