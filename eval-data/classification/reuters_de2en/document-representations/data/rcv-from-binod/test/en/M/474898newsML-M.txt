the central Bank of Korea ( BOK ) plans to absorb one trillion won from the banking system through repurchase agreements ( repos ) maturing next Monday , a BOK official said on Friday . 
Repos are bonds issued by the central bank to control money in circulation . 
&quot; Banks with abundant short-term liquidity asked the central bank to siphon off surplus money in circulation , &quot; the official said . 
he said market liquidity would remain stable despite the repos . 
but the central bank was considering releasing funds in early April to help companies pay taxes , he added .
