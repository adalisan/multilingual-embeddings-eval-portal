CME lumber futures rose at the start but trended down for pared gains in early dealings , traders said . 
lumber started up on carryover demand prompted by word Canfor Corp will be taking downtime at four of its British Columbia sawmills starting in mid-June , and on reports of increased demand for lumber at the lower price levels . 
however , demand lacked followthrough and prices slipped , traders said . 
one lumber analyst noted that the Canfor mill downtime was not bullish but actually bearish due to high production . 
&quot; What it really says is they are making way too much wood for the market to obsorb so I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s terribly bullish and it might be construed just the opposite , &quot; said curt Cunningham , President Pacific futures Trading . 
at 0942 CDT , lumber stood $ 4.40 to $ 1.90 per tbf higher with July up most at $ 385.00 and September up $ 2.00 at $ 375.00 per tbf .
