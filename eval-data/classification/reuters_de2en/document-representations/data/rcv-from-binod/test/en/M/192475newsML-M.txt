Yen-based Tokyo precious metals futures ended weaker on Friday in lacklustre trade , pressured by lower spot prices and the yen &apos;s firmer tendency against the dollar , traders said . 
gold futures ranged from seven to 12 yen per gram lower . 
Most-active benchmark October was eight yen lower at 1,353 yen . 
price losses were partly offset by scattered bargain-hunting , but activity was hampered by uncertainty over the near-term trend in the currency market , the traders said . 
spot gold was quoted at $ 381.35 / 381.65 per ounce at the Tokyo close , against $ 381.00 / 381.40 in New York on Thursday . 
little activity was noted in the spot gold market . 
&quot; As long as U.S. stocks keep firming , there will be no opportunity for gold to shine , &quot; one senior dealer at a foreign bank said . 
&quot; Gold could probe the downside at $ 380 per ounce amid a lack of bullish factors , &quot; the dealer said . 
in the platinum futures market , private investors generally retreated to the sidelines , and activity was dominated by sporadic inter-month trade in line with the currency market . 
one trader said the upside of platinum futures was likely to be capped by long-liquidation , as there were massive long positions still held by private investors . 
platinum futures ranged from five yen to 16 yen per gram lower , with most-active benchmark October finishing five yen weaker at 1,376 yen . 
traders said the Japanese physical palladium market showed signs of improvement as a result of stock adjustments . 
&quot; reflecting a slight improvement in the physical market , investors hunted for bargains , &quot; one trader said . 
benchmark October palladium was flat at 430 yen . 
benchmark October silver was down 1.8 yen per 10 grams at 177.2 yen .
