North Sea crude oil markets saw little action on Tuesday but differentials were holding strong and showed little signs of coming off in the short term , traders said . 
&quot; Most of the ( July ) North Sea crudes went last week . 
there &apos;s hardly anything left in the first half of the month and refiners are not interested in looking into the third decade yet , &quot; one North Sea equity holder said . 
outright levels tumbled on news that the Iraqi oil minister Amir Rasheed said that the country expected to resume exporting oil in the next week to ten days . 
the single Brent cargo in the paper chains on Tuesday was kept before the five o &apos; clock deadline by Stasco and was not expected to reappear on the market . 
a cargo of Brent crude was heard offered at August -15 cents and with few barrels available , many saw it an achievable level . 
a mid-July Ekofisk traded earlier at a steady dated Brent + 20 cents while a Forties July 13-15 ( 600Kb ) moved at an undisclosed price . 
equity holders saw no Forties cargoes available before the 15th of July and only three in the 15-20 period . 
Oseberg and Statfjord barrels were cleared out up to the beginning of the third decade . 
CFDs lost ground over the day in an extremely quiet market and fell further with the losses on the IPE . 
next week &apos;s June 30-04 dates were offered at Aug -34 cents with the best bid three cents lower . 
late talk on the July 7-11 dates was at Aug -38 / -35 cents though no deals were reported . 
Intermonth spreads fell back around two cents from earlier deals at -15 cents for July / Aug and -16 cents for Sep / Oct . 
in late trade the Aug / Sep spread moved twice at -19 cents .
