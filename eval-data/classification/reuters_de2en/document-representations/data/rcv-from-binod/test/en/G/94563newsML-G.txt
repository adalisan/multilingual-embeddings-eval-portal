Britain &apos;s opposition Labour party , seeking to avert another Dunblane massacre , promised on Thursday to ban private ownership of handguns if it wins the coming general election . 
in a speech to the party &apos;s annual conference , home affairs spokesman Jack Straw also declared war on drug-related crime . 
Britain &apos;s streets could become as mean as America &apos;s unless Labour tackled crime and the inequalities that spawned it . 
&quot; We can &apos;t go on like this , &quot; said Straw , whose party has been taking a harder line on law and order to outflank the ruling Conservatives in the run-up to the election , due by next May . 
&quot; If you want a picture of what it could be like , of what happens if you don &apos;t get tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime , then look across the Atlantic . 
&quot; Look to see the wealthy barricade themselves in suburban fortresses , the poor trapped in ghettoes , millions owning guns for their self-defence and a prison population which has tripled in two decades , &quot; Straw said . 
he said a Labour government would make sweeping changes to Britain &apos;s gun laws to avert a repeat of the Dunblane massacre in March , when a lone gunman mowed down 16 children and their teacher in a Scottish primary school before killing himself . 
labour , in opposition since 1979 , would ban the private ownership and possession of all handguns , end mail order sales , ban all under-18s from holding airguns and shotguns , and introduce a stricter gun licensing system . 
&quot; We cannot have a society which values the right of civilians to own a handgun more than that of a child to a future , &quot; Straw said to loud applause . 
delegates later stood in a minute &apos;s silence to the victims of Dunblane after hearing an impassioned speech from Ann Pearston , who has been leading a campaign since the massacre for a total ban on handguns . 
&quot; We must shut the door on public safety tight -- so that it can &apos;t be pushed wider by the very powerful gun lobby in years to come , &quot; Pearston said . 
on drugs , Straw pledged to make addicts undergo treatment and random drug tests in a bid to break the link with crime . 
straw said : &quot; With heroin addicts thieving daily to fund their habit , at a cost of well over one billion pounds ( $ 1.5 billion ) in property stolen each year , it is time call a halt to this vicious circle of addiction and crime .
