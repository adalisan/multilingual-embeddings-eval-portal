two goals from midfielder Sylvain Legwinski helped French league leaders Monaco clinch a 3-0 precious away win in Rennes on Thursday . 
five days before hosting Newcastle for their UEFA Cup quarter-final second leg , Monaco now lead the table with 59 points while arch-rivals Paris St Germain , who travel to lowly Le Havre on Friday , are trailing seven points behind . 
the team from the principality , who were held to a goalless draw by title holders Auxerre last week-end , showed their mental strength by crushing the Brittany side who could hardly cope with Monaco &apos;s skillfull play . 
Legwinski opened the score 10 minutes before the interval with a shot from close range after a run from Brazilian striker Anderson . 
Rennes reacted swiftly and tried hard to close the gap through striker Stephane Guirvarc &apos;h but Monaco substitute keeper Stephane Porato made a dramatic save in the 45th minute . 
after the break , Legwinski exploited a defensive mistake to score his second before Scotland &apos;s John Collins put the issue beyond doubt in the 67th from a cross by Anderson .
