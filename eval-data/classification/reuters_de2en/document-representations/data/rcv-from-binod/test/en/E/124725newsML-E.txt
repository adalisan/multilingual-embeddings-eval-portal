Iraq said on Thursday it hoped to sign trade deals at a business fair in Baghdad next month even though these depended on a stalled oil-for-food agreement with the United Nations . 
trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saled said 16 countries and 45 multinational companies would attend the trade fair in Baghdad from November 1 for 15 days . 
&quot; So far 16 countries have announced their participation in the fair , twice the number last year , &quot; Saleh told a news conference . 
among these countries were China , Turkey , South Korea , Greece , Jordan , Algeria , Yemen , Tunisia and others . 
&quot; forty-five companies are attending -- an increase of two and half fold on last year &apos;s participation , &quot; Saleh said , adding that French , Chinese , Russian , Indian , Turkish and Egyptian firms and others from the former Soviet bloc were attending . 
the minister said Iraq was ready to conclude trade deals with these companies under an &quot; oil-for-food &quot; deal Iraq signed with the United Nations on May 20 . 
the deal , stalled over security reasons in Iraq &apos;s north caused by fighting between Kurdish factions with Iraq &apos;s participation initially , allows Baghdad oil sales worth $ 2 billion every six months to buy food and medicine . 
the Iraqi population has suffered under tough U.N. sanctions sor six years imposed for Iraq &apos;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
&quot; Yes , the Ministry of Trade and other ministries are ready to sign contracts with these companies and countries ... based on the oil-for-food and medicine agreement with the United Nations , &quot; Saleh said . 
Saleh said Iraq &apos;s trade with Jordan would continue . 
&quot; Our trade with Jordan is continuing unabated , &quot; he said . 
trade between Baghdad and Amman reached its lowest ebb last year when Jordan provided refuge to two senior Iraqi defectors , killed in Baghdad soon after their return home last February . 
Jordan &apos;s King Hussein has distanced himself from Iraq , mending ties with both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , diehard enemies of Baghdad . 
Iraq supplies Jordan with oil . 
under a deal signed last year , Baghdad is to supply Amman with 4.4 million tonnes of crude and byproducts in 1996 . 
&quot; We have no amendment to our trade dealing with Jordan , &quot; Saleh said . 
Saleh lauded Iraq &apos;s trade relations with Egypt saying that 25 Egyptian firms would attend the fair . 
&quot; Trade relations with Egypt are continuing ... We buy rice from Egyptian companies , &quot; he said .
