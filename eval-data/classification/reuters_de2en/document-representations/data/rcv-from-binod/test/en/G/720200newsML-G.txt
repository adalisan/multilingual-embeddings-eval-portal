the European Commission reopened inquiries into alleged dumping of unbleached cotton imports from six countries on Thursday , setting the stage for another internal tussle over the bloc &apos;s anti-dumping tactics . 
&quot; The decision to open the cotton inquiries was approved , &quot; a Commission official told Reuters . 
renewed Commission inquiries into grey cotton fabric from China , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Pakistan and Turkey followed a complaint by Eurocoton , the Committee of the Cotton and allied Textile Industries of the European Union . 
Thursday &apos;s decision , to be published in the EU &apos;s Official Journal during the coming days , said initial work by Commission officials revealed evidence of &quot; substantial &quot; dumping margins for fabric imports from the six countries named . 
it reopens a file closed only last May when a majority of EU trade ministers rejected the Commission &apos;s case for setting definitive dumping duties against the same six countries . 
Eurocoton reacted furiously at the time , saying the ministers had acted unlawfully and vowing to consider legal action in the European Court of Justice . 
the measures ministers rejected would have hit imports from the six named countries worth 379 million European currency units ( $ 424 million ) in 1995 . 
those proposals would have hit Chinese-origin imports with 18.9 percent duties , those from Egypt with 13 percent , India 17.2 percent , Indonesia 14.5 percent , Pakistan 22.9 percent and Turkey 17.5 percent .
