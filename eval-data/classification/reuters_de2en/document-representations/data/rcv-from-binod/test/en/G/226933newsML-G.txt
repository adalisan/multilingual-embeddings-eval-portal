VfB Stuttgart &apos;s Brazilian striker Giovane Elber launched a fierce attack on Bayern Munich after the two clubs drew 1-1 in a highly-charged top-of-the-table clash in the German first division on Sunday . 
&quot; It will be bad for German football if Bayern win the championship . 
the way they play is not good , &quot; said Elber , one of the most impressive forwards in the Bundesliga this season with 10 goals in 16 games . 
&quot; After their early lead they just waited . 
they did not seem to have the urge to play football ... Bayern were afraid . 
we can &apos;t be happy . 
Stuttgart , the most impressive team of the first half of the season , needed an 80th-minute goal from Dutch captain Frank Verlaat to avoid a home defeat after Bayern went ahead in the seventh-minute with a penalty from Germany midfielder Mario Basler . 
the south German derby was often a bad-tempered affair and VfB had to play the last nine minutes with 10 men after midfielder Gerhard Poschner was sent off for complaining to the referee . 
Bayern lost the top spot in the Bundesliga to Bayer Leverkusen , who beat Cologne 4-2 on Saturday . 
but only goal difference separates the two teams before next weekend &apos;s final round of matches ahead of the winter break . 
Stuttgart slipped down one place to third , two points behind the leading duo and just ahead of defending champions Borussia Dortmund on goal difference . 
VfB have played some attractive , attacking football this season . 
but they seemed to lose their composure in front of a capacity 53,000 crowd , spending too much time complaining to the referee instead of trying to outsmart their opponents . 
although Stuttgart &apos;s former Bayern defender Thomas Berthold clearly handled the ball on the ground to give away the penalty , Elber was annoyed with the performance of referee Hartmut Strampe . 
&quot; Some of the things he did were a joke . 
it could have been a good game but the referee did not allow it . 
it was ridiculous , &quot; he said . 
Berthold was the most unfortunate player on a freezing night in southern Germany . 
the 1990 World Cup-winning defender almost put VfB ahead in the fifth minute when his header hit the post after a brilliant dribble and cross from the right from Elber . 
but just two minutes later the often controversial defender got his side into trouble , handling the ball in the area under pressure from Bayern &apos;s Italian striker Ruggiero Rizzitelli . 
Basler slotted the penalty perfectly into the left-hand corner . 
Stuttgart , who until this season have failed to make an impact in the Bundesliga since they last won the title in 1992 , took the game to the Bavarians , especially in the second half . 
their intense pressure was finally rewarded when Verlaat fired the ball into the corner from close range after a cross from the right from substitute Andreas buck . 
&quot; I can &apos;t be happy with the result because we were the better team as far as chances were concerned , &quot; Stuttgart coach Joachim Loew said . 
but Bayern &apos;s Italian trainer Giovanni Trapattoni added : &quot; I am satisfied because my team showed character . 
national team captain Juergen Klinsmann , returning to the ground where he made his name in Germany with Stuttgart in the 1980s , had a disappointing match and was substituted in the second half .
