Britain &apos;s two main parties kicked off the final week of electioneering on Thursday with lurid warnings to voters of the dangers of putting their cross in the wrong box on May 1 . 
all promises to eschew negative campaigning were tossed aside as the ruling Conservatives accused the main opposition Labour Party of preparing an emergency tax-raising budget if they regain power for the first time since 1979 . 
labour said it would end its campaign by pushing a positive agenda for change but also warned that , if the Conservatives won a fifth straight term in office , they would abolish the state pension and break up the National Health Service . 
&quot; The choice is very simple . 
either you will wake up on May 2 to the same old Tories ... who would have the licence to do anything they wanted over the next five years , or a new start under Labour , &quot; Labour leader Tony Blair told a news conference . 
&quot; The same old Tories , with their sleaze , damage to pensions , law and order , and damaging the future of our young people , or new hope under Labour . 
that is the choice , &quot; he said . 
opinion polls have turned erratic in the past week , but most show Labour with a strong lead of around 20 percentage points . 
however , with evidence that support for Labour among floating voters is softer than Blair would like , strategists said they had no scruples about reminding voters of what they see as the dangers of re-electing the Conservatives . 
Prime Minister John Major , whose status as election underdog has left him more time to attack his opponents , said Labour was proposing &quot; to fill the last week of the election frightening the sick , the elderly and the vulnerable by spreading deliberate fibs and scare stories they know we have denied &quot; . 
major , at his daily news conference , appealed to voters to give his government credit for Britain &apos;s low inflation and falling employment and said Labour &apos;s itch to raise taxes risked derailing the economic recovery . 
the prime minister said Labour had a &quot; black hole &quot; in its spending plans of 12 billion pounds ( $ 19.5 billion ) that would have to be filled by raising taxes . 
&quot; Labour must level with the British people , tell the truth about what they would do in July , &quot; Major &apos;s finance minister , Kenneth Clarke , said . 
labour has vowed not to raise income tax rates for five years and to stick to the Conservative &apos;s tough spending limits for the next two years in an attempt to bury its old reputation as a tax-and-spend party . 
the only tax it plans to levy is on the excess profits of Britain &apos;s privatised utilities to fund a three-billion-pound programme to get 250,000 young people off welfare and into work . 
Blair listed other key pledges that he said proved Labour would make a difference to the man in the street -- smaller school class sizes , a clampdown on juvenile crime , shorter hospital waiting lists and a pledge not to join a single European currency without the approval of a referendum . 
he said Labour under his moderate leadership offered a third way , through what he called the &quot; radical centre &quot; , between old left-wing policies such as nationalisation and right-wing Conservatism where everything was left to market forces . 
anxious to dispel the charge that Labour , having ditched its socialist ballast , was now an empty vessel , Blair said voters faced a real choice on May 1 . 
&quot; You can either have a two-tier society or you can rebuild this country as one nation under New Labour . 
that is the message that we will take out to the country in the next seven days , &quot; Blair said .
