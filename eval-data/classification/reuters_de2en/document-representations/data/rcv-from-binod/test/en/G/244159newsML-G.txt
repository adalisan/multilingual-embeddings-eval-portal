Prime Minister John Major faced fresh turmoil in his divided Conservative party on Monday when a prominent &quot; Eurosceptic &quot; member of parliament called for a referendum on whether Britain should quit the European Union . 
maverick Conservative Teresa Gorman said she would introduce a bill in parliament on January 21 calling for an immediate plebiscite , guaranteeing the fractures in Major &apos;s party over links with Europe will dominate headlines for weeks to come . 
by announcing the move just one day after Major made a strong plea for party unity in the run-up to the next election , Gorman underlined that Major could not expect hardline &quot; Eurosceptics &quot; to keep quiet over their number one concern . 
Gorman , backed by fellow Eurosceptics Sir Teddy Taylor and John Wilkinson , claimed that a referendum could be a unifying force in the party by allowing its warring wings to accept that the will of the British people would prevail . 
&quot; No democratic Conservative would go against the majority opinion . 
this is in no sense incompatible with what the prime minister said ... yesterday , &quot; Wilkinson told a news conference . 
major , whose one-seat parliamentary majority vanished when a disaffected Conservative MP withdrew support last week over a hospital ward closure , vowed on Sunday he would not be held to ransom by &quot; maverick &quot; Eurosceptics intent on making trouble . 
but with opinion polls showing a haemorrhage of support from the Conservatives -- one put them 37 points behind Labour -- Gorman said a referendum could swing voters back to the party . 
&quot; People on both sides of the political fence are frustrated because they are not being asked for their opinion . 
Gorman and Wilkinson said they had no plans to quit the Conservative Party because of Major &apos;s reiteration of his &quot; wait and see &quot; policy on a single European currency . 
&quot; It would be pointless for us to do that , &quot; Gorman said . 
Gorman will introduce the bill under the so-called 10-minute rule which gives MPs an opportunity to discuss matters of importance . 
but the bill has almost no chance of becoming law . 
both the Conservatives and the opposition Labour party have pledged a referendum on joining a single European currency after the next election -- which Major plans to call no later than May 1 -- if the government first agrees Britain should join . 
billionaire businessman Sir James Goldsmith has founded a single-issue political party which will fight the election on a platform of a referendum on ties with Europe . 
he is attracting support from right-wing Conservative voters disillusioned with Major &apos;s attitude to the EU . 
labour Party leader Tony Blair said Major &apos;s attempts to unite the Conservatives over Europe were already crumbling . 
&quot; It just isn &apos;t in the interests of the country to have a government stumbling , limping on with its factions simply tearing it apart , &quot; Blair said . 
the government is expected to be hit again at a by-election on Thursday in Barnsley , northern England , which Labour is all but certain to win , cementing Major &apos;s minority in parliament .
