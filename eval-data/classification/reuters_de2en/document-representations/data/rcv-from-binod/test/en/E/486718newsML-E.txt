Bulgaria can overcome its grave economic crisis in some two years if radical measures are taken to liberalise the economy and restore confidence in the Lev , said former Polish finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz . 
Balcerowicz , also known as the architect of a tough shock therapy used to restructure Poland &apos;s embattled economy in the early 1990s , was on a two-day visit to Sofia to advise on urgently-needed reforms . 
&quot; Eliminating inflation is a matter of months . 
once ( financial ) discipline is imposed and sustained and the economy rapidly privatised , progress can be achieved in a year or two , but the effect will come later , &quot; Balcerowicz told reporters . 
cumulative inflation for the first two months of this year is 392 percent . 
he saw restoring confidence in the national currency along with price liberalisation , rapid privatisation and strengthening of institutions as paramount to creating conditions for subsequent economic growth . 
&quot; I think that Bulgaria &apos;s economic strategy is a sound one and the right one . 
it is very important once a government is formed to act rapidly and decisively , &quot; he said after meeting President Petar Stoyanov on Friday . 
under a $ 510 million 14-month IMF standby accord agreed last month , Bulgaria pledged to introduce a fixed exchange rate system known as a currency board in June to restore confidence in its collapsing financial system . 
under the agreement the caretaker government , is expected to make preparations for implementation of the currency board system by the new government and parliament to be formed after the April 19 general elections . 
&quot; Once you launch radical reforms and sustain them there will aslo be social costs and it is important to inform the people of the choices ... there will be unemployment , but there will also be prospects , &quot; said Balcerowicz . 
Bulgaria &apos;s jobless are expected to rise by yearend by some 160,000 or to 17.2 percent of the total workforce structural reforms take place , the social wellfare ministry said . 
the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) board is expected to review the cabinet &apos;s preparations for the currency board and consider disbursing the first tranche of the standby on April 11 . 
the system would require levs in circulation to be matched by central bank reserves , severely curbing the financial powers of the government and the central bank and preventing the printing of money . 
Balcerowicz , 50 , now head of the opposition Union for Freedom ( UW ) , said he would not take a job in Bulgaria but saw it as his moral duty to help . 
the liberal Polish economist , as a member of the first Solidarity government after the 1989 fall of communism , launched reforms that overcame hyper-inflation and , removing subsidies to industry , laid the basis for a market economy . 
unlike Bulgaria , which delayed fundamental reforms for seven years , Poland is now enjoying one of the highest economic growth rates in Europe although many Poles recall the first reforms as a frightening time of hardship in which real incomes dropped and unemployment rose sharply .
