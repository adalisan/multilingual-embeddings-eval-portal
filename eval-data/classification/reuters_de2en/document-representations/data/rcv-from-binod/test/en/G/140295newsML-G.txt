Philippine peace activists have launched an international campaign to persuade Manila to lift its ban on a visit by the East Timorese resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta , a leader of the group said on Thursday . 
university of the Philippines professor Walden bello said he hoped the campaign , combined with efforts to seek a court order reversing the government action , would generate enough pressure on President Fidel Ramos to revoke the ban . 
&quot; Hopefully , the government will realise that banning Mr Ramos-Horta would be tantamount to a political disaster , &quot; he said . 
Manila banned this year &apos;s Nobel peace laureate from entering the country during next month &apos;s summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , saying his presence might disrupt the APEC meeting . 
Ramos-Horta has been invited to speak on East Timor at an international conference of non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) to be held in parallel with the APEC summit . 
one of the leaders expected to attend the November 25 summit is Indonesian President Suharto . 
Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the next year in a move never accepted by the United Nations . 
Ramos-Horta , who lives in exile in Sydney , was denied a visa on Thursday when he applied at the Philippine consulate there . 
bello , a leader of a group of activists organising the NGO meeting , said the international campaign would involve appeals by NGOs in APEC economies for their leaders to boycott the summit . 
&quot; We are also asking members of parliaments and notable personalities in those countries to write letters to President Ramos to reverse his decision , &quot; bello said by telephone . 
Manila human rights lawyers were also preparing a petition to ask the Philippine Supreme Court to nullify the ban , he said . 
as part of the campaign , the Bangkok-based Forum-Asia human rights group has sent an open letter to President Ramos expressing its &quot; deep concern &quot; over the ban . 
&quot; We do not like to think that you are doing this because of the pressure of Indonesia , &quot; Forum-Asia secretary general Somchai Homlaor said in his letter , a copy of which was released to reporters by a Manila human rights group .
