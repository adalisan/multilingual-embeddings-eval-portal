at least 10,000 people filed past the embalmed body of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti on Monday to say a last goodbye to the maverick Nigerian musician who died of AIDS . 
&quot; Fela lives forever , &quot; said a banner fluttering in front of the platform on which was laid the corpse of the composer , singer and saxophonist who created the Afrobeat sound and popularised the continent &apos;s music across the globe . 
the mood in Lagos was anything but sombre as hundreds of fans waving leafy branches followed the hearse through the streets of the commercial capital from the square where his body was put on show to his club , The Shrine . 
Fela &apos;s band , Egypt 80 , blasted out old hits from the back of a truck . 
Anikulapo-Kuti , known to his fans simply as Fela , died of heart failure related to AIDS on August 2 . 
he was 58 . 
a star of the Nigerian and international music scene in the 1970s and 1980s , Fela won a reputation for smoking marijuana , sleeping with large numbers of women and dressing only in his underpants . 
Fela &apos;s emaciated body , on this occasion dressed in tight-fitting yellow trousers , multi-coloured shirt and black leather shoes , lay in a plain glass casket as people filed past . 
&quot; We will all miss you Fela , we will all miss you , because you fought for social justice , &quot; said Bayo Martins , one of Nigeria &apos;s leading drummers , as he moved past . 
Fela got under the skin of succesive military regimes with songs that portrayed soldiers as being below average intelligence . 
he was detained on numerous occasions for a variety of offences and spent time in jail . 
but for the last two years Fela did not publicly challenge current military strongman General Sani Abacha , even though his younger brother , activist Beko Ransome-Kuti is serving a prison sentence for allegedly taking part in a coup plot . 
as the most well-known Nigerian to have died of AIDS , Fela has drawn attention to the spread of HIV infection , which causes the disease , through Africa &apos;s most populous nation of over 100 million people . 
&quot; The response so far has been very encouraging , &quot; said Fela &apos;s doctor brother , Olikoye Ransome-Kuti , who called on Nigerians to take AIDS seriously when he announced the cause of Fela &apos;s death . 
Fela is to be buried on Tuesday at his home in the working class Ikeja district .
