the Venezuelan Bolivar closed firmer against the dollar at 474.75 / 475.75 per dollar as investors continued to sell dollars to buy TEMs , traders said . 
on Monday the unit ended at 475 / 476 per dollar . 
&quot; More dollars could possibly come in tomorrow , both for TEMs and the stock market -- if the Bolsa keeps rising , &quot; said one trader . 
TEM yields are widely expected to fall up to 100 basis points at Wednesday &apos;s regular Central Bank auction due to excess liquidity in Venezuelan money markets . 
benchmark six month TEMs yielded 18.45 percent at last week &apos;s auction . 
Venezuelan stocks gained some one percent Tuesday , reversing a straight six day slide .
