the British consumer enjoyed another spending spree in March , confirming the picture of robust domestic demand but the conditions facing the export sector are altogether gloomier , data on Wednesday showed . 
retail sales rose a monthly 0.3 percent in March and were a hefty 4.0 percent above sales in March 1996 , compared with 4.3 percent in February , the Office for National Statistics said . 
the data were in line with expectations and supported claims by the ruling Conservatives , facing an uphill battle for the May 1 election , that Britain is booming . 
but analysts say the signs of continued strength of domestic demand have underlined the need for whichever party wins the election -- the opposition Labour Party is currently odds-on favourite -- to carry out a speedy tightening of UK monetary and fiscal policy . 
if the ruling party ducks the issue , then there is little chance the country will get retail price inflation down to the official target of 2.5 percent or less and keep it there , analysts said . 
the retail sales figures showed high spending on items such as household goods and clothing which have seen sharp price rises recently , hinting that the days of bargain-hungry consumers keeping inflation at bay may be numbered . 
&quot; With signs consumers are growing less price sensitive and our expectation that retail sales growth will pick up to around 5.0 percent this year , this is not good news for inflation , &quot; said Adrian Cole , UK economist at James Capel . 
in the short term , the inflation outlook is healthy with a Confederation of British industry survey suggesting manufacturers do not , on balance , see a rise in average domestic prices over the next four months . 
but the organisation is nevertheless worried that the economy is on the brink of overheating and added its voice to the demands for measures to slow demand . 
&quot; We believe that some tightening of the economy is necessary , either by interest rates or through the fiscal side , &quot; Andrew Buxton , chairman of the CBI &apos;s economic affairs committee said , adding he would prefer fiscal tightening . 
the survey showed that while domestic orders had increased in the four months to April by the fastest rate for two years , export orders had registered their sharpest decline since late 1993 . 
exports have been undermined by the strength of the pound against major currencies , which makes British goods more expensive abroad and the CBI is afraid raising interest rates would boost the pound still further , exacerbating the problems of exporters . 
but minutes from the March 5 monthly monetary meeting , also released on Wednesday , showed that Bank of England Governor Eddie George was still insisting interest rates needed to rise by 1 / 4 point immediately to check inflation despite sterling . 
he argued that the strength of the pound might be only temporary and should not be used as an excuse for putting off an interest rate rise . 
doing so could mean interest rates would eventually have to rise by a more substantial amount . 
however , Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said it was impossible to ignore the deflationary implications of sterling &apos;s rise and said that consumer demand was growing at a sustainable rate . 
he therefore decided to leave interest rates unchanged &quot; for the moment , &quot; the minutes said . 
the next monthly monetary meeting is scheduled for May 7 and analysts expect rates to rise either at that meeting or the following one as the new government tries to establish its anti-inflation credentials .
