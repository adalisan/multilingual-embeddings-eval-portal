a Massachusetts prosecutor , angered by delays in the probe of an alleged affair between an underage babysitter and one of the sons of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy , has told witnesses to talk to him now or face a grand jury later , the Boston Herald reported Thursday . 
citing unnamed sources , the newspaper said Norfolk County District Attorney Jeffrey Locke would continue to press ahead with his investigation into the alleged affair between Michael Kennedy and the family &apos;s babysitter , which prosecutors say began when the now 19-year-old college student was 14 . 
Locke &apos;s spokeswoman Nina Flaherty declined comment . 
Massachusetts state police assigned to Locke &apos;s office have contacted game wardens in Maine about rafting trips Kennedy took with the babysitter in 1994 and 1995 , the Herald said . 
the investigation into the allegations that Kennedy had a 4-1 / 2 year affair with his children &apos;s babysitter has become a political albatross for his brother , U.S. Representative Joseph Kennedy II , who wants to run for Massachusetts governor in 1998 . 
the congressman &apos;s standing in recent polls against his probable Democratic primary opponent , Attorney General Scott Harshbarger , show his support slipping .
