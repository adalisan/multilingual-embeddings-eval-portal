Russian intelligence officials said on Wednesday that Moscow-Washington ties face serious harm in a spy row over the arrest of an ex-Soviet KGB agent in the United States last month . 
Kremlin spymasters are furious over the former agent &apos;s arrest , on a New York visit after openly acknowledging his old profession . 
they accuse their American counterparts of breaking &quot; rules of the game &quot; of espionage between the former Cold War foes . 
&quot; We would not like to do anything to dent the relationships between the two countries or even harm the two countries themselves , but we will have to retaliate in an adequate way , &quot; Tatyana Samolis , a spokeswoman for the Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) , told Reuters . 
Samolis said a response could be approved this week by the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , responsible for counterintelligence . 
she said the case was a breach of an understanding between rival spy agencies not to hound retired intelligence officers . 
Moscow &apos;s view is that the U.S. has violated an unwritten , gentlemanly code of honour in international espionage allowing former agents to travel freely . 
&quot; If Russia did the same to an American ex-spy , the U.S. Sixth Fleet would be here on the Moscow river , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Our counter measures will be very tangible , the whole thing will run like a snowball down the slope , getting bigger all the time . 
she said Russia would wait until Thursday , when Vladimir Galkin will be arraigned for the second time in a federal court in Massachusetts on charges he conspired to steal top secret information about the U.S. &quot; Star Wars &quot; defence programme . 
&quot; We have not yet run out of patience , we still expect common sense to prevail , but we will see what the court says . 
our demands remain the same - his unconditional release and return to Moscow . 
the 50-year-old former spy , who had clearly stated his former profession in his application for a U.S. visa , was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) on Oct . 29 at John F. Kennedy airport in New York . 
Galkin was ordered returned to jail after the first court hearing on Tuesday . 
Russia &apos;s foreign ministry demanded Galkin &apos;s release earlier this week and labelled the case &quot; a provocation &quot; . 
&quot; There has never been such a case . 
it is a provocation which originated out of nowhere , while the United States gave no reasons for such action , &quot; she said . 
&quot; They ( the FBI ) wanted to show their expertise , but any expert can say that it was a dumb provocation . 
&quot; Galkin is not a criminal , but he was lured into the United States in the same way the Interpol treats criminals , &quot; she said , referring to the fact that the warrant for his arrest was issued before his visa to the United States . 
political analysts have suggested that former senior Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) officers might be legitimate targets for retaliation while on private visits to Russia . 
&quot; The FBI cannot ignore the fact that former U.S. spies working in Russia will face similiar measures , &quot; Samolis said , commenting that the case may reflect differences between the CIA and the FBI . 
&quot; There are more than enough employees of the U.S. secret service , both working and retired , in Russia at the moment , &quot; she told Interfax news agency .
