European jet fuel premiums to gas oil futures were steady on Wednesday . 
traders said second half February barges were well supplied in NWE with premiums holding around the level done yesterday at March IPE + 25.75 fob Rotterdam . 
cargo supplies were a touch tigher with prices pegged around March IPE + $ 30 . 
strong swaps buying at the beginning of the week reflected recent price drops and end-users &apos; desire to lock in at relatively attractive levels . 
in the Mediterranean the market looked long , although interest remains to take material eastwards . 
&quot; It is workable , but getting hold of the right grade and ship is not so easy , &quot; said one trader . 
prices varied between fob high quotes + $ 3 for Libyan up to fob high quotes + $ 8 for EC quality .
