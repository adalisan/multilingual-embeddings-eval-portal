an Israeli military court ruled on Thursday that a soldier who shot and wounded seven Palestinians in Hebron last month be treated in a psychiatric hospital and not jailed for the crime , an army spokeswoman said . 
Noam Friedman , a 22-year-old conscript , told the court he shot into a crowd of Arabs in a Hebron marketplace on New Year &apos;s Day to prevent Israel from handing over most of the town to Palestinian self-rule . 
Friedman also said he wanted to avenge the death of Baruch Goldstein , a Jewish settler who massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers in a Hebron mosque in 1994 . 
Goldstein was beaten to death by survivors . 
the spokeswoman said the military court in Jaffa , ruling in the case , ordered Friedman -- who Israeli newspapers reported had a history of mental disorders -- released from detention and sent to a psychiatric hospital . 
she gave no other details and did not say whether Friedman would be confined to the facility or undergo treatment as an out-patient . 
an Israeli officer overpowered Friedman , a religious Jew and resident of a West Bank Jewish settlement , shortly after he opened fire from his M-16 automatic rifle . 
Israel handed over 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian self-rule on January 17 under a peace deal .
