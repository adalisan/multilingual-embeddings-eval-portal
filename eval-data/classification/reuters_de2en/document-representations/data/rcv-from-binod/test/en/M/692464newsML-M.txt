livestock analysts are looking for sharply higher to limit-up gains in CME lean hog and pork belly futures on Monday following Friday &apos;s USDA quarterly hogs and Pigs report . 
&quot; What we are going to do is see a shift into expansion into the early part of next year rather than into the third and fourth quarter of this year , &quot; said Dale Benson , vice president and senior livestock analyst for Dean Witter . 
hog futures are expected to open up 1.000 to 1.500 cent per lb in July and August and up the 2.000 cent limit in back months . 
pork bellies are seen opening up the 3.000 cent , analysts said . 
cash hog prices are seen holding in the high $ 50s to low $ 60s per cwt this summer based on the report , they added . 
USDA put total U.S. hog numbers on farms as of June 1 at 102 percent of last year . 
this compared with analyst estimates for all hogs and pigs at an average 102.9 percent in a range of 101.7 to 105 percent . 
hogs kept for breeding were put at 101 percent of a year ago , compared with the average estimate of 104.3 percent in a range of 103 to 106 percent . 
hogs kept for market were at 102 percent of a year ago , compared with the average estimate of 102.6 percent in a range of 101 to 105 percent . 
the 101 percent kept-for-breeding number was the biggest surprise in the report . 
the figure , along a rise of only two percent in total hog numbers , should spark active demand for CME hog and pork belly futures on Monday , they said . 
some analysts expressed skepticism that the kept-for-breeding number could be so low while farrowing intentions for the summer and fall were put at 105 and 106 percent respectively . 
&quot; I just think there are a few hundred thousand hogs that were put in one category ( for market ) that should have been put in the other ( for breeding ) , &quot; said Chuck Levitt , senior livestock analyst with Alaron Trading Corp. &quot; As we get into the September report we will find that there will be that adjustment made . 
but analyts said traders have no choice but to go by the USDA &apos;s lower than expected numbers . 
&quot; The trade is going to trade this report , &quot; said Jim Sigmon , vice president of the commodity department at Securities Corportion of Iowa . 
some analysts said the report could affect Japanese pork buying plans . 
Japan has been widely expected to enter the U.S. market in force following a pork export ban in Taiwan , and many analysts thought Japanese buyers were looking to today &apos;s report for an assessment of potential pork supplies . 
&quot; If Japan was waiting for lower prices this fall and they take a look at this report and it becomes evident that we &apos;re not going to have lower prices in the fall , we may force them into coming in early , &quot; said Dave Maher with Securities Corporation of Iowa .
