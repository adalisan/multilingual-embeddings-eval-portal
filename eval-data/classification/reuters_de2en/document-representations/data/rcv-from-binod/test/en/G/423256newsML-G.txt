Costa Rican internationals Paulo Cesar Wanchope and Mauricio Solis have signed for English premier league side Derby County , their agent said . 
striker Wanchope and midfielder Sols both signed three year contracts and expect to be available for their debuts on March 22 , agent Elias Soley said . 
the two are in the national squad for a friendly at home to Cameroon on Sunday . 
they are also expected to be picked for the World Cup match at home to Mexico on March 23 , Costa Rica &apos;s first game in the final stage of the CONCACAF qualifying tournament . 
five Costa Ricans currently play abroad -- three in Mexico , one in Colombia and one in Spain .
