Christchurch , April 9 - Otago highlanders coach Glenn Ross is poised to make several changes to his side to play the Canterbury crusaders in a Super 12 rugby match at Carisbrook on Saturday night , NZPA reports . 
it &apos;s crunch time for bottom-of-the-table highlanders this weekend after four losses from five games this season and several regulars could find themselves sitting on the reserves bench after Ross names his lineup on Thursday . 
apart from an impressive win over Northern Transvaal -- in Otago &apos;s only game at Carisbrook to date -- the highlanders have little to show for the season . 
Ross thought his side had turned a corner against Northern Transvaal but they were quickly brought back to earth with a hiding from Free State Cheetahs at Invercargill the following weekend . 
that result was put down as being just a bad day until they produced another disappointing result last weekend , losing 37-24 to the previously winless Queensland reds . 
it hasn &apos;t been an easy road for the highlanders , who have been without star flanker Josh Kronfeld , who injured his shoulder pre-season . 
Kronfeld was on the mend when he aggravated a thigh injury and is out for another two or three weeks . 
centre Romi Ropati , with concussion , and lock Tewini Hemi , injured ankle , will also miss Saturday &apos;s game . 
Ross said the highlanders must beat the crusaders in the South Island derby to stand any chance of progressing up the ladder . 
&quot; I &apos;m extremely disappointed with the results we have had to date . 
we came back from a difficult two-match tour to South Africa with the feeling that things were coming along well for us , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The Northern Transvaal game confirmed that promise but we may have been misled with the direction we thought we were taking . 
&quot; We stuck with that team for Free State in Invercargill and played quite poorly . 
we gave the boys an opportunity to get it right in the following game , and we had more of the same against Queensland . 
the latest loss rammed home to the highlanders management that they needed to rethink their tactical planning . 
&quot; With that review , we need to look at the selections and that &apos;s what we are considering before naming our team , &quot; said Ross . 
the highlanders &apos; lineout , second phase and scrummaging had been solid but fell away significantly against Free State and Queensland , with too many of their own lineouts being lost in Brisbane . 
it &apos;s just a matter of refocusing and becoming more accurate with the options we take , &quot; said Ross , who added that the highlanders would pay close attention to second-phase play and try and prevent any turnovers in the tackle on Saturday . 
&quot; We want to play the expansive game and we have the outside backs to do it but we have not been able to provide them with the opportunities . 
&quot; With tactical appraisal and review , selection appraisal and review goes hand in hand . 
but I definitely believe we will be improving as the Super 12 reaches its conclusion . 
&quot; We are not making excuses but has been a difficult start to the season for a young side to start with four South African sides , with the first two weeks in South Africa . 
to play the first New Zealand side this week says something . 
Ross conceded there was some substance in the criticism that Otago had made a tour of Britain in January when they would have been better off preparing more appropriately for the Super 12 , but that was certainly not the reason why his side was not performing at the moment . 
meanwhile , the crusaders continue to be dogged by injuries as they look for a replacement for lock Steve Lancaster , who is out for at least three weeks after suffering an injury in last Friday &apos;s loss to the Auckland blues . 
key backs Waisake Sotutu and Tabai Matson are still out injured while the crusaders have problems at prop with Con Barrell still doubtful in the long term with asthma worries and John Akurangi out with a broken arm .
