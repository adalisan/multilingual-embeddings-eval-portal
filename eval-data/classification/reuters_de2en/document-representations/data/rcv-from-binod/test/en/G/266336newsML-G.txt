four other Australian cities will join Sydney in hosting the preliminary round soccer matches of the 2000 Olympics but Sydney will host most subsequent matches and stage the men &apos;s final in its future Olympic stadium . 
international soccer officials were angered that none of the the matches at this year &apos;s Atlanta Games were played in Atlanta itself , even though soccer drew more spectators than any other Olympic event . 
European soccer boss Lennart Johansson , a candidate to head world governing body FIFA , said earlier this month that the sport could even be dropped from the Olympic programme . 
Sydney Olympic officials said on Thursday that Sydney would be the Games &apos; main soccer venue , although Melbourne , Canberra , Brisbane and Adelaide had met the criteria for hosting preliminary matches . 
&quot; This decision is great news for Olympic supporters and soccer fans outside Sydney as it will give them a chance to see one of the leading Olympic sports contested in their home cities , &quot; Australian Olympic chief John Coates said . 
Melbourne &apos;s soccer venue for the Games will be the 52,000-capacity Docklands Stadium , while Canberra will stage matches at Bruce Stadium . 
Brisbane matches will be played at Lang Park and Adelaide &apos;s at Hindmarsh Stadium . 
the 16-team men &apos;s draw and the eight-team women &apos;s competition will be divided into groups of four , with each group based in a city outside Sydney . 
Sydney will stage no preliminary matches apart from the opening match of the tournament . 
the finals , semifinals and most of the quarter-finals will all held in Sydney , Coates said . 
Coates said the men &apos;s final would be staged at the Olympic Stadium , to be built at the main Games site in Homebush Bay . 
other matches would be played at the Sydney Football Stadium . 
soccer Australia chairman David Hill predicted soccer would be the biggest revenue-generator for Sydney Games organisers . 
&quot; soccer has been the biggest crowd-puller , and money-earner , of all sports at recent Games , &quot; Hill said .
