the New York State comptroller faulted Cohoes for incurring a $ 3 million deficit by the end of 1995 and breaking local finance laws by misusing bond funds , the Albany Times Union said in its Wednesday edition . 
H. Carl McCall reported that the $ 3 million deficit was spread over the water , sewer , library , general and special funds . 
around $ 1 million of water and sewer cash shortages were covered out of the general fund , which was not repaid . 
and $ 2.75 million was borrowed through revenue anticipation notes , with cash shifted from capital projects to cover the general fund shortfalls , the paper said . 
it explained this transfer violated the local finance law , as it only allows bond proceeds to be used for the purposes for which the debt is issued . 
while the mayor , Robert Signoracci , told the paper that there would not be a repeat of such criticisms under his Administration , he did not promise to raise property taxes to cover the deficits . 
the paper quoted the mayor as saying that spending would have to be cut and raising property taxes would be his last choice .
