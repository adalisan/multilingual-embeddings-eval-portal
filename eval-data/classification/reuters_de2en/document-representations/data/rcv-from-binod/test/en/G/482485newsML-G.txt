two Tamil Tiger guerrilla boats were damaged in a clash with Sri Lankan navy patrols off the island &apos;s northern coast early on Wednesday , a military statement said . 
it said 12 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) boats were detected moving near Karathivu island , off northern Jaffna peninsula , some 380 km ( 237 miles ) north of the capital Colombo and were engaged by naval patrols . 
the statement said no naval personnel were injured and none of its vessels damaged in the attack , but it gave no details on Tiger casualties or how many navy vessels were involved . 
the navy has stepped up attacks in recent weeks against the LTTE &apos;s naval Sea Tiger wing . 
on Tuesday , the navy sank a rebel boat off the island &apos;s east coast and killed at least five guerrillas . 
the LTTE are fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka &apos;s north and east . 
the government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war , now in its 14th year .
