Brazil &apos;s operational public sector deficit will end the year at 3.5 percent of gross domestic product because of the worse-than-expected finances of the states and lower-than-foreseen revenue , an official said . 
Murilo Portugal , head of the National Treasury , confirmed to reporters the government had raised its operational deficit forecast from an original 2.5 percent of GDP . 
he said the states were contributing to a bleaker fiscal situation because the Treasury was having to loan them money to pay off salary arrears and for advance outlays on voluntary redundancy programmes . 
he added , &quot; ( Tax ) revenue has not evolved as we had hoped in the second half of the year . 
Portugal said revenue , which had been expected to pick up along with the economic recovery , had actually decreased . 
&quot; There has been a decrease which we did not predict , &quot; he said . 
finance Minister Pedro Malan last Friday first confirmed the government had raised its forecast of the 1996 operational deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP , bringing the official view more in line with market estimates . 
at the beginning of the year , the government had pledged to halve last year &apos;s 5.0 percent of GDP operational deficit . 
Portugal , reiterating Malan &apos;s expectation that a cost-cutting and revenue-raising package announced last Friday would improve the fiscal accounts next year , said 1997 should see an operational deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP .
