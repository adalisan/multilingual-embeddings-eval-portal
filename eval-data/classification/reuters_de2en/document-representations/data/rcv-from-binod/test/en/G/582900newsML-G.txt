the Chicago Board Options Exchange said it appointed Amy Zisook , a veteran of Democratic political campaigns including President Bill Clinton &apos;s , as director of civic and governmental affairs . 
Zisook has worked at the White House as a special assistant to President Clinton , serving as a liaison to the business community , the exchange said . 
she also worked on the Clinton for President Campaign and the Democratic National Committee Victory Fund . 
&quot; She is uniquely qualified to develop this newly created position , which will draw upon her governmental experience , both at the state and national levels , &quot; CBOE chairman Bill Brodsky said in a statement . 
Zisook worked on former Illinois Senator Paul Simon &apos;s 1990-re-election and 1988 presidential campaigns and the Chicago Bar Association Capital campaigns , the CBOE said . 
Brodsky , who took over the helm of the exchange in March , said then that a top priority in the early part of his chairmanship was to step up dialogue with Washington regulators , notably on taxation issues .
