an oil painting shows two children against a dreamy landscape , their arms around each other , entitled &quot; Forever yours Mama and Papa &quot; . 
&quot; That probably once hung over the sofa in the sitting room , &quot; said a 70-year old woman , one of many visitors on Wednesday to an exhibition of Jewish art looted by Nazis in World War Two and currently on show in Vienna . 
no-one has claimed the work and it is unlikely any member of the family that owned the painting survived the Holocaust . 
as with the other 8,000 artworks to come under the hammer on October 29 and 30 , not even the owner &apos;s name is known . 
the proceeds , estimated to reach around $ 3.5 million , will be given to Austrian victims of the Holocaust , including non-Jews . 
Communists , gypsies and homosexuals were also rounded up and ferried to Nazi death camps . 
Peter Noever , director of the Vienna Museum for applied Arts where the exhibition is being held , described the collection as &quot; stolen art from stolen lives &quot; . 
&quot; I can &apos;t bear to think how awful it must have been for those who had to give up all they had , &quot; said an art dealer , standing in front of a picture of a young woman lost in her thoughts surrounded by lilacs and roses . 
most of the 19th century paintings which graced Viennese sitting rooms before World War Two , depicted idyllic scenes with titles such as &quot; Family happiness in the countryside &quot; and &quot; deer grazing in the woods &quot; . 
&quot; It is hard to believe that the owners were all murdered , &quot; a woman in her 50s said . 
a retired civil servant was impressed by the extensiveness of the collection , which was stored for over 40 years in a monastery in Mauerbach . 
&quot; It &apos;s interesting to see the kind of objects they collected then , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There you see such a peaceful scene ... but they could not know what would happen , &quot; he said . 
a 78-year old woman and her friend , lured to the exhibition from a nearby Viennese coffee house , were reluctant to speak about Austria &apos;s Nazi past . 
&quot; It was a sad time then , &quot; one said . 
&quot; It &apos;s a shame that so many people supported Hitler , &quot; said her companion . 
all viewers spoken to declined to give their names . 
after Hitler &apos;s German forces occupied Austria in 1938 Jewish households were systematically looted for artworks . 
the valuable pieces were marked as &quot; reserved for the Fuehrer &quot; and destined for a museum in Linz Hitler planned to erect . 
&quot; Here is displayed the legacy of those who were murdered , exiled and forgotten , &quot; said museum director Noever . 
most of the items are well-preserved . 
an entire Meissner porcelain coffee set with colourful dragons survived the war and four decades in storage in the monastery . 
a 15th century painting by Sienese artist Pietro di Francesco degli Orioli , depicting the Madonna and child and valued up to $ 110,000 , is expected to fetch the highest price . 
&quot; We represent those who can no longer be helped , because their lives were taken along with their possessions , &quot; said Paul Grosz , president of the Vienna Jewish community .
