stocks regained nearly half of the past month &apos;s losses , painting smiles on the faces of some Wall Streeters who viewed the rally as a sign that the bull market is getting back on track . 
but some experts say the market is sending false signals and the light at the end of the tunnel may turn out to be a speeding locomotive . 
the market roared up this week , as the Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 320 points in five trading sessions . 
in late trading Friday , the Dow was up 52.98 points at 6,711.58 . 
the last time the index of 30 blue-chip stocks raced at that speed was when it rose 290 points in the two days after the &quot; Black Monday &quot; market crash on Oct . 19 , 1987 , when the Dow dropped 508 points in its biggest one-day loss ever . 
with the gain , the Dow recovered a large chunk of its 700-point plunge from its March 11 record close of 7,085.16 and finish of 6,391.69 on April 11 . 
the sell-off had been spurred by the Federal Reserve &apos;s decision last month to raise interest rates for the first time in more than two years . 
the central bank further rattled investors by hinting that it would raise interest rates again to head off inflation . 
this week &apos;s rally drew a gasping reaction from the investors who sold out their stocks , fearing that the market was being clawed by a bearish mentality after six years of spirited gains . 
but seasoned analysts say it may be too early to celebrate , and they warn that the market is still not out of the woods yet . 
by the end of the week , the big question was still unanswered : who was driving the market higher ? 
it boiled down to two possibilties -- serious long-term buyers or bottom-fishing investors looking for quick profits . 
the risk is that if the rally was strictly being generated by bargain hunters , and there is no follow-through on their buying , then the market could roll back over again , possibly setting the stage for the next sell-off . 
the experts say the market is at a major crossroads , and it comes down to what signals mutual fund managers send to Wall Street . 
they also warned that just because stocks stop going down , that does not necessarily mean they will start going up again . 
over the last several years , fund managers have powered the market &apos;s spectacular ascent , and the experts say the market-makers will now have to convince investors that the downward momentum is finally turning around . 
&quot; So far , only the fund managers who have been very cash-rich have been anxious to get back in the market , &quot; said John Geraghty at North American Equity Services , a consulting firm . 
&quot; But the lack of huge daily trading volumes may be scaring away a lot of other fund managers , signalling that the move up is not convincing , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s all in the hands of the fund managers and how they handle their cash at this stage of the market , &quot; Geraghty said . 
&quot; If they hold back longer from reinvesting , then they will be telling Wall Street that it is dealing with another animal -- a bear instead of a bull . 
on Monday , when the Dow leaped 60 points , the New York Stock Exchange handled 408 million shares -- the smallest turnover of the year . 
activity has been relatively subdued in light of the market &apos;s big gains . 
mutual funds have been the preferred vehicles for investing and their number stands at 7,000 compared with the 2,400 stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the market also will have to deal with recent history . 
stocks have done poorly in the third year that follows two straight years of strong gains . 
in 1995 , stocks soared 33.5 percent and they climbed 26 percent in 1996 . 
another striking scenario is the market &apos;s four-year cycle that is linked to the presidential elections . 
the year prior to the elections , stocks have historically racked up impressive gains and they have lagged in post-election years . 
so far , mutual fund companies have not reported any panic by their customers , though the market &apos;s downdraft has moved many investors to seek protection in conservative areas such as cash and money market funds , at least until the market works off turbulence . 
AMG Data Services reports that cash flows into U.S. stock funds slowed to $ 1.6 billion for the week ended April 16 , compared with $ 4.1 billion for the previous week and $ 5.2 billion at the same time last year . 
AMG President Robert Adler , who monitors the funds &apos; cash , said that investors concentrated on the conservative , big-name growth and income funds and index funds . 
the conservative investments had inflows of $ 1 billion for the week ended April 16 , little changed from the previous week . 
Burt Berry , publisher of the fund tracking newsletter , NoLoad FundX sees little risk of a horor show for stocks . 
&quot; Most people , but particularly the old timers , don &apos;t recognise that the forces that the drive the market today are simply not the same as those that drove the market 20 or 50 years ago , &quot; he said . 
berry said the institutional investment firms are at the wheel , guiding the $ 3 trillion of mutual funds and the 401-K retirement plans , and as a result , the fickle individual investors have become a thing of the past . 
&quot; In the 1929 and 1987 market crashes , Wall Street was dominated by individuals and today it is dominated by institutions and the retirement money is being invested by the mentality of an institution which lessens the chance of a market panic .
