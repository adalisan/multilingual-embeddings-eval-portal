the price of gold slipped to its lowest since October 4 , 1993 at its fixing on Wednesday after heavy selling overnight by the investment funds . 
&quot; It &apos;s chaos , &quot; one dealer said during early dealing in London as the bullion price moved inexorably under previously established trading ranges . 
the fixing at $ 352.45 per ounce , down from $ 357.40 on Tuesday , extended a decline in value since the beginning of the year to over $ 15 , or four percent of its January 2 fixing of $ 367.80 . 
&quot; It is aiming to go south and the longer the market waits for a short covering rally , the more modest it will be , &quot; said markets analyst Ted Arnold at Merrill Lynch . 
part of the reason for the new weakness in price was the announcement on Monday that the Dutch central bank had sold 300 tonnes of gold from its reserves . 
&quot; The fear of a copy-cat sale has overwhelmed any feeling of relief , &quot; said precious metals analyst Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland . 
selling in New York and the Hong Kong markets overnight was sparked by the U.S. dollar climbing to a 30-month high against the mark , a modest increase in U.S. inflation and continuingly strong equity markets . 
&quot; There is no reason for the gold market to rally just now , &quot; one dealer said , emphasising the strength and profit potential of paper asset markets such as equities and bonds . 
ironically , a statement on Monday from Hans Tietmeyer , chairman of the central bank governors of the so-called G10 group of leading economies , that the group &apos;s central banks did not plan to sell gold for the time failed to calm nerves . 
&quot; Nobody in the market is interpreting literally what a central bank says any more , &quot; one analyst said . 
the prospect of central banks selling has been looming over the gold market for several months . 
a poll by Reuters of 13 analysts on January 9 and January 13 on their views for the spot gold price at the end of January and at the end of the first quarter showed most had lower end-quarter forecasts from those made in a similar poll in mid-December . 
the $ 350 area should provide some psychological support for the time being . 
but over time , prices were likely to target $ 330 , the approximate lows from 1993 , said technical analyst Elli Gifford at Investment Research of Cambridge .. 
the other precious metals were also lower . 
silver was at $ 4.65 / $ 4.67 down five cents , platinum was down $ 5.00 at $ 357.50 / $ 358.50 and palladium was down $ 2.00 at $ 119.50 / $ 120.50 .
