with just 100 days before China regains its coveted prize of Hong Kong , Beijing has sidestepped the colony &apos;s departing British masters and made sure new local leaders know where to take their cue . 
China has made clear its intention to mould the territory &apos;s politics more in its own image , mapping plans to dismantle the elected legislature and water down civil liberties laws while telling Britain that objections were pointless . 
&quot; China is firmly in charge , &quot; said a Beijing-based diplomat . 
Chinese Premier Li Peng has brushed aside London &apos;s hopes of monitoring the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong after the handover , proclaiming that Beijing would implement the accord as it saw fit . 
&quot; I think this is unrealistic , &quot; Li said when asked about British plans to review the pact &apos;s implementation after the transfer of power . 
&quot; After July 1 , Hong Kong &apos;s sovereignty returns to China . 
under the 1984 accord , China has pledged to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover . 
Beijing has also ensured that the future administrators of the territory are firmly in its camp . 
since his selection by a group of 400 people vetted by Beijing , Hong Kong &apos;s leader-in-waiting Tung Chee-hwa has shown little enthusiasm for staking out positions differing from China &apos;s official party line . 
the shipping tycoon-turned-politician , who has shuttled between Hong Kong and Beijing since he was named chief executive-designate last December , has echoed China &apos;s views on issues ranging from the territory &apos;s future legislature to civil liberties and textbook revisions . 
he has also hurled barbs at Hong Kong democratic activists who have been critical of China . 
Beijing has responded by showing its pleasure . 
the official media have described Tung in a somewhat more flattering fashion than that reserved for the territory &apos;s current and last colonial governor , Chris Patten , who has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over his efforts to expand democratic institutions in the final years of British rule . 
in a sign of official favour , cameras of China &apos;s national television lingered on Tung when he attended funeral rites last month for late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping , the man credited with directing the strategy that enabled Beijing to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong . 
&quot; Mr Tung knows that if he doesn &apos;t carry out Beijing &apos;s wishes , someone else will , &quot; said a Western diplomat in Beijing . 
other analysts in Beijing are willing to wait before making a judgment on Tung . 
&quot; He has to establish his credibility with the Chinese , &quot; said a foreign diplomat in Beijing who follows Hong Kong affairs . 
&quot; The question is , will he stand up for Hong Kong &apos;s interests in the future ? 
some people are not so sure . 
&quot; That is the charitable assessment , &quot; said one foreign diplomat in Hong Kong . 
he and other analysts suggest that Tung may be more like many of Hong Kong &apos;s business leaders who are often reluctant to confront Beijing in public , whatever the issue . 
the analysts note opposition can be costly . 
Jardine Matheson , one of the colony &apos;s oldest trading houses , was publicly vilified by Beijing after its directors supported political reforms proposed by Patten . 
it has since worked hard to mend its relationship . 
businessman Jimmy Lai printed vitriolic comments about China &apos;s premier in his Next magazine in 1994 . 
Lai &apos;s Giordano clothing outlets ran into problems with authorities in China and he eventually sold his share in the firm . 
many businessmen would probably prefer to see their names linked to more soothing comments to Beijing &apos;s ears , such as those of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing , on the contribution of China &apos;s late leader Deng Xiaoping . 
an article by Li that was published prominently in the Communist Party newspaper , the People &apos;s Daily , praised the late party patriarch , his chosen successor and the future system for Hong Kong , all making deft use of communist jargon . 
but diplomats said that for political leaders such as Tung , there is a considerable risk in being perceived as too willing to speak out on behalf of Beijing . 
China wants a popular leader who can rally the territory &apos;s 6.4 million people to Beijing &apos;s cause , they said . 
if its interests clash with those of Hong Kong , and Tung is perceived merely as Beijing &apos;s willing tool , the future leader risks losing his still high popular support . 
&quot; China chose him because he was acceptable to many people and would do its bidding , &quot; said a diplomat . 
&quot; If he loses popularity in Hong Kong , that complicates matters for Beijing .
