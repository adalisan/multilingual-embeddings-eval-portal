Charles Trie , one of the businessmen whose contributions to President Clinton were given back by the Democratic Party , was traveling the world and had no intention of returning to the United States soon , the New York Daily News reported Friday . 
in an interview from Hong Kong , the newspaper quoted Trie as saying he defended his fund-raising activities and praised his friend Clinton as &quot; a good man &quot; who &quot; had not done anything wrong . 
Trie has been subpoenaed by at least two congressional panels to appear before them and produce documents about his fund-raising activities for Clinton . 
&quot; I don &apos;t care anymore , &quot; said Trie , a one-time restaurant owner in Little Rock who became an international consultant and delivered $ 640,000 to a legal defense fund set up to help the Clintons pay legal bills . 
I have to work , &quot; Trie said in the Daily News interview . 
&quot; Who is helping me ? 
nobody . 
Taiwan-born Trie , a naturalized U.S. citizen , owned a restaurant in Little Rock , Arkansas , which Clinton frequented when he was governor . 
officials investigating the Democratic National Committee &apos;s fund-raising for the 1996 election campaign have suggested that money raised by Trie , 48 , could have come from the Chinese government to influence Congress . 
among the people taken to the White House by Trie for a reception in February 1996 was Wang Jun , a weapons dealer in China whose company was implicated in an alleged scheme to smuggle guns into United States .
