the U.S. attacks on Iraq have left Gulf Arab states trying to balance support for their powerful guardian against the desire to preserve the sovereignty of a fellow Arab country , diplomats said on Monday . 
the chairman of a two-day meeting of Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) foreign ministers said Saudi Arabia , Oman , Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain and United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) differed with the United States over the strikes and were discussing the issue with Washington . 
&quot; There are no disagreements but there are differences in opinion , &quot; Oman &apos;s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah said after the meeting ended on Sunday . 
the meeting made no formal mention of the barrage of 44 U.S. cruise missiles at southern Iraq last week . 
the chairman said the group felt &quot; there was no need &quot; to mention the attacks in their statement . 
diplomats said this signalled differences within the GCC itself and a fear of souring ties with the country they consider a protector since Baghdad &apos;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
&quot; I think the differences in opinion must have been so strong that that is why they did not say anything ( about the U.S. strikes ) , &quot; said a diplomat . 
&quot; The fact they did not make any comment reflects partly the desire for GCC unity and partly the desire to maintain good relations with the U.S. and other Western allies , &quot; the Western diplomat in Abu Dhabi said . 
the United States said the missiles were a response to Iraqi military intervention in northern Iraq to help a Kurdish faction fighting a rival Kurdish group . 
but much of the Arab world condemned the attacks as infringing Iraq &apos;s sovereignty . 
many Gulf states considered the strikes unjustified as Iraq was acting internally and not threatening neighbours , diplomats said , although some states think any potential threaten by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must be dealt with decisively . 
the GCC was part of the U.S.-led coalition that ended Iraq &apos;s 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait . 
Kuwait said it fully understood the U.S. action . 
with memories of the Iraqi invasion still vivid , the GCC could not denounce the attacks and harm ties with the United States , which many Gulf States consider the only power capable of defending them from Iraq and non-Arab Iran , diplomats said . 
&quot; The statement was very carefully balanced . 
the GCC will continue to depend on the U.S. for military cooperation . 
the U.S. is a superpower , they can &apos;t oppose the U.S. , &quot; said one . 
there are some 20,000 U.S. troops and 300 warplanes deployed in and around the Gulf , with some forces in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait . 
but the GCC also does not want Iraq too weak to serve as a regional counterweight to Iran , diplomats said . 
the group &apos;s statement stressed the need to preserve Iraqi independence , sovereignty and territorial unity . 
&quot; The Gulf states , especially the UAE , don &apos;t want to see the disintegration of Iraq because they need Iraq to counter Iran . 
they fear Iran , &quot; a Western diplomat in Abu Dhabi said . 
since the Gulf War , some Gulf Arab states have adopted a softer line on Iraq . 
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia refuse any direct contact with the Iraqi leader , but Qatar and Oman both have resident Iraqi ambassadors . 
last year , UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan said the time had come to reconcile with Baghdad , urging United Nations sanctions be lifted to ease the Iraqis &apos; suffering . 
one diplomat said the United States was sensitive to GCC opinion and would be relieved by the careful foreign ministers &apos; statement . 
&quot; The U.S. considers this area a very important market for its military industry , and also obviously wants to ensure the smooth flow of oil . 
they ( the U.S. and the GCC ) are mutually dependent on each other , &quot; he said .
