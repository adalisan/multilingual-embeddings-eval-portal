fast Bowler Anthony Stuart claimed a hat-trick as Australia salvaged some pride with a thrilling three-wicket victory over Pakistan in their World Series limited overs match on Thursday . 
Stuart , playing in only his third one-day match for his country , dismissed Ijaz Ahmed , Mohammad Wasim and wicketkeeper Moin Khan in successive balls as part of a five-wicket haul . 
chasing Pakistan &apos;s total of 181 for nine in 50 overs , left-hander Michael Bevan helped steer Australia to 182 for seven with three balls to spare , ending a run of five straight losses in the triangular competition . 
Bevan scored an unbeaten and highly controlled 79 from 142 balls to ensure that Stuart &apos;s outstanding figures of five for 26 from 10 overs were not wasted . 
the lanky New South Wales paceman became only the second Australian Bowler -- and the 12th in the world -- to take a hat-trick in a limited overs international . 
but the victory came too late for Australia , who failed to qualify for the final as hosts in their worst performance in one-day cricket at home for 17 years in terms of results . 
Pakistan and West Indies will face each other in the best-of-three final , starting in Sydney on Saturday . 
given his outstanding innings , it was fitting that Bevan should be responsible for the winning run , even if it came as a leg bye off his pads . 
man of the match Stuart , playing in only his third one-day match for his country , took the first five wickets to fall in the space of 14 deliveries at a miserly cost of just one run in a devastating early burst . 
in his sixth over with the new ball , he lured Ijaz and Wasim to edge faint catches to wicketkeeper Ian Healy before Moin deflected a thicker edge to Australia captain Mark Taylor at first slip . 
opener Inzamam-ul-Haq smashed five fours on his way to a hard-hitting 64 to bolster Pakistan &apos;s total after they slumped to 29 for five . 
Stuart &apos;s hat-trick was the first by an Australian in a one-day international since fast Bowler Bruce Reid in Sydney in January 1986 .
