Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought on Tuesday to avert a split in his coalition over settlement policy in Jerusalem and on a separate front underwent police questioning on alleged government corruption . 
Netanyahu , fresh from a meeting with President Bill Clinton in Washington , forbade a ministerial committee on Jerusalem from discussing a controversial project to build on a forested hill between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in the West Bank . 
asked what would happen if Netanyahu cancelled the Har Homa project , Jewish settler leader Pinchas Wallerstein told Israel Radio : &quot; Then there will be no coalition &quot; . 
facing another potential threat to his government , Netanyahu submitted to police questioning over allegations a short-lived appointment of an Attorney-General last month was part of a deal with a politician already on trial on corruption charges . 
police are probing Israel Television allegations that religious Shas party leader Aryeh Deri had demanded Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On be named Attorney-General in exchange for Shas &apos; support of the Netanyahu &apos;s Hebron deal with the PLO . 
the television also said Bar-On promised Deri a plea-bargain that would have let him continue his political career . 
Bar-On quit on the same day he took office amid allegations by jurists and politicians he was a judicial lightweight . 
Israeli troops pulled out of most of Hebron last month . 
Netanyahu , Bar-On and Deri have denied any wrongdoing . 
&quot; The investigation has reached the stage that requires taking testimony from the prime minister , &quot; Sando Mazor , head of the national police investigative division , told reporters . 
&quot; The prime minister insisted the questioning take place and I have no doubt he will cooperate with us , &quot; Mazor said . 
earlier , Netanyahu postponed debate on Har Homa for at least a week , officials said . 
Ministers instead agreed to speed building of roads in and around Arab East Jerusalem . 
critics of the project said it would spark Palestinian rage that could prove more costly than gunbattles that killed 61 Arabs and 15 Israeli soldiers last year after Netanyahu opened a new entrance to a tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem . 
&quot; We are talking about a &apos; tunnel &apos; that will be longer , darker and more dangerous , &quot; Yossi Sarid , a leader of the left-wing Meretz party , said about the Har Homa plan . 
Netanyahu denied on Tuesday having pledged to freeze the project in talks at the White House last week . 
however , he refrained from stating when a decision might be taken . 
participants in the ministerial meeting quoted Shin Bet secret police chief Ami Ayalon as cautioning the ministers : 
&quot; Even if the Palestinian leader ( Yasser Arafat ) is not interested in violence at this point , the sensitivity of Jerusalem could cause the situation to get out of his control . 
the Palestinian official responsible for Jerusalem , Faisal Husseini , said on Tuesday that if Netanyahu approved the plans to build 6,500 homes at Har Homa , known to Arabs as Jebel Abu Ghneim , the PLO would view it as a &quot; decision of war &quot; . 
angered by media reports Netanyahu promised Clinton to shelve the plan , Israeli hawks said the project was a do or die test for the government . 
Netanyahu &apos;s aides have said he will eventually give the green light to the project . 
cabinet minister Natan Sharansky , who has conditioned his support for the government on approval of Har Homa , rejected suggestions the decision be put off at least until after March 7 , when Israel is due to carry out the first of three troop withdrawals in rural West Bank areas . 
the National Religious Party , a driving force behind settlement , also threatened coalition unity . 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Monday he would consider tough measures against Israel if it continued to expand settlement in Jerusalem , whose Israeli-captured eastern half he wants as the capital of a Palestinian state .
