Turkish bond rates rose and Istanbul stocks remained volatile on Friday amid mounting speculation the Islamist-led government would collapse soon under pressure from the secularist armed forces , bankers said . 
some bankers say any possibility of early elections might trigger further rate hikes in financial markets which have remained stable so far despite rate fluctuations . 
bond rates rose about two percentage points to 99 percent after a four percent increase on Thursday . 
stocks were up slightly but many investors kept to the sidelines amid conflicting political signals . 
&quot; Bonds rates have reached their peak , reflecting the recent political developments . 
for a further rise , there must be a possibility of early elections this year , &quot; said the treasurer of an Istanbul-based private bank . 
Ali Ozenc , treasurer of private Finansbank , said an early election or a military intervention would be the most negative outcome of the ongoing political crisis for financial markets . 
&quot; The collapse of the government or the establishment of a new one do not distort the financial stability ... The worst of all will be an early election or a military rule , &quot; Ozenc said . 
the IMKB National-100 which dived 4.9 percent on Thursday over fears the coalition government may collapse , closed Friday &apos;s morning session 0.21 percent lower at 1,454 . 
they later rebounded slightly in afternoon trade . 
the lira remained unchanged at 134,050 against the dollar thanks to the central bank &apos;s Thursday intervention which bankers said had weakened the demand for the U.S. currency . 
brokers say some reaction buys after Thursday &apos;s sharp decline eased the downtrend , adding that the mood is still cautious ahead of a key National Security Council ( NSC ) meeting on Saturday . 
&quot; ( Prime Minister Necmettin ) Erbakan &apos;s delaying tactics keeps the market waiting . 
but in the end , it must be accepted that the coalition government is in a tight corner , &quot; said Tuncay Kuzu from Sahin securities . 
daily Yeni Yuzyil on Friday quoted unnamed cabinet ministers as saying Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller had decided to pull her conservative True Path Party ( DYP ) out of the 10-month-old Islamist-led coalition . 
Ciller later denied the report . 
&quot; Don &apos;t believe things about withdrawing from the government that you haven &apos;t heard from me , &quot; she told reporters . 
some brokers say Ciller &apos;s remarks might help stock prices recover part of its two-day losses in the afternoon trading , but the underlying mood would continue to be jittery unless the political upheavel settles and the NSC meeting produces a reconciliation . 
&quot; The results of tomorrow &apos;s NSC meeting will set the market direction next week , &quot; Kuzu of Sahin Securities said . 
the military members of the NSC are expected to increase demands on the reluctant government to implement anti-Islamist measures introduced by the generals at a February meeting . 
the government has taken no concrete steps to comply with the army &apos;s demands , which include restrictions on religious education , and strict enforcement of bans on Islamic dress .
