Fife Symington said Tuesday that when Symington was a real estate developer , he gave different lenders conflicting statements of his financial condition . 
Joyce Reibel , who was Symington &apos;s secretary for 12 years , opened the federal government &apos;s case against the Republican governor by testifying that she provided many lenders with differing financial statements for more than a decade , beginning in the early 1980s . 
under questioning from assistant U.S. Attorney David Schindler , Reibel described how she kept track of the various statements coming out of Symington &apos;s development office and kept that information under lock and key . 
Symington , a two-term governor , faces 22 felony charges including financial fraud , attempted extortion and perjury . 
if convicted on a single count , he would be removed from office . 
he faces prison if found guilty on any of the charges . 
Reibel outlined how she would carefully update financial statements after getting revised figures from Symington about his worth , particularly his vast real estate holdings . 
in meticulous fashion , prosecutors had her go through a series of documents to show apparent conflicts in the information provided to such lenders as First Interstate Bank of Arizona , Valley National Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd . 
on several occasions , Reibel had to have her memory refreshed with testimony she gave in January 1994 before a federal grand jury . 
she testified there for three days . 
her testimony , which will continue Wednesday , is considered the backbone of the government &apos;s case against the 51-year-old descendent of industrialist Henry clay Frick . 
prosecutors hope her testimony will help them support their claims that Symington submitted &quot; blatantly false &quot; financial statements to prevent his real estate empire from collapsing . 
the government will also try to prove that Symington used extortion to try to get six union pension funds to release him from a personal guarantee he gave to obtain $ 10 million for a downtown Phoenix shopping center . 
in addition , Symington is fighting a charge that he lied under oath during court proceedings in his bankruptcy case . 
he filed for Chapter 7 liquidation of assets in September 1995 . 
Defense attorney John Dowd has acknowledged that mistakes were made but has said they were unintentional and did not affect lenders &apos; decisions . 
he has also attempted to shift blame to Coopers &amp; Lybrand , the accounting firm that worked on Symington &apos;s books . 
the trial is expected to take 12 weeks .
