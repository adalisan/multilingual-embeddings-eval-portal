Bangladesh &apos;s former military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad , his career threatened by a love affair , told followers on Wednesday that politics was his first love . 
a leader of Ershad &apos;s Jatiya party quoted the 68-year-old former strongman as saying : &quot; Politics is my priority and my first love , too . 
&quot; The chairman ( Ershad ) assured us that he would do nothing that harms the party and makes his political future uncertain , &quot; said the leader , who declined to be identified . 
Lieutenant-General Ershad , who seized power in 1982 , was deposed in 1990 and jailed . 
he was freed in January , but stirred controversy when he celebrated his birthday recently with his lover of 14 years , member of parliament Zinat Hossain , instead of his wife . 
close associates in the Jatiya Party objected to such behaviour and three Jatiya leaders told newspapers on Wednesday they might break with Ershad and even split the party . 
his wife of more than 40 years , Begum Roushan and also a legislator , briefly left Ershad to live with her sister . 
Ershad , with help of several Jatiya leaders , persuaded Roushan to return home , but the rift has widened . 
some party colleagues and relatives are demanding an end to the ex-president &apos;s affair . 
however , despite Ershad &apos;s assurances that he will not allow his personal life to interfere with politics , he is reported to be still deeply involved with Zinat . 
&quot; He will not listen to us , he is just crazy about that woman , &quot; one Jatiya leader said . 
Ershad told the Sangbad newspaper : &quot; My relationship with Zinat has been a 14-year affair . 
she has done a lot for me ... I want to make a decision about her . 
&quot; My problem is now is one lady ( Zinat ) , I feel very weak at this . 
&quot; I have made my proposal ( of marriage ) to Zinat and am awaiting her reply , &quot; he added . 
newspapers on Wednesday said Zinat , who is in her late forties , had told Ershad he must divorce Roushan before they can wed . 
Jatiya sources said on Wednesday night they expected Ershad to &quot; convince Zinat that a formal wedding could wait when romance continues to bloom &quot; . 
one political source said he believed that political realities would eventually prevail over love . 
&quot; We believe Ershad is clever enough not to ruin his career , &quot; the source said .
