Israel &apos;s Benjamin Netanyahu struggled on Monday to avert a setback in parliament , trying to placate political allies who accused him of breaking promises and mismanaging his government . 
little more than a year into office , the 47-year-old prime minister came under pressure from coalition members demanding help for constituents and control of ministries he was due to dish out in a cabinet reshuffle . 
by all accounts Netanyahu would defeat no-confidence votes scheduled for Tuesday in the 120-seat Knesset and brought by opposition parties critical of his administration . 
it remained to be seen however how many of the coalition members who make up Netanyahu &apos;s 66-54 majority would embarrass him and abstain as an expression of their disaffection . 
&quot; Regrettably , we are talking about a huge number of personal and selfish interests , &quot; said Michael Eitan , the member of parliament from Netanyahu &apos;s rightist Likud party who acts as chief of the coalition faction . 
it was even unclear who would defend the government in parliament since the woman assigned to the job , Communications Minister Limor Livnat , angrily resigned on Saturday as coordinator between the government and parliament . 
speaking to reporters Netanyahu voiced confidence his opponents would fall short of the 61 votes required to force new elections for both prime minister and parliament . 
&quot; We have a government which will continue . 
the coalition is stable . 
there are problems -- they &apos;ll be solved , &quot; he said . 
Netanyahu &apos;s spokesman said the Israeli leader still intended to put his new ministerial appointments to votes in cabinet and parliament also on Tuesday . 
ex-general Ariel Sharon was frontrunner for the senior job of finance minister vacated by Netanyahu &apos;s Likud party rival Dan Meridor last week in a power struggle over the economy . 
two of Netanyahu &apos;s cabinet ministers have quit . 
two other ministers boycotted a cabinet meeting on Friday . 
there &apos;s dissension in the ranks . 
Netanyahu &apos;s judgment has come into question on issues ranging from Jewish settlement expansion which has plunged Middle East peacemaking into crisis to a political appointment which nearly got him indicted earlier this year . 
Israeli political analysts cite Netanyahu &apos;s inexperience and massive ambition as possible explanations . 
&quot; The only solution is early elections , &quot; insisted David Magen , a member of parliament from the Likud-aligned Gesher faction who quit as Netanyahu &apos;s deputy finance minister . 
&quot; We &apos;ll continue our discussion and adopt a stance , &quot; Foreign Minister David Levy , head of Gesher , told Israel Radio . 
the biggest threat to Netanyahu &apos;s government appeared to come from a party of Russian immigrants led by Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky which demands say over the next ambassador to Moscow and aid for constituents . 
&quot; As long as we don &apos;t get real answers , we won &apos;t be able to vote for the prime minister , &quot; said Roman Bronfman , leader of Sharansky &apos;s seven-member Yisrael ba-Aliya faction in parliament . 
but Shimon Shiffer , diplomatic correspondent of Israel &apos;s biggest newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth , said there was no way 61 members of parliament would come out against Netanyahu . 
&quot; Basically the members of his coalition feel very good that they are now running the country and have all these budgets . 
no one really seriously wants to go to a new election , &quot; he said . 
Sharon &apos;s expected appointment has stirred controversy with critics fearing he would exploit the job to expand Jewish settlement viewed by Washington as an obstacle to peace . 
it would be Sharon &apos;s most senior cabinet post since a 1982 Beirut massacre of Palestinians by Israel &apos;s Christian militia allies forced him out as defence minister in 1983 .
