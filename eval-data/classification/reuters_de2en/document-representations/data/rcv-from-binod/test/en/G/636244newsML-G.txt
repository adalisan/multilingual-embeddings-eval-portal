Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien voiced satisfaction on Wednesday with the decline in the Quebec separatist vote in Monday &apos;s federal election . 
&quot; There was a very serious decline in the vote of the Bloc Quebecois in Quebec , despite what they say . 
it is the lowest score by any separatist party in Quebec since 1973 , and that is very significant , &quot; Chretien told a news conference . 
the Bloc Quebecois , dedicated to winning independenc for Quebec , was bumped from the position of official opposition in the Canadian Parliament by the Reform Party . 
the Bloc won 44 seats , 10 fewer than in 1993 , and its share of the vote in the province shrank to 38 percent from 49 percent . 
separatists scored 49.4 percent in a 1995 referendum on whether Quebec should become sovereign after making an offer of partnership to Canada , but polls during the 1997 election campaign also showed decline in support on that question . 
a Reuters poll , taken by Zogby International in the middle of the campaign , showed only 42.1 percent saying they would vote yes if the 1995 referendum question were asked today , with 57.9 percent opposed . 
for much of his mandate , Chretien had to face separatist firebrand Lucien Bouchard , now Quebec premier , across the aisle in the House of Commons . 
&quot; When I read in the press and I look at the good old days when Lucien Bouchard was leader of the opposition , for me it was not the good old days , &quot; Chretien said . 
he pointedly praised the Conservative and New Democratic parties for their position on national unity . 
&quot; Now that we have two parties with national outlooks with seats in the House of Commons , that is very positive , &quot; he said . 
Chretien added that the separatists running the Quebec government &quot; should look at the reality of the meaning of that vote for them . 
Chretien asserted that to try to rescue a flagging Bloc campaign , separatists went all out in the final 10 days . 
&quot; They said that is the equivalent of a quasi-referendum , and they started talking about having more than 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats , &quot; Chretien declared . 
some of the Bloc vote went to the Conservative Party , which under former prime minister Brian Mulroney had gone to great lengths to accommodate Quebec demands .
