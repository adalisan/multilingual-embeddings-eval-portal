polls closed on Sunday in three states in Mexico where key local elections are expected to give a clearer picture of whether President Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) can keep its long grip on power . 
polls closed at 6 p.m. ( 2400 GMT ) in the states of Mexico , Hidalgo and Coahuila , and observers said that while turnout was generally low , there were only scattered reports of irregularities . 
an election watchdog group , Civic Alliance , said it found several small irregularities , such as party supporters trying to shift people &apos;s opinions at the voting booths , which is not permitted . 
the group &apos;s co-ordinator , Leonardo Acevevo Esquival , told Reuters that participation was low , probably less than 50 percent , as many voters doubted the credibility of elections . 
results were due to start trickling in late on Sunday night , with a clear tendency in voting likely to be established by dawn on Monday . 
reports on Radio Red also spoke of low turnout and at least one example of party supporters clashing at a polling station . 
the pri has ruled Mexico &apos;s federal government without a break for 67 years and until recently opposition parties barely had any representation at all in town halls , state governorships or Congress . 
of the three states voting on Sunday , the most important was the state of Mexico , the heartland of the old Aztec empire , which straggles around Mexico City to the north , east and west . 
home to 11.7 million people , the state is the country &apos;s most populous and home to much of its industry . 
opinion polls suggested a tight , three-way fight for Mexico state &apos;s top five municipalities among the pri and its two main rivals , the conservative National Action Party ( PAN ) and the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) . 
Naucalpan , which is part of the sprawl of greater Mexico City , is the state &apos;s third biggest municipality and the PAN had high hopes of capturing it . 
all three parties were treating the elections as a dry run for key midterm congressional votes next July -- a date which will also see the first-ever election of a mayor of Mexico City . 
hitherto the post was held by presidential appointees . 
Sunday &apos;s elections , which also included the northern state of Coahuila bordering Texas and the poor central state of Hidalgo , provided a test of President Zedillo &apos;s commitment to cleaning up Mexico &apos;s historically dubious electoral record . 
to prevent fraud , voters were to use a electoral photo-ID card , which officials at the polling station would check against a voter list printed on security paper that includes a photo of every citizen registered .
