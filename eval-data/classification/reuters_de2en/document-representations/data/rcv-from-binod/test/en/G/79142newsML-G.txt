an Indian court on Thursday rejected a request by former prime minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao for legal protection against arrest in a criminal conspiracy case , court officials said . 
the Delhi High court denied Rao &apos;s request for anticipatory bail in the $ 100,000 case , they said . 
anticipatory bail protects an accused against arrest . 
&quot; The application for anticipatory bail is dismissed , &quot; judge S.K. 
Mahajan said . 
&quot; The application is not maintainable . 
Rao &apos;s lawyer had asked on Wednesday for anticipatory bail before a hearing next Monday in the cheating case . 
Rao resigned as president of the Congress party on Saturday after a judge ordered him to appear in court as a co-accused at Monday &apos;s hearing . 
Indian expatriate businessman Lakhubhai Pathak alleges that Rao and a Hindu guru conspired to cheat him of $ 100,000 in 1983 . 
Pathak says he paid the money to guru Chandraswami in a failed attempt to secure a state newsprint contract after Rao , then foreign minister , assured him at a meeting in a New York hotel that his &quot; work would be done &quot; . 
Rao has said he is innocent and has denied he was in New York on the dates mentioned by Pathak . 
the two other accused , Chandraswami and his personal assistant , are currently in judicial custody in Tihar jail , Asia &apos;s biggest prison , in the Indian capital . 
judicial custody is ordered by authorities during an investigation and ahead of a trial . 
authorities said that at Monday &apos;s hearing , the court was expected to frame formal charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating against Rao . 
the charges carry a maximum penalty of seven years in jail . 
when Rao resigned as head of Congress , India &apos;s oldest party , he had already been under pressure to quit after leading Congress to its worst defeat in general elections that ended in May . 
Congress has ruled India for all but four years since independence from Britain in 1947 . 
although a former prime minister and current member of parliament , Rao has no immunity in the case . 
Rao &apos;s counsel argued in a petition presented to the court on Wednesday that his client was concerned he might be arrested because the two other accused were in jail . 
before the judge handed down his ruling on Thursday , court sources said if Rao was denied anticipatory bail , he could be be arrested on Monday . 
he could then apply for regular bail , the sources said . 
the Times of India newspaper said the government was drawing up a contingency plan for offering medical assistance to Rao if he is sent to jail . 
Rao has a history of heart trouble . 
Rao was replaced on Monday as Congress chief by Sitaram Kesri , 80 , a veteran party leader who swiftly reaffirmed his group &apos;s crucial support for Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda &apos;s centre-left coalition . 
Kesri will serve as interim party president pending the election of a new chief by the All India Congress Committee , the powerful plenary of the party , which is expected to meet next month . 
newspapers quoted some legal experts as saying Rao should receive the same treatment as the two other accused who are in judicial custody . 
others said Rao &apos;s alleged role was not the same as theirs , and he deserved different treatment as a former prime minister . 
the case is one of several involving Congress members which have tarnished the party &apos;s image .
