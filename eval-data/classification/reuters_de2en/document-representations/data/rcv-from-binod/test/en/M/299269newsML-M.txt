grain and soybean prices soared Friday after the Department of Agriculture cut its final estimates for 1996 crops and stockpiles and reported the lowest winter wheat plantings since 1978 . 
oil prices fell sharply on talk of increased gasoline suppliers and following a fall in spot prices at the U.S. Gulf . 
the Knight Ridder commodity Research Bureau index of 17 futures ended up 0.24 point at 241.95 . 
at the Chicago Board of Trade , soybeans led the grain markets higher , with March soybeans closing up the allowable daily limit of 30 cents a bushel at $ 7.29-1 / 4 following the Agriculture Department report . 
March corn rose the 12-cent limit in early trading and closed at $ 2.65-1 / 2 , up 7-1 / 4 cents . 
&quot; It &apos;s very obvious the trade was caught by surprise , particularly on the bean side , &quot; said Mark Cermak , trading specialist for Chicago-based trade house O &apos;Connor and Co . 
&quot; All we need is any indication of weather problems in South America and this market is potentially explosive , much beyond anything we &apos;ve seen prior to today , &quot; Cermak said . 
the Agriculture Department put final 1996 U.S. soybean production at 2.382 billion bushels , below average expectations for 2.407 billion . 
it also estimated U.S. soybean stocks as of next Sept . 1 at 155 million bushels , down from 180 million last month . 
&quot; Securing bean supplies over the next few months will be difficult , &quot; said John Zanutto , senior vice president at LFG futures . 
the Agriculture Department also pegged 1996 U.S. corn production at 9.293 billion bushels , up 28 million bushels from last month but below average trade expectations of 9.317 billion . 
corn stocks as of next Sept . 1 were trimmed to 959 million bushels from the previous 1.157 billion bushels . 
&quot; larger feed and residual use more than offset the larger production , &quot; the Agriculture Department said in cutting the end-stocks figure . 
U.S. farmers also seeded 48.2 million acres of winter wheat last fall for harvest , the lowest plantings since 1978 and sharply below average expectations for 51.4 million acres . 
&quot; The second biggest surprise in the report was the wheat acreage number . 
that &apos;s a tremendous drop , the 3 million acres , &quot; said Paul Haugens , vice president at Fimat futures . 
new crop Chicago Board of Trade wheat contracts reflected the low plantings , with July 1997 futures closing up 8-1 / 2 cents a bushel at $ 3.54-1 / 4 . 
but March wheat ended at $ 3.87 , down 2-1 / 4 cents as traders focused on the current slow pace of exports . 
ray Halley , chief of the Agriculture Department &apos;s crop branch in Washington , said low U.S. winter wheat seedings could prompt more plantings later this year of spring wheat . 
&quot; This is just winter wheat seedings ... a lot of times when you see low winter wheat , you see more spring wheat plantings to fill in the void , &quot; Halley told reporters . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange , oil prices ended lower as increasing gasoline supplies and easing cash prices in the Gulf of Mexico weighed on crude oil . 
February crude oil closed 28 cents a barrel lower at $ 26.09 . 
February unleaded gasoline closed down 0.12 cent a gallon at 70.36 cents , and February heating oil down 0.90 cent at 72.15 cents a gallon . 
gasoline prices eased on talk by European traders that as many as 25 tankers have been scheduled over the last week to carry about 8.5 million barrels to New York Harbour , where supplies were already deemed sufficient . 
heating oil prices followed Gulf of Mexico cash prices lower despite forecasts of below normal temperatures next week in the Northeast , the major U.S. heating oil market . 
&quot; temperatures are modifying after they leave the Midwest and go East , &quot; Smith Barney analyst John saucer said .
