police tightened security around Hong Kong &apos;s spectacular suspension bridge on Sunday ahead of its gala opening by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , barely a week after a suspected sabotage attempt . 
tens of thousands of Hong Kong people are expected to throng the remote shores overlooking the world &apos;s largest road-rail suspension bridge for a fireworks extravaganza -- creating a logistics nightmare for police . 
thousands more have booked berths on a flotilla of pleasure boats to attend the party -- the last big British bash before an exhaustive series of celebrations get underway to mark the handover of Hong Kong to China in just 65 days time . 
anxiety about security is running high after cables at the bridge , which links Hong Kong to its new airport taking shape off the island of Lantau , were cut by saboteurs or vandals earlier this month . 
no arrests have been made and police are still investigating the case , which they classified as criminal damage . 
police spokesman Colin Keenan said the authorities were taking no chances -- and had contingency plans in place to cover all eventualities -- including guerrilla attacks on or near the 2.14-km ( 1.33-mile ) bridge . 
about 2,500 officers would be deployed in the area and a special command unit would act as nerve centre for traffic and crowd control management , Keenan said . 
though pipped for the record of the world &apos;s longest suspension bridge -- Britain &apos;s Humber bridge holds that honour -- the Tsing Ma bridge holds the record as the longest road-rail bridge , satisfying Hong Kong &apos;s obsession with superlatives . 
Hong Kong people love to boast of having the world &apos;s longest outdoor escalator , the world &apos;s busiest container port , and of holding the record for the greatest number of Rolls Royce cars per head . 
more than 300,000 tonnes of steel and concrete went into the construction of the 206-metre ( yard ) tall bridge . 
if unbundled , its wire suspension cables would girdle the earth four and a half times . 
when fully operational , it is expected to carry more than 30,000 passengers a day bound for the new airport . 
but the HK $ 7.2-billion ( $ 920-million ) bridge marks more than just an engineering feat . 
the completion on schedule of a vital -- and very visable -- component in the US $ 20-billion airport project represents a practical victory over the political row that dogged Sino-British relations over Hong Kong during the sensitive transitional years . 
China denounced the project , the world &apos;s largest infrastructure project , as extravagent and accused the British of trying to squander Hong Kong &apos;s wealth ahead of the handover . 
the bickering dragged on for more than five years before agreement was finally reached in 1995 . 
but in the meantime , the Hong Kong government quietly got on with the work . 
the airport is due to open in the middle of next year .
