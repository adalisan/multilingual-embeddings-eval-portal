South Africa &apos;s &quot; truth commission &quot; is closing in on former soldiers who have not joined their police colleagues in confessing to human rights abuses under apartheid , a senior official said on Thursday . 
Dumisa Ntsebeza , head of the investigations unit of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , told a news conference police had arrested a former soldier in Johannesburg on Wednesday and said more arrests were likely . 
he declined to identify the suspect , saying he was being held on criminal charges and had been on the commission &apos;s list to be called to testify on illegal military activities . 
&quot; I am sure that in the weeks or even days ahead , certain personalities will come to your attention whose apprehension will indicate that we are beginning to make inroads into certain units of the military establishment , &quot; he said . 
Ntsebeza said the commission recently received 29 amnesty applications relating to three bomb attacks on offices of anti-apartheid movements and the South African Council of Churches during the 1980s . 
in total , he said , about 135 police veterans had admitted to killing 200 people , to 30 bombings , 20 abductions and 15 thefts . 
in one major breakthrough , the commission revealed earlier this week that five former policemen had admitted beating to death Black consciousness Movement leader Steve Biko , an icon of the struggle against apartheid , in 1977 . 
&quot; It is clear from the applications that we have already received that we have made serious inroads into South African police illegal activities , &quot; Ntsebeza said . 
&quot; However , we have not as yet been so successful with the involvement of the military or with the official structures of the liberation movements . 
the commission has been given two years in which to trade judicial and civil indemnity for the truth about the enforcement of apartheid and the war against it . 
the commission does not have the power to order arrests . 
Ntsebeza said the commission would soon begin to put the squeeze on the military and on liberation movements , including President Nelson Mandela &apos;s African National Congress . 
he said the commission was studying a number of secret reports and documents , adding : &quot; We have a fair indication as to where we can begin to apply pressure for disclosure . 
Ntsebeza said he was convinced that apartheid cabinet ministers were directly involved in police activities . 
&quot; Our theory is that it does not go as high up only as the generals . 
there is a sense in which , with some of the operations and the scale that they took on , something must have been said of the operation at the level of the ministries . 
&quot; But I cannot say that that is what the applications show conclusively , &quot; he said .
