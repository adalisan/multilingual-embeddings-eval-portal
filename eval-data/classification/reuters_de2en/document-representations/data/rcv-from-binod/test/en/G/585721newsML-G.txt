Canada &apos;s capital is poised to allow women to go topless at municipal pools and beaches , a city councillor said on Thursday . 
if approved by the city council next week as expected , Ottawa would become the first city in Ontario -- Canada &apos;s most populous province -- to permit topless sun bathing at city-run facilities . 
the move comes amid a controversy over topless women that was sparked in 1991 when a woman from Guelph , Ontario , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) southwest of Toronto , was fined for strolling topless . 
last December Ontario &apos;s highest court overturned the woman &apos;s indecency conviction , effectively making it legal for women to go topless in public . 
the Ottawa policy would mean women could sun themselves topless at city facilities as well . 
&quot; We don &apos;t want our lifeguards to become the breast police , &quot; City Councillor Diane deans said in a phone interview .
