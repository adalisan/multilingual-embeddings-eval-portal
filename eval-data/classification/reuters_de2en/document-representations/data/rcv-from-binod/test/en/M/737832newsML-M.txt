Philippine shares heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday on a cut in overnight interest rates although gains tapered off near the close of session , traders said . 
the main index snapped out of a two-day losing streak , settling 33.02 points up , or 1.28 percent , at 2,620.38 . 
the index closed off its intra-day high of 2,638.87 points . 
&quot; While it is good domestically that interest rates are lowered , the attack on the peso is not just a local problem so people are still keeping a close eye on the forex market . 
buying is still restrained , &quot; said one foreign broker . 
&quot; There &apos;s a temporary recovery of the market helped by the trade deficit figures and the lowering of the overnight rates , implying a bit of stability of the currency , &quot; said Cilette Liboro , research head at Orion-Squire Capital . 
the Central Bank lowered its overnight borrowing rate by four percentage points on Thursday . 
prior to the start of trade , the National Statistics Office said trade deficit in the first five months of the year narrowed to $ 4.727 billion from $ 5.09 billion . 
Angping &amp; Associates Securities research head Gina Tan said lower overnight rates may have directed some funds from the fixed-income securities back to the stock market . 
traders expect the market on Friday to continue taking its cue from developments in the foreign exchange market . 
&quot; We are still waiting for stability . 
bargain hunters will be able to drive stocks up but the more sober minds would probably wait , &quot; said Bing Trininad , sales manager at DBS Securities . 
&quot; We can &apos;t expect too many miracles . 
we are still in a soul-searching mood , &quot; Manuel Goseco , analyst at Dharmala Securities said .
