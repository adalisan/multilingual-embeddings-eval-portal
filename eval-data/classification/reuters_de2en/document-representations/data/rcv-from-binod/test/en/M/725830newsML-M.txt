Asian naphtha extended its rally on Monday amid a squeeze on prompt barrels but players were cautious the rise would continue because of fears about fresh exports from the Gulf and a possible re-opening of the East-West arbitrage , traders said . 
traders said higher crude helped prices higher . 
August Brent rose 13 cents on Friday in London and had gained a further 18 cents to last trade at $ 18.27 on Monday . 
&quot; The market is strong right now because the Thai &apos;s have bought most of the available prompt cargoes around but its not clear if this trend will continue , &quot; a trader said . 
firmer prices were helped by short covering of prompt cargoes by some traders , which included an early August cargo at $ 1.00 per barrel above spot Singapore quotes on free-on-board basis , traders said . 
traders said most of the available arbitrage cargoes from the Mediterranean were already sold to Thailand but surplus cargoes from the Gulf remained for August lifting . 
&quot; If all the surplus AG ( Gulf ) barrels are absorbed then this market has really turned around , &quot; one trader said . 
Naphtha had been trading in contago over the past three months due to the large exports of arbitrage cargoes from the West which took the market a long time to digest . 
traders said they were concerned that if the market actually takes off , a new round of arbitrage might be triggered leaving them back at square one . 
&quot; We need the West to pick up as well for prices to increase all round , &quot; a trader said . 
the current strength was clearly seen in the last Indian naphtha sale tender awards which traders said worked back to around $ 10 per tonne above the previous award . 
India sold 25,000 tonnes of low aromatic naphtha at $ 33.75 per tonne discount to spot U.S. Gulf 87 octane gasoline quotes on a free-on-board Bombay July 20-22 lifting . 
it also sold 27,000 tonnes of high aromatic naphtha at $ 32.80 per tonne discount to spot U.S. Gulf 87 octane gasoline quotes on a free-on-board Madras July 24-26 lifting . 
both cargoes were sold to Swiss trader Glencore , traders said . 
gasoline also edged up in line with the firmer crude market with fundamentals seen unchanged . 
traders said the Saudi Aramco tender to sell 32,000 to 35,000 tonnes of 98-octane unleaded reformate at around $ 4.20 per barrel above spot Singapore naphtha quotes on a free-on-board basis . 
the cargo is for July 26-28 lifting from Jubail on the Red Sea .
