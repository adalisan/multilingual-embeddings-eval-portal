Indian police on Saturday pasted posters on the walls of troubled Kashmir &apos;s biggest city , offering a one million rupee ( $ 28,000 ) reward for information on four Westerners taken hostage 17 months ago . 
the posters in Srinagar , summer capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir , carried pictures of American Donald Hutchings , German Dirk Hasert and Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells , kidnapped by shadowy Al-Faran guerrillas in July 1995 . 
the reward was announced on Thursday . 
&quot; We have already sent several police parties for pasting and distributing these posters across the valley , but our main concern will be Doda and south Kashmir regions , &quot; Mohammad Amin Shah , head of a team probing the abductions , told Reuters . 
the hilly district of Doda is a guerrilla stronghold in southern Kashmir where the four Westerners were abducted on a Himalayan trek . 
one other hostage , American John Childs , escaped while a sixth , Hans Christian Ostroe of Norway , was found beheaded in August 1995 . 
&quot; Soon , through radio , television and local newspapers , we will publicise this reward , &quot; Shah said . 
dozens of Moslem guerrilla groups have been fighting New Delhi &apos;s rule in the state , mainly Hindu India &apos;s only Moslem majority province . 
more than 20,000 people have died in violence linked to a rebellion that broke out in 1990 .
