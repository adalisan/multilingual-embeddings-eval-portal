hurricane Edouard , packing winds of 130 miles per hour ( 208 kph ) as it moves toward the U.S. East Coast , will not be a threat to business interests at least until the weekend , if at all , a forecaster said Tuesday . 
&quot; The bottom line is that Edouard will have virtually no impact on energy or agriculture related interests from now through Saturday , &quot; Jon Davis , a forecaster at Smith Barney in Chicago , said in a daily meterological report . 
Davis said , however , there was a chance the storm , now about 1,200 miles east of Miami , could become a threat to certain business interest on the East Coast . 
&quot; Items that have to be monitored if the storm does make landfall will be possible impacts to the Southeast cotton agricultural belt and energy operations in and around the New York Harbor area , &quot; Davis said . 
he said the storm was now moving in a west-northwest direction at 15 miles per hour , but was likely to begin moving in an increasingly northwesterly direction . 
&quot; Because it will be moving in a more northward direction over time , the most likely spots for landfall will be those that tend to jut out in the Atlantic -- the coastal areas of North Carolina or Cape Cod ( Massachusetts ) , &quot; Davis said . 
he added that while it was still too early to say whether the storm will make landfall , his sense was that it would not touch land at all , and will instead head out to sea . 
&quot; For what it is worth , my gut feeling is that Hurricane Edouard will veer north and then northeast and not hit the East Coast of the U.S. , &quot; he said .
