a quarter of a million people marched through Belgrade on Sunday on the 28th day of protests against alleged government election fraud and , in an important development , a court restored an opposition victory in one city . 
demonstrations spread across Serbia to 30 towns and cities , 13 more than on Saturday , with the sheer size of the crowds posing an increasingly vocal challenge to President Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s rule . 
&quot; This is bigger than Saturday &apos;s protest , &quot; a reporter for independent Belgrade radio B92 radio said of the capital &apos;s mass rally . 
&quot; It &apos;s the biggest so far , it &apos;s enormous . 
after the main Belgrade rally tens of thousands of students joined a torchlit procession around the city &apos;s wintry streets carrying lanterns , candles and flashlights . 
in a significant breakthrough for the opposition , a court in the southern city of Nis ordered the local election commission to hand back victory won in the elections to leaders of the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition . 
U.S. envoy John Kornblum met Serbian opposition leaders in Geneva and issued a stern message to Milosevic . 
&quot; We believe it is now essential for Mr. Milosevic to accept the result of the elections . 
&quot; We will continue our support of the democratic processes and expect that ( the same ) of Milosevic really as the price for any further movement in relations ... That is a very strong position which gives Milosevic a clear signal of our support for the democratic process . 
the opposition was adamant that its support was rock solid and that street protests would continue on Monday . 
Zajedno leader Zoran Djindjic said Milosevic must reverse the alleged fraud at November &apos;s local elections which enabled the ruling socialists to claim victory over Zajedno in 14 out of Serbia &apos;s 18 biggest towns and cities , including Belgrade . 
&quot; Our protests will last until Serbia becomes a legal state , &quot; Djindjic told Reuters . 
the Nis district court upheld Zajedno &apos;s appeal and ordered the city election commission effectively to endorse the opposition victory , local Zajedno leader Zoran Zivkovic said . 
&quot; This shows that we might be after all on the road to justice , &quot; Vesna Pesic of Zajedno told the Belgrade rally . 
a student spokesman said the intention of the student torchlit procession was &quot; to enlighten a city in political darkness . 
the students were cheered along the route by bystanders and people waving from windows and balconies , switching off and on the electric lights in their homes in gestures of support . 
&quot; There is a terrific uproar , everything that can burn is burning : candles , lanterns , flashlights ... 10 or more drums beating the samba , &quot; a reporter said . 
Milosevic has remained largely silent about the protests apart from inviting a team of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) to look into the matter .
