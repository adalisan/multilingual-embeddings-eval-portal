Australian Open champion Boris Becker will play in next month &apos;s European Community Championship ( ECC ) , organisers said on Thursday . 
&quot; This is our greatest satisfaction . 
he was the first one to register and didn &apos;t ask for anything , &quot; tournament director Georges Baudeweyns said . 
the field of the $ 1.0 million tournament , famous for a diamond-encrusted golden trophy , also includes world number four Yevgeny Kafelnikov and defending champion Michael Stich . 
other entries in the February 17-23 tournament include Swedish world number nine Thomas Enqvist and number 11 Marcelo Rios of Chile . 
Baudeweyns said several grand slam winners had expressed interest in the two remaining wild cardsb but stopped short of naming Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek and world number one Pete Sampras . 
&quot; I &apos;m not allowed to , &quot; he said when asked why he declined to name Krajicek and Sampras . 
the Antwerp trophy , shaped like a racket , is the prize for anyone who wins the event three times in five years .
