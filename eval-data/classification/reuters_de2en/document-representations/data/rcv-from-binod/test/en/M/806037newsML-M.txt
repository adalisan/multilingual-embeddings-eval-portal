heavy rains in dry areas of the central U.S. Midwest over the weekend caused CBOT soybeans to end mostly lower Monday , traders said . 
&quot; We &apos;re lower today on rain , but I don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to see a straight sell-off until harvest when there &apos;s no longer a frost threat , &quot; said Paul Moravek , floor trader with LIT . 
over the weekend , parts of central Illinois , Indiana and Ohio received one to two inches of rain . 
that precipitation , combined with last week &apos;s showers , were said to be adequate to reverse the effects of moisture stress , traders said . 
traders awaited this afternoon &apos;s weekly crop progress data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and expected to see an improvement in the crop ratings of two to five percent . 
last week , 55 percent of the crop was rated good to excellent , according to USDA data . 
trade in August soybeans continued to be volatile as traders continued to exit positions before expiration at noon on Wednesday . 
CBOT November soybeans ended 3-1 / 4 lower at $ 6.08 per bushel , and other contracts were 6-1 / 4 lower to two higher . 
futures losses were stemmed by larger-than-expected weekly export shipments , traders said . 
USDA put weekly export inspections for the week ended August 14 at 8.774 million bushels . 
that figure came in at the high end of trade expectations for five million to eight million bushels . 
also , Mexico was said to have purchased on Thursday last week , 40,000 tonnes of soybeans for October shipment by rail , floor traders and U.S. exporters said . 
on the day , Cargill investor Services and Tenco each bought two million bushels November . 
Dean Witter sold one million November and Smith Barney traded one million November , pit sources . 
in spread trade , Chicago Corp. spread one million November / August and 500,000 tonnes of September / August , traders said . 
in options , Produce grain sold 500 November $ 6.50 calls , bought 200 November $ 6.00 puts and sold 200 November $ 5.75 puts , pit traders said . 
soybean futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 39,000 contracts , compared with Friday &apos;s actual volume of 42,454 contracts .
