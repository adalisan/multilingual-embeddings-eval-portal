Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Tuesday publicly backed a peace deal signed by security chief Alexander Lebed and Chechen rebel leaders . 
&quot; The agreements signed by Lebed cause some concern but on the whole we consider them right , &quot; Chernomyrdin , who discussed the issue with President Boris Yeltsin on Monday , told a meeting of top North Caucasus officials . 
&quot; We should act within the framework of these agreements and keep to their thrust . 
in Moscow , Lebed told a news conference that about 80,000 people had been killed in fighting in breakaway Chechnya since Russian troops entered the region in December 1994 to crush its bid for independence . 
&quot; One may say that about 80,000 people have died , plus or minus 10,000 , &quot; Lebed said . 
&quot; accordingly there are three times as many injured . 
fighting in Chechnya died down last month after Lebed signed a ceasefire with the rebels , followed by a political agreement last weekend . 
Lebed is secretary of Russia &apos;s policy-making Security Council , which was given sweeping powers by Yeltsin last month to tackle the Chechen crisis after rebels seized most of the capital Grozny in an offensive that humiliated Moscow . 
Chernomyrdin told the meeting in the ethnic republic of Kabardino-Balkaria that the decision to defer by five years a final decision on Chechnya &apos;s status -- the most sensitive issue in talks -- was right . 
&quot; We should calm down and this issue should be resolved in five years , maybe with the help of a referendum . 
Chernomyrdin said the Kremlin &apos;s initial decision to send troops to Chechnya &quot; did not produce the required results , led to a dead end and to grave consequences &quot; . 
&quot; We must sort out this disgrace and I would even say shame , &quot; he said . 
Yeltsin , on holiday at a country residence northwest of Moscow , has not yet commented publicly on Lebed &apos;s peace agreement . 
but Chernomyrdin &apos;s comments suggested that the Kremlin leader would also give a cautious nod of approval . 
Lebed , who is Yeltsin &apos;s personal envoy to Chechnya , has still to report to the president after his talks with rebel Chief-of-Staff Aslan Maskhadov . 
a further apparent snub came to Lebed from the Kremlin late on Tuesday in the form of an announcement that Yeltsin had decorated his bitter rival , Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov . 
the award , &quot; for services to the fatherland &quot; , appeared designed to show Lebed that he was out of line when he called for Kulikov &apos;s dismissal earlier this month for alleged mishandling of the Chechen conflict . 
in addition to postponing a decision on Chechnya &apos;s status , Lebed &apos;s accord also involves setting up a joint commission to oversee economic reconstruction and the withdrawal of troops . 
most Russian troops have been withdrawn from Grozny and southern mountain regions in the past week , but federal forces remain on Chechen soil , mainly at bases near Grozny . 
Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin &apos;s spokesman as saying on Monday that Russia &apos;s territorial integrity was paramount and that &quot; the political price of the deal &quot; had yet to be discussed . 
analysts have speculated that Lebed and Chernomyrdin have been wrangling over Chechnya to further their own careers should something happen to Yeltsin and elections be held early . 
Lebed has made no secret of his presidential ambitions , and Chernomyrdin , who would take over for up to three months in the event of Yeltsin being incapacitated , is widely regarded as another possible successor . 
Yeltsin , 65 , who suffered two heart attacks last year , has rarely been seen in public since late June and his failure to meet Lebed has raised speculation about his health . 
but presidential aides say his health is no cause for concern .
