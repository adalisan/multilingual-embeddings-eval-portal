a record closing high on the Dow Jones did little to help Mexican stocks Friday , which reversed early gains and ended slightly lower . 
the leading IPC index closed 7.34 points down , or 0.22 percent , at 3,311.61 points . 
local market traders attributed lower stock prices to Mexico &apos;s political situation , but a major U.S.-based analyst said fundamental and technical factors carried the day . 
&quot; News of alleged tax fraud by the newspaper El Universal definitely gave investers the jitters , &quot; said Roberto Solano , a top analyst at the Estrategia Bursatil brokerage . 
the arrest of the newspapers &apos; editor prompted charges of government censorship by the newspaper and other observers . 
but stocks slid for fundamental and technical reasons rather than political ones , said Jorge Mariscal , head of Latin American equity analysis at Goldman Sachs in New York . 
&quot; We &apos;re looking towards 1997 and wondering if current growth rates are sustainable , &quot; Mariscal said , pointing out that the IPC index has outstripped the Dow Jones so far this year , and that second-quarter growth figures looked good only when compared to spectacular lows in 1995 . 
shares issued by Situr and its holding company Sidek led gainers on market rumours , denied by Situr &apos;s CEO , that the company was going to sell off hotels to ease debts . 
Glassmaker vitro chalked up gains after a roller-coaster day . 
it ended up 80 centavos higher at 17 pesos ( $ 2.26 ) on news that it obtained a deal to sell assets from its troubled U.S. unit anchor Glass Corp. , which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws . 
volume was higher than on Thursday but still low at 82.2 million shares .
