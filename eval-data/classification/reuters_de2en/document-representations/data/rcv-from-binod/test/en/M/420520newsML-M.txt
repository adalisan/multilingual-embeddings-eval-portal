West African crude markets continued to struggle under heavy unsold volumes on Wednesday , with further price falls needed to stimulate buying , traders said . 
&quot; If you have no buyers then you have to let prices fall . 
you have to let the oil go sooner or later , &quot; said one trader active in the West African market . 
Market-watchers estimated that just one third of the Nigerian March loading programme was already sold . 
&quot; There are quite a few cargoes , the market hasn &apos;t hit its floor yet , &quot; another trader said . 
West African barrels were seen offered in abundance into the U.S. Gulf coast with bonny Light and qua Iboe valued by refiners at around dated Brent plus $ 1.80-90 a barrel delivered , netting back to around dated Brent plus 30 to 40 cents on an fob basis . 
&quot; That &apos;s definitely a buyer &apos;s number . 
for a VLCC you &apos;re looking at freight of around $ 1.50 a barrel , so ( dated Brent + $ 1.80 / 90 ) is a pretty low number , &quot; a trader said . 
rumours that a bonny Light cargo had sold into the U.S. Gulf on Monday could not be confirmed . 
Distillate-rich Forcados was pegged as low as dated Brent + 15 / 25 cents fob . 
West African grades were also seen offered to Mediterranean refiners , but to scant buying interest . 
an Iraqi Kirkuk Blend cargo loading at Ceyhan around March 10 was still being peddled around the market on Wednesday . 
the seller was trying to elicit buying interest before showing a price , traders said . 
&quot; They &apos;re not showing a price , but I think it has to be 20 or more ( discount to the March OSP of dated Brent - $ 1.55 ) , &quot; a trader said . 
European refiners also reported being offered Iraqi Basrah Light , which loads at the Gulf terminal of Mina al-Bakr , but said that it was even less attractive than Kirkuk . 
Russian Urals was still assessed at dated Brent - $ 1.00 / $ 0.90 a barrel , drawing some short-term support from maintenance work at the main Russian outlet of Novorossiisk . 
a smaller pipeline feeding Novorossiisk started pumping again early on Wednesday , but the main 660,000-barrel per day ( bpd ) line was not due back again until Thursday , shipping sources said .
