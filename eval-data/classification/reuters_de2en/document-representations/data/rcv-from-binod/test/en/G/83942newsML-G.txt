Palestinian minister Hanan Ashrawi on Sunday called for the United States to rescue the Middle East peace process . 
Hanan , a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council , accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a U.S. television interview of reneging on agreements and &quot; playing havoc with the peace process &quot; . 
she called on the United States at next week &apos;s Washington summit between Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to ensure agreements already signed were implemented immediately . 
&quot; We have been warning repeatedly ... that this Israeli government is bringing us to the brink of the abyss and that we really need a serious and courageous reassessment and to rescue the peace talks from Prime Minister Netanyahu &apos;s actions , &quot; she told the Fox News Sunday programme . 
Ashrawi said Netanyahu , in blaming Palestinian leader Yasser Araft for the outbreak of hostilities , had started looking for a scapegoat despite his own military intelligence telling him the situation was volatile . 
&quot; This shows either a total lack of awareness or a deliberate manipulation of facts . 
either of these is dangerous enough in a person who holds the peace process hostage , &quot; she added . 
she urged the U.S. to ensure agreements were implemented , including &quot; redeployments on Hebron , redployments on the rest of the West Bank , opening the safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza and releasing Palestinian prisoners . 
&quot; All these are signed agreements Netanyahu has reneged on , &quot; she said . 
she said this week &apos;s outbreak of violence , which has claimed nearly 70 lives , was because &quot; the whole Palestinian territories are treated like a massive prison .
