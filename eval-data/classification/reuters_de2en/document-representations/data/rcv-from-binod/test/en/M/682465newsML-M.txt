precious metals prices were mostly easier on Tuesday afternoon as the dollar and the Dow recovered from Monday &apos;s falls , dealers said . 
the differences were fairly slight , however , after follow-through to short covering in New York on Monday was limited in the Far East and Europe . 
gold was fixed at $ 338.35 per ounce , against $ 338.65 in the morning and $ 338.00 on Monday afternoon . 
the Dow Jones Industrial average gained 78 points on its opening and the dollar gained against the mark and the yen , but the day &apos;s highs remained below 1.725 and 115 respectively . 
gold firmed late Monday on short covering following a comment from the Japanese Prime Minister that his government had considered selling from reserves of U.S. treasury bills and buying gold . 
the comments caused turmoil in U.S. financial markets , but a Ministry of Finance official later said they had been misinterpreted . 
&quot; After these comments , and the Dow and the dollar coming off , gold &apos;s reaction has been disappointing , &quot; one dealer said . 
another bluntly said the markets were going down . 
dealers focused more on a 7,000-lot increase in COMEX open interest posted on Friday . 
&quot; There seems to be a big bet by the funds on the downside and that is why gold didn &apos;t shoot up , &quot; one dealer said . 
a question for gold would be whether or not the floor at $ 335 / $ 336 could hold to take the market back to the top of its range around $ 342.00 , dealers said . 
they reported some borrowing in gold overnight and sales from Australia , which suggested producer selling . 
silver was also easier at $ 4.78 / $ 4.80 , down two cents and attracting scant interest after its bounce over $ 4.80 on Monday . 
platinum and palladium eased after holding the levels of late last week on Monday . 
they were seen likely to drift further . 
dealers said latest &quot; no delay &quot; comments from officials at Russia &apos;s Almaz export agency were largely ignored . 
&quot; There has been a bit of selling in palladium and a bit of liquidity coming in , &quot; a dealer said . 
one-month borrowing rates were quoted at 30-60 percent and 50-90 percent for platinum and palladium respectively . 
platinum was quoted at $ 410.50 / $ 415.50 , down $ 4.50 , and palladium at $ 195.50 / $ 200.50 , down $ 1.00 .
