the People &apos;s Liberation Army entered Hong Kong this month to cheering crowds , but few here have forgotten the bloody suppression of student-led protests by China &apos;s army in Beijing in 1989 . 
now stationed in Hong Kong , the PLA is plotting a different assault -- a charm offensive to polish its image and &quot; win hearts and minds &quot; in the former British colony . 
the Chinese top brass are considering &quot; an open day &quot; for Hong Kong residents to meet and mingle with the men in green . 
soldiers are carrying books on etiquette and there is even talk of summer camps on PLA bases for local youth . 
some 4,700 Chinese troops took up position in Hong Kong on July 1 after Britain handed this colony of 156 years back to China . 
their commander , Major-General Liu Zhenwu , plans to open up parts of the territory &apos;s army camps to make contact with the Hong Kong public , the China-controlled Wen Wei Po newspaper said . 
&quot; We plan to have an open day , but it &apos;s not finalised yet , &quot; said a PLA officer , who declined to be named . 
&quot; This is mainly to communicate and have contact with Hong Kong people . 
to meet and deepen our relationship , &quot; he said . 
many of Hong Kong &apos;s 6.4 million people have been apprehensive about the PLA troops , remembering their bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square in 1989 . 
the PLA is aware of the need to polish up its image . 
military leaders have exhorted the troops to &quot; love Hong Kong people &quot; and to &quot; win hearts and minds &quot; . 
the soldiers carry handbooks on local customs and are learning the local Chinese dialect , Cantonese . 
at the gun Club Hill barracks near the Tsim Sha Tsui shopping area , the PLA has covered some of its armoured personnel carriers with green tarpaulins , while half of the 21-vehicle fleet sits in an enclosed garage . 
&quot; It &apos;s because of the heavy rain , &quot; a sentry said curtly when asked why the armoured cars had been tucked away . 
the PLA garrison is confined largely to an external defence role and takes its orders from Beijing . 
Hong Kong &apos;s leader , Tung Chee-hwa , who enjoys strong backing from China , has given assurances the PLA cannot go into action in Hong Kong to deal with internal problems such as natural disasters or unrest unless he requests assistance . 
feared by some and certainly mysterious to many , the soldiers have had to live under Hong Kong &apos;s probing eyes . 
local media have spotlighted how truckloads of meat and vegetables were arriving from just across the border with China to feed the soldiers as consumer items were just too pricey in Hong Kong . 
in some camps in rural areas , fields have been redesignated for farming . 
in one camp , PLA soldiers can now grow their own vegetables and raise fish and pigs . 
barely two weeks after arrival , the average soldier was given a 900 percent pay rise to 500-600 yuan ( $ 60-72 ) a month , or nine times what his counterparts on the mainland get . 
but facilities that the British army used may be too luxurious for the PLA to afford . 
a mansion in the posh Mid-Levels district which was the official residence of the last British garrison chief is likely to be used only as a guest house , officials say . 
somewhat awkward and unfamiliar to local ways , the garrison has come under attack for a series of public relations gaffes . 
at a recent meeting between Tung and Major-General Liu , the PLA provided exclusive access for the mainland &apos;s China Central Television , while keeping out the unhappy local media . 
but the men in PLA green are stirring into action to endear themselves to Hong Kong . 
&quot; We are discussing organising a press relations department , &quot; another PLA officer , who declined to be named , said . 
and the gesture is not merely one-way . 
patriotic communities in Hong Kong have been quick to welcome the PLA . 
the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the betterment of Hong Kong has proposed summer camps for students to give them contact with the PLA . 
and some community leaders have offered to organise a party at a PLA barracks complete with singing , dancing and a dinner for up to 5,000 Hong Kong residents .
