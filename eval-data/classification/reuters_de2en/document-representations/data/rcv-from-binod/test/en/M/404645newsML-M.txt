uncertainty about the amount of oat deliveries and almost universal expectations for heavy wheat deliveries were central market talking points going into Friday , first notice day for deliveries on Chicago Board of Trade March contracts , traders said . 
&quot; All of the wheat will be delivered . 
no one wants it because of the vomitoxin , &quot; a trader said . 
nearly all the deliverable supply of wheat is located in Toledo , and there were widespread concerns about reports of vomitoxin in the soft red winter wheat crop harvested and stored last summer . 
as of early Wednesday there were 2,494,709 bushels of wheat in Toledo registered for possible delivery and 20,202 bushels registered in Chicago , according to the CBOT . 
a commodity that has been registered indicates it is eligible to be delivered but does not necessarily mean that it will be delivered . 
Oat registrations totaled 3,180,000 bushels , all of it in Minneapolis . 
some traders thought most of the registered oats would be posted for delivery because of the steep premium nearby March CBOT oats hold to the May . 
but other trade sources suggested oat deliveries would be light because of uncertainty about the opportunity to transport oats by rail from Canada to the United States . 
Canada continues to struggle with transportation problems . 
soybean deliveries initially were expected to be light , from zero to 300,000 bushels , but there was some talk the registrations soon could increase and deliveries could be up to two million bushels . 
early Wednesday the soybean registrations were at only 985,000 bushels and all in Toledo , enhancing the calls for a small amount of soybeans to be delivered . 
as of 1205 CST the March contract was trading at only three cents per bushel under the May , which would encourage commercials to store rather than deliver the soybeans . 
traders expected no corn to be posted for delivery . 
the March contract remains about even with the May which would keep the corn out of the delivery market , they said . 
also as of early Wednesday there were only 5,000 bushels of corn registered , all in Chicago , according to the CBOT . 
no soymeal deliveries were expected but soyoil deliveries were expected to exceed 2,000 lots . 
as of Tuesday , there was no soymeal registered in deliverable locations and 5,012 lots of soyoil registered , according to CBOT . 
trade sources noted cash soyoil prices were at 1.50 cent per lb under CBOT March futures . 
commercial interests could take advantage of the futures market premium by delivering supplies , traders said . 
the opposite was true for soymeal where cash premiums remained well above CBOT market value . 
cash soymeal in Chicago was quoted at $ 8.00 per ton over CBOT March as of Wednesday .
