Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said on Wednesday the world should not be indifferent to what she called &quot; the rise of a fundamentalist Hindu India &quot; bent on deploying nuclear missiles . 
&quot; India &apos;s pursuit of a nuclear and ballistic weapons programme is of serious concern . 
of equal concern is its reluctance to engage in a meaningful dialogue on the issues of nuclear and conventional arms control bilaterally , regionally or globally , &quot; she said . 
Bhutto was addressing a closed meeting of foreign ministers of the 53-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference , held annually during the U.N. General Assembly . 
according to a copy of her speech obtained later , she said : &quot; The world cannot remain indifferent to the rise of a fundamentalist Hindu India bent on producing and deploying nuclear capable ballistic missiles , with the aim to target every major city from Yemen to the Straits of Malacca . 
the Strait of Malacca separates Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula . 
Bhutto , who was due to address the U.N. 
Assembly on Thursday , also said India &apos;s development of a deep-water navy and nuclear-powered submarines &quot; armed to dominate the international waterways from the Suez to the Straits of Malacca and beyond , are of concern to the entire Ummah &quot; ( Islamic people ) . 
the prime minister , whose speech was almost entirely devoted to the long-running dispute over Kashmir , India &apos;s only Moslem-majority state , said the time had come for the international community to address the issue squarely . 
&quot; Political or commercial expediencies must not be allowed to erode the foundations of the international system , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Islam calls upon all Moslems to follow the path of righteousness , of justice and to face with full vigour and determination an oppressor and oppression . 
Bhutto , whose country has insisted for more than 40 years that Kashmir &apos;s fate should be determined in a U.N.-brokered plebiscite , called on the world body to &quot; fulfill its historic responsibility towards the people of Kashmir . 
referring to an uprising against Indian rule in the Kashmir Valley which erupted in 1990 , she said : &quot; If the United Nations fails to act , it will compel the Kashmiris to continue to wage their heroic struggle to reverse the occupation by all possible means .
