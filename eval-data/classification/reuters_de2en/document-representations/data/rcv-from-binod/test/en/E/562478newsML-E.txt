Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Tuesday said he expected real GDP growth for the first quarter to be &quot; about zero percent &quot; , year-on-year , after growth of 4.6 percent in the first three months of 1996 . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t be surprised if we will be somewhere around zero percent ( GDP ) , &quot; Klaus said at a lecture at the Prague School of Economics . 
industrial output in the Czech Republic contracted in the first two months of 1997 . 
the trade deficit hit a record 160.3 billion crowns in 1996 , and is expected to surge to some 200 billion this year . 
the Czech economy recorded real growth of 4.4 percent in 1996 , but a downturn in industry has sent economists scrambling to revise their forecasts downward . 
on April 16 , the government announced a series of economic measures aimed at reviving the economy while easing pressures from a burgeoning trade deficit and rising wages . 
during the announcement , Klaus said he would consider it a success if Czech real GDP growth was 2.7 percent , one-half of the government &apos;s original estimate for 1997 .
