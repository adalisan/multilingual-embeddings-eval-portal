Ecuador &apos;s deposed President Abdala Bucaram filed a petition with the Supreme Court on Wednesday asking it to start legal proceedings against interim President Fabian Alarcon for conspiracy . 
Bucaram , who was dismissed by Ecuador &apos;s Congress last month for &quot; mental incompetence &quot; and is now living in Panama , sent a letter to Supreme Court President Carlos Solorzano demanding that Alarcon be jailed pending trial . 
&quot; We are going to present a private suit demanding jail for Alarcon in order to put things in order again and get Congress to restore the presidency to Abdala Bucaram , &quot; former prosecutor Leonidas Plaza told reporters . 
in his letter to the Supreme Court , a copy of which was made available to Reuters , Bucaram said the &quot; mental incapacity &quot; charge levelled at him by Congress &quot; has not been proved legally as the Constitution requires &quot; by medical experts . 
Bucaram was ousted after six months in power in a wave of popular protest and strikes against his tough economic reforms and eccentric personal style . 
his stunts included singing in a rock band and lunch with Lorena Bobbit , the Ecuadorean-born American famous for slicing off her husband &apos;s penis . 
the government of Alarcon , named interim president until 1998 , has filed suits against Bucaram for alleged mishandling and illegal appropriation of public funds . 
the military has declared him &quot; persona non grata &quot; and plans to sue him for &quot; insulting the honour &quot; of the forces and the country . 
Bucaram continues to call himself president from exile in Panama , where he lived from 1985-90 after he fleeing charges of corruption as mayor of his home city Guayaquil .
