one of the guerrillas holding at least 200 people hostage in the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima is hurt and needs a doctor , the German ambassador to Peru , himself a hostage , told Bonn on Wednesday . 
Ambassador Heribert Woeckel telephoned the Bonn Foreign Ministry at around 1700 GMT to say the situation was calm and that , in the circumstances , he was well , a ministry spokesman said . 
&quot; We are not suffering , &quot; he was quoted as saying . 
Woeckel said one of the hostage-takers was wounded , but the ministry did not specify how he had been hurt . 
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement guerrillas allowed a 1615 GMT deadline to pass , apparently without incident . 
instead they asked for medicine to treat wounded from the assault on the residence . 
they did not say who was injured . 
the guerrillas are trying to secure the release of up to 500 jailed comrades . 
the hostages include senior diplomats and government ministers who were attending a reception .
