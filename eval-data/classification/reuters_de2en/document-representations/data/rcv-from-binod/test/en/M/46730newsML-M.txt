German shares closed slightly lower on Wednesday after the U.S. Dow Jones index &apos;s strong start helped them overcome early weakness caused by renewed tensions between the U.S. and Iraq and interest rate concerns . 
the DAX index of Germany &apos;s 30 leading blue-chips closed trade 4.15 points , or 0.16 percent , down at 2,566.80 points , practically unchanged from opening levels . 
the continued firmness of the dollar against the mark provided some support for shares but dealers said the market still risked losing gains made earlier this week . 
&quot; The market &apos;s been overbought , the dollar &apos;s been overbought and people are starting to take profits , &quot; said one dealer . 
traders said the market dipped on news of Iraqi attacks on U.S. jets and would be watching carefully whether the strikes would result in a heightening of tension between Washington and Baghdad . 
the mood of uncertainty is further set to intensify from Thursday ahead of a raft of U.S. data due on Thursday and Friday which could be taken as a possible influence on U.S. interest rates . 
&quot; Concern will start making itself felt more from tomorrow , &quot; one dealer said , noting the publication of U.S. August producer prices and the latest U.S. money supply data due on Thursday . 
export-led stocks showed early gains because of the higher dollar but later fell back as the dollar edged off its day-highs . 
chemicals group Hoechst AG was one of the few to cling on to gains , ending electronic trade up 70 pfennigs at 53.60 marks . 
the comments come after a recent interview with Piech that he was seeking in the coming years to secure a ten-fold increase in VW &apos;s current return on sales level .
