North Sea crudes were steady on Thursday despite a weaker wet Brent deal , traders said . 
the March 29-31 cargo traded at April Brent -90 cents a barrel , but other North Sea grades showed signs of firming . 
&quot; For the grades things are looking up , &quot; said a trader . 
forties sellers reported bids of between dated Brent + 10 / + 15 cents a barrel for April loading cargoes . 
in the Mediterranean sour crude markets remained depressed with demand for distillate-laden crudes minimal as refiners switched to lighter gasoline-rich crudes where seasonally better profit margins lie , traders said . 
avails of most grades were seen ample although traders saw the sale of some 300,000 barrels of Iraqi Kirkuk into Northwest Europe taking some of the current pressure off prices for Russian Urals cargoes . 
prompt and cross-month Urals cargoes were offered at around dated Brent - $ 1.20 but traders said stiff competition from other grades kept nearest bids 20 cents below this . 
negotiations for April lifting Syrian crudes were at a stalemate with state oil firm Sytrol holding offers at dated Brent -78 cents for Syrian light , some 28 cents below the OSP for March . 
heavy Souedie was offered at dated Brent - $ 4.60 with bids around dated Brent - $ 5.00- $ 5.25 a tonne . 
Algerian Saharan Blend contracts for April were reported offered at + 43 cents around half the March OSP , but traders said there was little buying interest here either . 
much West African trade was shrouded by widespread insistence on confidential terms , with sellers unwilling to disclose apparently weak traded values . 
mid-April loaders were the main market for end-users but the back end of March remained a distraction , with three cargoes of Forcados and a qua Iboe still unsold .
