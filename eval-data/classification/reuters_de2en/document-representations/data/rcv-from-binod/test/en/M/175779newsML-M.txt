about a million shares of Uchumi supermarket traded on the three-day offer board boosted turnover at the Nairobi Stock Exchange ( NSE ) on Friday , brokers said . 
turnover was posted at 56.511 million shillings traded on 1,251,667 shares compared to 8.437 million shillings traded on 337,743 shares on Thursday . 
but the Uchumi performance failed to spread gains across the board , with the 20-share index closing 5.31 points down at 3044.46 . 
Uchumi supermarket has traded actively over the last few weeks following its financial report which showed a net profit increase of 23 percent for year ended June 30 , 1996 . 
some 1,009,675 shares of Uchumi were traded at 46.50 from 50 on Thursday while 100,102 shares of Kenya Airways were traded at 9.45 from 9.50 and Nation printers &amp; Publishers was traded at 105 from 106 . 
on average prices in most key shares eased marginally . 
&quot; The problem we have with our market right now is that there are too many speculators , &quot; a bourse official said . 
&quot; For example those ( investors ) who bought Kenya Airways shares at 11.25 felt they were cheated , especially those from upcountry . 
our agents went to some of them and found them ready to offload their shares immediately , &quot; she added . 
Kenya Airways was floated at 11.25 shillings per share early this year . 
after initial gains , it slid to present levels . 
but brokers were optimistic about the market . 
&quot; The time to get into the market is now . 
if you are looking to buy , you will get the best prices now , &quot; a senior broker said . 
&quot; We expect interest rates on treasury bills to come down , hopefully within six months , &quot; another broker said . 
&quot; Any investor buying now will be buying ahead of the market seeking to make a profit when prices go up . 
in the agriculturals , only REA Vipingo plantations and Sasini Tea &amp; Coffee were traded ; at 10.10 from 10.20 and an unchanged 53 respectively . 
&quot; I &apos;m always on bid looking for agriculturals at the moment , but they are so scarce , &quot; a broker said . 
brokers said the shares are very illiquid at the moment and most shareholders are not selling because the prices were too low for them to make a good return on their investment .
