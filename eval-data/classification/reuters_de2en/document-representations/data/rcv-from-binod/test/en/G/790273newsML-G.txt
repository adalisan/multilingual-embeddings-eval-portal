a federal judge denied a request by anti-nuclear groups to halt the U.S. government &apos;s $ 40 billion program for maintaining and modernizing its nuclear arsenal , the groups said on Monday . 
the groups had sought to block underground nuclear materials tests which the Energy Department resumed last month and other lab work which the government said is needed to keep weapons ready without violating an international ban on test explosions . 
&quot; We regret that Judge ( Stanley ) Sporkin did not issue a preliminary injunction , which would have immediately suspended these activities pending resolution of the case , &quot; the groups , including Greenpeace , Natural Resources Defense Council , and Peace Action , said in a statement . 
&quot; We shall continue to oppose the wasteful , provocative and environmentally dangerous stockpile steward and Management program in every possible venue , &quot; they said . 
the lawsuit said the Energy Department failed to evaluate the environmental effects of its program to manage radioactive wastes from the tests , and failed to look at alternatives to its costly plan for maintaining its weapons . 
in response to the request to suspend the program , U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ordered the Energy Department to disclose more information about its plutonium pit remanufacturing plans , its National ignition Facility and alternatives to the stockpile management program . 
the case now goes to a full hearing of the issues . 
the Energy Department said it was pleased with the decision , which will allow it to &quot; proceed as planned &quot; with its weapons maintenance program . 
&quot; As we had agreed during oral arguments , the department will provide additional environmental information and we look forward to doing so , &quot; an Energy Department spokeswoman said .
