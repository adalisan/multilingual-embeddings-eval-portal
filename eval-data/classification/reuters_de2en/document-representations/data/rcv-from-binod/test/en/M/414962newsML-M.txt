U.S. crude prices were expected to come under renewed pressure this week , with cash markets confronted by ever-increasing supplies of oil on world markets and futures trapped in a moderately bearish technical trend , traders said . 
cash markets have been swamped with crude in recent weeks , specifically sour crudes on offer for the U.S. Gulf from American companies lifting Iraqi crude under the U.N. oil-for-food deal . 
Iraqi cargoes held by Bayoil and Coastal Corp for April delivery have been shunned by a market overloaded with Canadian , West Coast and Latin American supply , traders said . 
now , the outlook for sweet grades has taken a bearish turn , amid rumors of large shipments of North Sea Brent to the Gulf Coast . 
talk in the market had Swiss-based Glencore fixing two ultra Large crude Carriers , one bound for the U.S. and one bound for South Africa , putting a total of just under three million barrels of Brent cargoes on the water for the U.S. and about 2.5 million barrels headed for South Africa . 
James ) down . 
people can &apos;t figure how they &apos;re ( Glencore ) going to make any money off this with Brent on offer in the Gulf at April Brent minus 30 cents , &quot; said a trader . 
the confusion on how money could be made on the shipment to the U.S. led other traders to question the chances for any of the oil appearing . 
West African barrels have already cheapened the market considerably , traders noted . 
on Monday , the April LLS was talked at only a 10-20 cents premium to the West Texas Intermediate / Cushing from a more than 45 cents premium last Monday . 
differentials for the key sour grade , West Texas sour / Midland were expected to continue a downward path . 
&quot; The sour just keeps on getting weaker . 
it could be headed for the $ 2.70 level ( discount to the WTI / Cushing ) , &quot; said a Texas trader . 
outright prices have lost at least one supportive feature with the announcement of a Labor settlement in Nigeria . 
workers at Nigeria &apos;s Department of Petroleum Resources , which oversees crude exports , agreed to a deal on Monday , alleviating strike fears . 
traders said the immediate feature in the NYMEX market is the continued testing of new lows , with the outright April contract slipping Monday to a new seven-week trough . 
&quot; technically , nothing has changed . 
the pressure is still on . 
I don &apos;t know where it will stop , but there have been no signs of a reversal yet , &quot; said Tom Bentz , head of energy trading at ING derivative in New York . 
April futures currently stood at $ 20.20-25 a barrel . 
other factors under market watch were developments at the United Nations concerning Iraq . 
diplomats said the normal 60-day sanctions review on Monday would certainly be continued . 
Iraq admitted to U.N. inspectors that at one time it bought 3,800 kilograms of nerve gas . 
inspectors have not verified where the gas is now , and if it has been destroyed . 
the oil deal continued to attract interest from oil companies , with more submissions for contracts under review by the U.N.-appointed overseers .
