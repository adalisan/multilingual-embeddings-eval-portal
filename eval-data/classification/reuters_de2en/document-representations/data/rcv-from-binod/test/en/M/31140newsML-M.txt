oil prices briefly hit post-Gulf War highs on Tuesday after the United States launched missiles against Iraqi defence targets in retaliation for military incursions into the Kurdish safe haven in northern Iraq . 
October futures for international benchmark Brent blend shot to $ 23.50 a barrel in Singapore , the highest oil price since shortly after Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait six years ago . 
but Brent later came back to earth as it became clear there was no threat to Middle East oil supplies outside the loss of imminent Iraqi sales under a U.N. exchange for food . 
Brent closed in London at $ 22.20 a barrel , up 22 cents , after gains of $ 1.21 on Monday . 
&quot; The fear is that Middle Eastern supplies might be disrupted ( but ) oil supply is not at significant risk at present , &quot; brokerage Gerald and National Inter commodities said . 
oil traders had been expecting Iraq in the next few weeks to make its first oil sale on world markets since Gulf War sanctions were imposed six years ago . 
but an oil-for-food deal signed in May was suspended by the United Nations on Sunday because of fears for the safety of U.N. aid distribution monitors in Iraq . 
the pact would allow Iraq to sell $ 2 billion worth of crude over six months , about 550,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) at current prices , to purchase humanitarian aid for its people . 
but Iraqi President Saddam Hussein &apos;s latest military adventure had probably derailed the plans for the resumption of Iraqi oil exports beyond the end of the year , oil analysts said . 
U.S. envoy to the United Nations Edward Gnehm said the terms of the oil-for-food pact now must be reopened . 
the eventual timing of Iraqi exports would depend on Baghdad , but could take &quot; months and months &quot; , Gnhem said . 
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said it would be &quot; some time &quot; before Iraqi exports could be considered again . 
&quot; This could delay the oil sale indefinitely because the U.N. can argue they cannot guarantee the safety of the food distributors , &quot; said Swiss bank UBS energy analyst Geoff Pyne . 
&quot; Perhaps Saddam thought he had nothing to gain by the oil sale so he took a gamble , &quot; said Pyne . 
&quot; Iraqi oil is not on the agenda until after the U.S. election ( in November ) , &quot; analyst Charles Gray at London brokerage prudential Bache said . 
U.S. defence officials said cruise missiles were fired at military and communications targets in southern Iraq . 
Washington extended a &quot; no-fly zone &quot; over safe havens in northern and southern Iraq . 
&quot; We &apos;re going through a Gulf War instant replay , &quot; prudential Bache &apos;s Gray said . 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said Baghdad would complete a withdrawal of troops from Kurdistan later on Tuesday . 
but Saddam declared Western safe havens in Iraq null and void and told his forces to fight back . 
delays to the oil sale came when crude , at $ 20 for Brent , was already $ 4 in advance of the same time last year , helped by Middle East tensions and low inventories in the West . 
&quot; It &apos;s not just missiles that are propelling this market higher , it &apos;s panic buying on ( petroleum ) products , &quot; prudential Bache &apos;s Gray said . 
&quot; Those people who thought they would be bailed out by Iraqi oil are now having to rethink things . 
tensions in the region were already high after a truck bomb in Saudi Arabia killed 19 Americans at a military complex in June . 
Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden , said to have influenced the Saudi nationals who carried out the attack , called last week for a holy war against U.S. troops in the region .
