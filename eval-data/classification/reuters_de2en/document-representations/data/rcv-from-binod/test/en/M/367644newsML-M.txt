the New York-based International Swaps and Derivatives Association said on Monday it was making efforts to incorporate the growing European energy swaps market into its umbrella group . 
ISDA officials will meet on Tuesday at a new London office to discuss with industry participants ways to include energy derivatives in ISDA &apos;s master agreements , Matthew Elderfield , director of European policy at ISDA , told a conference which opened on Monday . 
the trade group met last Thursday in New York and decided to change ISDA &apos;s guidelines by updating the definition of commodities , boosting the number of price sources and addressing certain legal issues , Elderfield said . 
he said the group in Europe was attempting to &quot; incorporate energy derivatives more directly into the framework of ISDA . 
ISDA planned to be more proactive on policy issues in Europe , including European monetary union , he said . 
ISDA is a worldwide trade association which promotes trading and swaps and has an advisory role on regulatory matters .
