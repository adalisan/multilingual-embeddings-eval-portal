two demonstrators died on Monday in street battles with riot police in the southern Albanian port of Vlore , one of a bullet wound , the other of a heart attack , hospital staff said . 
the casualties brought to three the number of dead in two days of clashes pitting anti-government protesters against police . 
a duty nurse at Vlore hospital said a 30-year-old demonstrator had suffered a bullet wound extending from the shoulder to the spine and died after an operation and large blood transfusions . 
the second victim , a man of 51 , died of heart failure before reaching hospital . 
twenty-six people , both police and protesters , remained in hospital with various injuries , the nurse said . 
fifty had been released after treatment . 
State television said eight injured policemen had been taken for further treatment to the capital Tirana , 140 km ( 80 miles ) to the north . 
ambulances raced through the town after a morning of pitched battles in which demonstrators cornered policemen and forced them to retreat into surrounding hills . 
they later advanced to the police station and erected street barricades . 
one man died in the first clashes which erupted on Sunday evening , when protesters threw stones at the police station and police fired back into the air . 
officials said he died of a heart attack , but demonstrators blamed the police for his death .
