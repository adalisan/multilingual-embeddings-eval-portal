minor metals trading was largely subdued during the past week and prices generally showed little movement following the annual London metals Week . 
antimony remained under downside pressure , while both Russian and high grade cobalt material held steady despite talk that a player was trying to push prices lower . 
the major European trader is looking for the cobalt to move lower in order to cover a short position , traders said . 
&quot; They are looking for cheaper buying opportunities , &quot; one commented . 
this factor may see a cobalt decline , though robust near-term demand from the aerospace and battery industries is likely to prompt a swift recovery . 
although supply is expected to outweigh demand towards the end of the 1990s several traders were quick to point out that supplies will remain tight in 1997 . 
&quot; Consumers will have to cover for 1997 and there is little metal available to the market , &quot; one trader said . 
Chinese offers and a lack of buying interest kept antimony on the defensive and some traders believed prices could still fall further towards $ 2,000 a tonne near term . 
magnesium in all its forms is expected to climb over the coming months . 
traders said they expected Ukrainian production to fall in 1997 , while one major Russian producer is believed to have signed a contract for a third of their annual capacity . 
also there is talk that most Chinese metal has already been allocated . 
&quot; The market is becoming tight which is likely to spark a recovery in prices , &quot; one trader said . 
rhodium after recent investment fund selling looked to be recovering its poise as buyers looked to be attracted by the lower levels . 
germanium was at a standstill as consumers held off , although traders noted some Japanese interest . 
the Japanese were also showing some interest in indium and were expected to cover soon . 
freely available metal was scarce , traders said . 
elsewhere , producer selling kept a cap on the bismuth market . 
traders noted that the dla was offering about 300,000 lbs of bismuth in fiscal year 1997 , with the initial offering to be held on October 23 .
