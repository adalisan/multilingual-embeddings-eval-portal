Simpson , testifying in his civil trial on Monday , was confronted with a letter written by his ex-wife in which she said she stopped loving him on Jan . 1 , 1989 , when he allegedly beat her . 
Nicole Brown Simpson also wrote in the undated letter , &quot; I &apos;d like you to keep this letter if we split so you will always know why we split . 
of the 1989 incident she wrote : &quot; I have never loved you since . 
asked about that by Daniel Petrocelli , the plaintiffs &apos; lead attorney in the case , Simpson replied , &quot; She told me just the opposite . 
Simpson said his ex-wife told him her lawyers &quot; had her write up various things for our divorce , but she would not testify to them , in her deposition or in court . 
&quot; The two divorced in 1992 . 
after being asked by his defence attorney , Robert Baker , &quot; On June 12 , 1994 , did you , with your children at home upstairs , murder your ex-wife and leave her body there for the kids to find ? 
&quot; and firmly answering , &quot; Absolutely not , &quot; Simpson ended his testimony after one-and-a-half days on the witness stand . 
in arguing that the letter and Nicole Brown Simpson &apos;s diary be admitted in evidence during his cross-examination of Simpson , Petrocelli told Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki that in the diary entry referring to the alleged beating she wrote , &quot; He beat the holy hell out of me . 
&quot; The judge allowed the items in to show Nicole Brown Simpson &apos;s state of mind . 
later Petrocelli confronted Simpson with several new photographs of the ex-football player at a buffalo Bills game in 1993 in which he is apparently wearing Bruno Magli designer shoes similar to ones FBI experts say left a bloody footprint at the murder scene . 
Simpson denied ever owning such shoes and told Petrocelli that he didn &apos;t think the pants he was wearing in the pictore were authentic either . 
&quot; I &apos;m normally a pretty sharp dresser and they ( pants ) don &apos;t look like me . 
they don &apos;t look like they fit , &quot; Simpson said . 
his defence has argued that a previous photo of Simpson at the game and apparently wearing such shoes , was doctored . 
Petrocelli then told him : &quot; You lied to this jury when you said you weren &apos;t wearing those shoes , didn &apos;t you ? 
&quot; Simpson said &quot; No . 
earlier Simpson told Baker he contemplated suicide during the famous slow-speed freeway chase on the day he was due to surrender to police and was charged with the June 12 , 1994 , murders of his ex-wife and her friend Ronald Goldman . 
Simpson , who was acquitted of the murders by a criminal court jury in October 1995 and is now battling a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the families of the victims , choked up at one point during Monday &apos;s testimony when he described asking police in a telephone call from his Chicago hotel room if his young children , Sydney and Justin , were safe . 
&quot; I wanted to know if my kids had been exposed to anything and he ( det . 
Ron Phillips ) said &apos; No , &apos; that they had been taken out the back ( of Nicole Brown Simpson &apos;s condominium ) and they didn &apos;t see anything , &quot; Simpson said in a breaking voice . 
the two victims were stabbed and slashed to death on the front walkway of the condominium . 
Simpson , losing his composure for the first time in nearly four days on the witness stand , including two-and-a-half days in November , was given a glass of water and breathed deeply before continuing . 
he said Phillips had told him his ex-wife had been murdered and he learned there was a second victim from his eldest daughter from a previous marriage , Arnelle . 
talking about visiting his ex-wife &apos;s grave on June 17 , when he was supposed to surrender , he said he was driven to the cemetery south of Los Angeles by his close friend , Al &quot; A.C. &quot; Cowlings , but they were unable to get to the gravesite because a police car was parked at the entrance . 
he said the two sat in a nearby orange grove and he got in the back seat of the car and took out a gun . 
asked why he did not go through with killing himself , he replied , &quot; A.C. , and my mom told me years ago that you can &apos;t go to heaven if you commit suicide and I was dealing with that , and thank God for A.C. &quot; 
the defence was expected to rest its case on Tuesday .
