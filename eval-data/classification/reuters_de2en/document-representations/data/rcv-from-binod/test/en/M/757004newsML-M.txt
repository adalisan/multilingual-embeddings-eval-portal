the slowly depreciating Taiwan dollar eased to yet another eight-year low close against its U.S. counterpart on Friday , reflecting the strength of the American currency overseas , dealers said . 
the local unit has not closed lower since finishing at T $ 28.03 on January 7 , 1989 . 
&quot; Since the U.S. dollar is hitting new highs against the German mark overseas , investors have been actively testing the Taiwan dollar &apos;s downside support today , &quot; said one dealer . 
dealers said they did not see apparent central bank intervention on Friday to defend the local currency . 
&quot; Probably because the ( Taiwan dollar ) fall was reflecting the overseas trend , the central bank was not seen to intervene to smooth the drepreciation , &quot; the dealer said .
