the United Nations refugee agency warned on Friday of a possible humanitarian catastrophe in eastern Zaire , where more fighting has cut food supplies to a trickle and virtually halted repatriation of Rwandan refugees . 
Sadako Ogata , U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees , is deeply concerned about the fate of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees in the area and is holding urgent talks with local authorities , spokeswoman Pamela O &apos;Toole said . 
she quoted Dillah Doumaye , UNHCR &apos;s deputy head of mission for Zaire just returned from the town of Kisangani , as saying : &quot; We have not yet reached a humanitarian catastrophe . 
&quot; However , the situation is extremely precarious and if things do not improve , we will head towards a humanitarian disaster , &quot; Doumaye added . 
the Geneva-based agency voiced concern over persistant reports of rebel soldiers in eastern Zaire arbitrarily shooting or arresting Rwandan refugees as they emerged from forests . 
o &apos;Toole rejected charges by Amnesty International that UNHCR was betraying its founding principles by encouraging the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of refugees in central Africa . 
&quot; We don &apos;t agree with their assessment that we have abandoned our protection mandate . 
that is simply not true , &quot; she said . 
&quot; The problem is this is not a textbook repatriation ... We are under fire from all sides whatever we do at the moment . 
Amnesty said in a report on Friday that UNHCR &quot; legitimised &quot; deportations by ignoring questions over the returnees &apos; safety , and whether they were going back of their own free will . 
half a million Rwandan Hutus in Tanzania were expelled by troops in December . 
they followed the return from east Zaire of 600,000 Rwandan Hutus and 60,000 Burundian Hutus after rebels overran their camps . 
in eastern Zaire , only a trickle of food is reaching Rwandan refugees in camps at Tingi-Tingi ( 120,000 ) , Amisi ( 40,000 ) and the most isolated camp at Shabunda ( 30-40,000 ) , UNHCR said . 
&quot; The area is already a logistical nightmare -- although we and other agencies have been doing our best , it is simply not possible to get enough supplies in , &quot; O &apos;Toole said . 
Marie Heuze , a UNICEF spokeswoman , told the same briefing that authorities had confirmed 105 cholera cases in Tingi-Tingi on Wednesday . 
the outbreak has caused three deaths . 
an average of 10 children under age five are dying each day in eastern Zaire , mainly from diarrhoea , according to UNICEF . 
the UNHCR was still looking at ways to provide &quot; safe areas &quot; further west for the refugees or open up humanitarian corridors to allow them to return to Rwanda , according to O &apos;Toole . 
but she conceded : &quot; The situation does not look particularly bright . 
the fighting makes it difficult . 
asked about UNHCR &apos;s intention announced last week to airlift the most vulnerable refugees home , including women and children , she said : &quot; We have not abandoned it . 
but we &apos;ve run into trouble . 
&quot; There are many problems in the area , logistics and now fighting , &quot; she added . 
&quot; We &apos;ve run into problems with one element within the government . 
we are still pressing ahead .
