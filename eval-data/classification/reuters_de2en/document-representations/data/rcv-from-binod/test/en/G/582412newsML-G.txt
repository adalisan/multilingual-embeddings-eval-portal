opposition MPs used the opportunity of a debate on a parliamentary committee report into allegations of assault by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters to challenge the panel &apos;s findings . 
in a debate set to take up most of the morning , leftwing Alliance leader Jim Anderton , who laid the original complaint to the privileges committee , called on his fellow MPs to reject the committee &apos;s finding that Peters was not guilty of contempt . 
Anderton said the Comittee had erred by concluding that , while Peters had probably assaulted National MP John Banks , he had not comitted a contempt of the house on technical grounds . 
Anderton , who witnessed the incident in the house late in the evening of March 5 , moved the report be amended to find Peters guilty of contempt of parliament . 
Anderton also moved that Peters be required to apologise to parliament and then absent himself from the house for a day in recognition of his contempt . 
one political observer , speaking on Radio New Zealand , noted that the New Zealand parliament had never gone as far as to overturn a committee report &apos;s conclusions . 
although Peters was present in the chamber , he had not initially made any comment by 11.30 a.m. ( 2300 GMT ) and it was not clear whether he was planning to apologise to the house , as he has been asked to do by the committee . 
another MP , free-market ACT party leader Richard Prebble , also questioned the credibility of the events and the two men involved in the fracas , which took place after a late night debate on taxation . 
Prebble challenged Banks to tell Parliament if he believed the assault was linked to events in the house , which , if proven , would have made Peters guilty of contempt . 
&quot; If he has any view in his mind that he was assaulted in order to stop him carrying out his duties as a member of Parliament , then he had a duty to tell that to the privileges committee and a duty to tell it to the House , &quot; he said . 
Michael Cullen , deputy leader of the largest opposition party , Labour , said he believed that what Peters did had been related to events in the house . 
&quot; But it may not have been appropriate to push for that to be the committee &apos;s conclusion , &quot; he said in a press statement issued ahead of the debate .
