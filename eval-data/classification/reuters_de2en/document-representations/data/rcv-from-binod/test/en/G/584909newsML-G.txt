a Jordanian taxi driver shot dead his wife and four young children because he believed she was unfaithful and suspected the children were not his , the Jordan Times newspaper said on Wednesday . 
it said 40-year-old Awad M. turned himself over to police in Jordan &apos;s southern province of Karak on Tuesday after shooting the children , aged between four months and seven years old , and their mother Samar Salah , 35 . 
the paper quoted an official source as saying Awad told police he acted to &quot; cleanse his honour &quot; after a strange man , who he suspected was having an affair with his wife , knocked at his door late at night and fled when he answered . 
Awad &apos;s relatives said he was in serious debt and he shot his family because of financial problems , the paper added . 
the children were all shot in the head . 
one , who tried to hide from his father , was found dead under his bed . 
Salah had a bullet wound in the chest , it said . 
the paper said two other children had survived . 
Rasha , four , was found alive by neighbours after she was shot and was rushed to hospital . 
Nermeen , eight , escaped her father &apos;s wrath by hiding in a bedroom closet . 
&quot; Honour killings &quot; of women suspected of infidelity or premarital affairs are not uncommon in Jordan and perpetrators often receive relatively light prison terms . 
the paper quoted a pathologist as saying paternity tests would be carried out on the dead children .
