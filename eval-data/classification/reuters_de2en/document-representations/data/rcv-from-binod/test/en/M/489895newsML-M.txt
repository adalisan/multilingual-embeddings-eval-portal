Dubai &apos;s shopping festival is fueling a healthy appetite for retail gold but bargain jewellery and gold coins are in tough competition with promotions of everything from Rolls Royces to BMWs , traders said on Sunday . 
&quot; The festival is going well but it &apos;s slower than last year . 
there are too many campaigns going on . 
there are too many offers on the market . 
it &apos;s healthy but it &apos;s not booming , &quot; said one . 
&quot; You can get a good deal everywhere . 
they are giving away Rolls Royces , BMWs and lots of other things , &quot; he added . 
backers of the Dubai shopping Festival ( DSF ) , which opened on March 27 , and its parallel &quot; Dubai city of gold &quot; promotion , have high hopes that the events will drive sales skywards , with an expected two million visitors . 
tourists from the Indian-subcontinent and other Gulf Arab states are expected to empty their wallets in Dubai where jewellery-making costs and taxes are often lower than in other regional markets and close to spot market rates . 
another trader said tourists visiting the emirate of Dubai were spending most of their money on small purchases of jewellery . 
&quot; Small pieces of jewellery are doing fine but it will take another couple of months before demand for the Ten Tola to get stronger , &quot; he said . 
Dubai &apos;s benchmark Ten Tola ( TT ) bar -- 3.746 ounces of 24 carat gold -- was quoted by traders at 4,825 UAE dirhams ( $ 1,314 ) on Sunday , down from 4,835-4,840 dirhams on March 30 . 
spot gold was last quoted on Saturday at $ 348.70- $ 349.20 an ounce , down from $ 349.50- $ 350.00 a week earlier . 
traders said re-export demand into India -- the major market for Dubai gold -- was low . 
&quot; Demand to India is subdued because there are no major festivals at the moment , &quot; said one . 
but an anticipated revival of wedding season demand for gold from mid-April would strengthen the market , traders said . 
market prospects in the Gulf seemed bright with demand expected to rise in Saudi Arabia with the approaching annual Haj pilgrimage of some two million Moslems to Islamic holy sites in the kingdom , traders said .
