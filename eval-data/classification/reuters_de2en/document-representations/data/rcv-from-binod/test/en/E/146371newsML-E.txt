savings from lower-than-expected interest rates will enable the government to cut a maximum one trillion lire from Italy &apos;s proposed &quot; Euro Tax &quot; bill , a Treasury official said . 
the one-off tax , which in effect will be made up of a number of fiscal measures , was included in the government &apos;s 1997 budget package and was designed to raise 12.5 trillion lire . 
but a parliamentary budget commission on Friday introduced a new wording for the tax which will allow the government to use savings from lower debt servicing costs to cushion the impact of the fiscal tightening . 
a Treasury official said between 500 billion to one trillion lire of savings could be re-routed to support the Euro Tax . 
&quot; No more , &quot; he said . 
newspapers speculated at the weekend that the government would use some two to three trillion lire of revenues saved by lower-than-expected interest payable on state bills and floating certificates to cushion the Euro Tax . 
the Bank of Italy cut its official discount rate to 7.5 percent last week from a previous 8.25 percent but it is not yet clear what savings the government can expect next year from any subsequent fall in debt yields . 
Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi told reporters on Saturday that government budget caluculations would not take into account any fall in interest rates , but added that &quot; improving financial conditions &quot; would help economic policy . 
the government has not yet explained what the Euro Tax will touch , but Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco said in a statement at the weekend that all Italians would be asked to help out . 
&quot; Its weight will be in relation to everyone &apos;s capacity to pay , &quot; he said , adding that it would &quot; scrupulously avoid &quot; hurting production activity and inflation . 
the Euro Tax is designed to cut Italy &apos;s 1997 deficit and enable the country to be a founder member of the planned single European currency . 
Italy &apos;s draft 1997 budget is currently being examined at commission stage in parliament and will be submitted to the full lower house on October 30 with a final vote due by November 14 . 
it will then pass to the upper house for debate .
