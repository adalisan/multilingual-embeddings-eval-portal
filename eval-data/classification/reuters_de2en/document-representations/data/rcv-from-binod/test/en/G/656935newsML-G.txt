U.N. chief Kofi Annan , warning that peace and democracy in West Africa are fragile , said on Thursday that &quot; free , fair and credible elections &quot; next month in Liberia were the next crucial step to restoring the rule of law . 
Annan also called for reversing the &quot; illegitimate , misguided grab for power &quot; by coup leaders in Sierra Leone &quot; peacefully , if at all possible &quot; . 
Annan sent his message from U.N. headquarters in New York to a ministerial meeting in Geneva of the Special Conference to Support the Peace Process in Liberia . 
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi reported to the meeting on developments in the peace process and prospects for the July 19 poll there . 
diplomats noted the irony of Ikimi taking part in the talks on Liberia &apos;s elections on the fourth anniversary of an annulled presidential poll in his country . 
participants , who discussed stalled funding of the election , included member countries of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , donor countries and other U.N. bodies assisting the peace process . 
foreign ministers of Liberia , Ivory Coast , Burkina Fasso and Zimbabwe were among those attending . 
&quot; We have all been reminded in these last few weeks of the fragility of peace and democracy in West Africa , &quot; Annan said , referring to a May 25 coup in Sierra Leone . 
&quot; I have just returned from the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) summit in Harare and I can report that Africa is speaking with one voice in support of democracy and against the rule of the gun , &quot; the Ghanaian added . 
the one-day ministerial meeting , being chaired by Ibrahima Fall , assistant U.N. secretary-general for political affairs , was the third since last November . 
&quot; Your Conference signals the determination to restore lasting security and the rule of law to Liberia , &quot; Annan said . 
&quot; Free , fair and credible elections are the next crucial step in this process . 
&quot; If we succeed -- as I am confident we will -- Liberia can become a model of post-conflict reconstruction involving national leaders , regional organisations and the United Nations . 
&quot; The hopes of the continent are with you , &quot; Annan said .
