the value of Venezuela &apos;s basket of crude oil and refined products was stable over the past week , rising just three cents to $ 14.98 per barrel on Friday , the Energy and Mines Ministry said on Friday . 
world oil prices have hardly budged above the 13-month low they hit last week . 
traders in the price-setting futures market in New York said they were reluctant to take out new positions ahead of the Organisation for Petroleum exporting Countries ( OPEC ) ministerial meeting next Wednesday . 
poor demand for and record high production of gasoline in the key United States market was the main reason for the recent price slide , they added . 
the average basket price for the month of June so far was $ 15.65 per barrel , down five cents from last week , and 79 cents below May . 
prices have been falling steadily for all of this year , since they peaked at the end of 1996 at $ 21.55 per barrel , a multi-year high . 
the basket closed that year with one of the highest average prices for several years at $ 18.39 per barrel , against $ 14.84 for 1995 . 
in 1997 so far , the basket averaged $ 16.97 per barrel , down 14 cents from last week , the Ministry figures showed . 
Venezuela &apos;s government based its 1997 budget on an average price for the year of $ 14.40 per barrel , although Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta has said he expects it to average higher than $ 15.50 . 
the government has based its 1998 budget on an average price of $ 15.50 per barrel .
