the president of Bundesliga side Duisburg , Dieter Fischdick , died on Thursday after suffering a heart attack at a news conference . 
the businessman collapsed at the media event to preview his club &apos;s match with champions Dortmund this weekend . 
he was 58 . 
Fischdick served as club president for eight years , taking the helm when they were playing regional league soccer and bringing them up to Bundesliga standard . 
but he recently announced his intention to quit the post after he was harshly criticised by some fans and members over his plans to reform Duisburg &apos;s organisation . 
coach Friedhelm Funkel and the playing staff had tried to make him change his mind and had dedicated the side &apos;s first home victory of the season , a 3-2 win over Werder Bremen last month , to Fischdick . 
&quot; We &apos;ve lost someone who deserved the greatest respect . 
Duisburg , who were promoted to the Bundesliga last season , lie fourth from bottom of the table , just above the relegation zone .
