the U.S. Treasury market begins its quietest stretch of the year on Monday , amid a dearth of economic news and players concentrating more on Christmas than bond positions . 
&quot; All there will be is window dressing and positioning for year-end , &quot; said Michelle Colley Laughlin , chief market strategist at prudential Securities Inc , who , like the majority of Wall Street , will be on vacation . 
as such , market participants anticipate narrow-range trading during the 3-1 / 2 days that the market is open . 
the market is slated to close at 1400 est / 1900 GMT on Tuesday for Christmas Eve , and remain closed on Christmas Day , Wednesday . 
&quot; Starting after ( Friday ) participation becomes limited for the next two weeks and we won &apos;t be at a full staffing situation for two weeks , &quot; said Brett Benza , senior trader at Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
&quot; Next week , not only will participation be limited , but information will be limited , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There is no important economic news until January 10 , &quot; when the December employment report will be released . 
Monday , the Commerce Department is slated to release November personal income and spending data . 
weekly jobless claims are due on Thursday , and November durable goods figures will be issues Friday . 
players said the market will very likely ignore the data . 
&quot; We will just trade around these ( current ) levels , &quot; Laughlin said . 
on Friday , the benchmark 30-year bond ended at 98-20 / 32 , down 8 / 32 , to yield 6.61 percent . 
the 10-year note was down 7 / 32 to 101 even , yielding 6.36 percent . 
players said it was hard to tell which direction the market was headed . 
but much depends on news being released this Friday -- the minutes from the November Federal Open Market Committee meeting . 
some noted that since the minutes come out at the close of trade , the reaction will wait until Monday , after the press and analysts have had a chance to dissect it . 
the market is mainly looking to see if the tightening bias is still in place and if Minneapolis Fed president Gary Stern dissented yet again . 
the danger in a thin week , market participants said , is that a thin trading environment is susceptible to sharp price swings and exaggerated price action . 
but with little key economic news , that is unlikely . 
yet , the following week -- when the National Association of Purchasing Management survey and auto sales are due -- could see big price moves , players said .
