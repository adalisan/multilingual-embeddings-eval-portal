right-winger Arnoldo Aleman took a comfortable early lead on Monday in Nicaragua &apos;s presidential elections , dealing a major blow to former Sandinista ruler Daniel Ortega who had fought fiercely to return to power . 
first official results with 2.58 percent of the votes counted gave Aleman , ex-mayor of Managua and a vehement anti- Sandinista , 49.83 percent of the vote , compared with 40 percent for Ortega . 
though the voting sample was small , electoral authorities indicated it was enough to suggest an early trend . 
a victory above 45 percent would spare Aleman and his Liberal Alliance party from a second round run-off , and his supporters were already celebrating triumph before the first results were announced . 
&quot; Now is the time for the really liberating revolution , the Liberal revolution , &quot; said an exuberant supporter , Gilberto Montenegro , celebrating what he saw as the the end of the Sandinista &apos;s hard-fought bid to regain the presidency . 
both sides have demonised each other during the campaign , the Sandinistas playing up Aleman &apos;s links to backers of late ex-dictator Anastasio Somoza and Aleman smearing Ortega as a closet Marxist thinly disguised as a social democrat . 
the ugly campaign reignited the smouldering right-left political divide in Nicaragua , and raised fears of conflict . 
at Sandinista headquarters , visibly worried officials sought to put a brave face on the early results , saying the voting sample was small enough that the final outcome could still go either way . 
they also strongly appealed for calm from their own supporters and the rival camp . 
&quot; We &apos;ve asked our fellow Sandinistas to remain calm , it &apos;s still very premature to say that someone won or lost . 
we ask the Liberal Alliance to display the same calm , to not yet indulge in triumphalist speeches , &quot; Ortega &apos;s campaign manager Alvaro Fiallos told reporters . 
eager for Aleman to proclaim victory , his supporters danced salsa and feted each other rowdily during a post-election patio party at the burly lawyer &apos;s headquarters . 
&quot; This means peace , progress and well-being for all Nicaraguans , including the Sandinistas who are also Nicaraguans , &quot; said Aleman &apos;s campaign chief Jorge Salaverry , holding out an olive branch of sorts . 
the revolutionary Sandinistas overthrew Somoza in 1979 , fought U.S.-backed contra rebels and governed the country for 11 years before losing power in an election to current centrist President Violeta Chamorro in 1990 .
