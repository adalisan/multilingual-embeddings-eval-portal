Turkey &apos;s Islamist-led government suffered another series of body blows on Friday , pushing it closer to collapse after months of political gridlock . 
a secularist cabinet member resigned , citing what he said were government Islamist leanings at odds with Turkey &apos;s decades-old tradition of keeping party politics out of the mosque . 
and a far-right powerbroker refused a government invitation to form a broader coalition to ward off an anti-Islamist campaign by the secularist army . 
analysts said President Suleyman Demirel , who usually stays out of party politics , might have to step in . 
&quot; We look like we &apos;re heading for a Demirel-appointed technocrat government in the summer and elections by the autumn , &quot; said a senior Western diplomat . 
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan , modern Turkey &apos;s first Islamist leader , has said he would step down in favour of his conservative coalition partner Tansu Ciller by the end of this month and go for snap polls . 
no date has been fixed for early elections , but on Friday leading Islamist deputy Salih Kapusuz told reporters that he saw no problem with the handover of the prime minister &apos;s post to Ciller by June 18 . 
a senior MP from her True Path Party said late on Thursday an announcement would be made on June 17 on the handover of power to Ciller , who previously served as Turkey &apos;s first woman prime minister . 
the handover and polls would have to be approved by the president and parliament , where Erbakan lacks a clear majority . 
Demirel , an avowed secularist , can block the planned power transfer , appoint a caretaker government and call polls himself if no viable coalition becomes apparent within 45 days of Erbakan &apos;s standing down . 
however , the president said it was too early for him to play an active role . 
&quot; The head of the government comes and hands me his resignation . 
after that , I go on the stage but not until then , &quot; Anatolian news agency quoted him as saying . 
tourism Minister Bahattin Yucel quit on Friday , becoming the fourth minister from Ciller &apos;s conservative True Path Party wing to ditch the coalition in two months . 
&quot; I felt that it went against my parliamentary oath to stay in power , with the contradictions to our country &apos;s values that were involved , &quot; Yucel told a news conference . 
Istanbul shares closed 2.7 percent down on the political uncertainty . 
the general index had dropped 5.72 percent at one point in mid-afternoon , a steep plunge even by the standards of Turkey &apos;s volatile market . 
NATO member Turkey has not had stable rule since a right-left coalition collapsed in 1995 . 
now , months of open criticism from the generals have brought the current alliance close to imploding . 
a right-winger who could hold the balance in parliament said he would not join a caretaker government proposed by Foreign Minister Ciller and Erbakan . 
&quot; We do not want to enter a government which is going to an election , &quot; Muhsin Yazicioglu , leader of the Grand Unity Party , said . 
he had been bargaining with the alliance to become a third coalition partner . 
bringing Yazicioglu and his seven MPs into the fold could have guaranteed the government success in pushing election legislation and Ciller &apos;s planned promotion through parliament . 
Erbakan has only has 274 MPs in the 550-seat assembly . 
two seats are vacant . 
generals have dubbed the Islamists Turkey &apos;s public enemy number one and have encouraged judicial crackdowns on illegal religious education classes .
