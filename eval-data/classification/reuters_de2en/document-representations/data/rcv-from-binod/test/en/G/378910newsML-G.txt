Firebrand Northern League leader Umberto Bossi prepared on Friday to rouse his party faithful with a call to cut links with southern Italy , but an opinion poll showed few Italians want to follow him . 
Bossi was gearing up to deliver an unequivocally separatist message in a weekend speech to a party congress . 
the first day of the congress , which formally opened in a Milan conference centre , was devoted to procedural matters while Bossi made final preparations in a mountain retreat for his appearance on Saturday . 
&quot; We now have to invent the procedures to carry out a secession , &quot; he told reporters . 
the Northern League , which rose to prominence on public disenchantment with political corruption , won 10.1 percent of the vote in general elections last April on a federalist platform fashioned to appeal to Italians in the affluent north . 
Bossi abruptly changed tack after the elections , which gave the League more votes than it had ever polled before but failed to give him the pivotal role in politics he sought . 
he ditched federalism and espoused the seperatist creed , but a declaration of independence for the movement &apos;s self-styled &quot; republic of Padania &quot; fell flat last September , suggesting he had completely misread the popular mood . 
an opinion poll published by the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera suggested that northern Italians had not warmed to Bossi &apos;s separatist agenda . 
the poll , conducted among 600 people in northern Italy , said 79.7 percent shared President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro &apos;s view that Italy was &quot; single and indivisible . 
it showed strong support for a federalist state , with 67.9 percent backing the idea . 
disturbingly for Bossi , nearly three quarters of those polled thought that he was not the right man to look after the north &apos;s interests . 
the League is forging ahead with plans to organise a referendum in April which will poll support in northern Italy for an independent Padania . 
Bossi continues to play on deep-seated resentment in the north , particularly among the self-employed , with high taxes , inefficient social services and a remote bureaucracy in Rome . 
three-quarters of those questioned for the poll believed that the League &apos;s anger with the political establishment in Rome was at least partly justified , suggesting that the League is still seen as an outlet for protest voters . 
Bossi has kept up a barrage of verbal tirades against politicians in Rome . 
asked by Corriere della Sera if he would invite officials of Italy &apos;s other major political parties to the three-day League congress , Bossi gave a typically scathing answer . 
&quot; invite the leaders of the other parties ? 
for the love of God , they are Italians , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If they were to come we would have to watch our wallets .
