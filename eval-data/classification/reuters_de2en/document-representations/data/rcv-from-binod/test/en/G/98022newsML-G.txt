Albert belle &apos;s seventh-inning grand slam snapped a tie and kept the Cleveland Indians alive in the American League division series with an 9-4 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Friday . 
the defending Al champion Indians , back home after losing the first two games in Baltimore , forced Game Four of the division series on Saturday in Cleveland . 
three teams have come back from 0-2 deficits to win best-of-five series , most recently last season , when the Seattle mariners rallied against the New York Yankees . 
after not hitting a ball out of the infield in his first six at-bats of the series , belle homered twice , walked twice and singled in his next six trips , reminding everyone he is still the most dangerous hitter in the game . 
Left-hander Jesse Orosco relieved starter Mike Mussina to open the seventh , promptly walked the bases loaded . 
Armando Benitez came on , and belle launched a 1-2 fastball deep over the left-centre field wall , breaking a 4-4 tie . 
it was the first post-season grand slam by an Indian since Elmer Smith hit one in the 1920 World Series . 
Manny Ramirez hit his second Homer of the series for Cleveland , which still has not had a solid performance from its starting pitchers . 
Right-hander Jack McDowell remained winless in four post-season appearances , allowing four runs and six hits in 5-2 / 3 innings . 
but the bullpen , which pitched poorly in Game Two , bounced back . 
Alan Embree retired B.J. 
Surhoff , who earlier hit his third Homer of the series , to end the sixth . 
in the seventh , Paul Shuey allowed a single and a walk but got Todd Zeile to bounce into a double play . 
after another walk , Paul Assenmacher got Rafael Palmeiro to fly out . 
Assenmacher got the win , Eric Plunk pitched a scoreless eighth and Jose Mesa worked the ninth .
