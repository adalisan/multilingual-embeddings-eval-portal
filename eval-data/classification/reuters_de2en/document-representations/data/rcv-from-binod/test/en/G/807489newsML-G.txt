Turkey &apos;s Islamist Welfare Party , fighting an attempt by the highest court to close it , has denied acting against the country &apos;s secularist constitution . 
&quot; To this day our party has done nothing and held no policy which was in conflict with the basic principles of the constitution , &quot; the party said in a lengthy document it gave to the constitutional court in its defence last week . 
the Islamists published the document , which forms the heart of their legal defence , on the Internet at the weekend . 
welfare , the biggest party in Turkey &apos;s parliament , faces being banned by the constitutional court on the grounds that it poses a threat to the constitution and 74-year-old tradition of secularism . 
welfare leader Necmettin Erbakan ruled Turkey for a year in coalition with conservatives until he resigned in June under pressure from the secularist establishment , led by the army . 
he was replaced by conservative Mesut Yilmaz , who leads a left-right coalition committed to a package of military-backed legal measures to limit radical Islam . 
the mostly Turkish-language website at http : / / www.rp.org.tr contains sections from the chief prosecutor &apos;s case for closing the party , as well as the full text of the Islamists &apos; defence . 
welfare cites Western human rights groups and international rights treaties as obstacles to outlawing a party . 
&quot; In modern democracies , parties that do not support terror and violence ... cannot and will not be closed , &quot; the party says . 
the Welfare website complains of a &quot; media bombardment with a misinformation campaign &quot; and says the Turkish media have given prominence to a leaked document of the prosecution case . 
the court is expected to announce a decision in the coming months after evaluating written submissions . 
it can also call witnesses . 
welfare received a blow at the weekend when parliament passed education reforms proposed by the government which will close many religious schools from which the party gains support .
