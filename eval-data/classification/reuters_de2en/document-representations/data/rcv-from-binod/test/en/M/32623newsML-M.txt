emerging market debt prices were confined to narrow ranges Wednesday as liquidity dried up ahead of the U.S. payrolls report on Friday , traders said . 
&quot; In Latins there is nothing going on except trading along with treasuries , &quot; one Brady bond trader said . 
&quot; Everyone is waiting until Friday . 
but the Brady market held on to its gains as the U.S. long bond closed 1 / 2 point lower to yield 7.10 percent . 
Brady traders also offered little reaction to confirmation that Argentine government was exploring options for issuing a 30-year bond , perhaps as a global bond . 
another financing option would be to reopen the 20 year 350 million mark Eurobond launched on Tuesday , an Argentine official said . 
Argentine FRBs picked up 1 / 4 for a bid price of 79 , while discounts were unchanged 69-1 / 8 . 
Walter Molano , director of Latin American Research at Swiss Bank , said he anticipated FRBs would maintain a strong bid tone as the stock of paper declines . 
&quot; They have been resilient to volatility in the region and in the country , &quot; Molano said . 
as countries develop their own capital markets and start buying back their Brady debt , the emerging debt markets would likely perform much more smoothly , Molano said . 
some Wall Street bankers may not be warming to the prospect of diminished Brady liquidity , but the trend of refinancing could only be positive for Argentina , said one analyst at a major U.S. pension fund . 
&quot; As trader you may not like it , but from a fundamental point of view it is definitely good news , &quot; the analyst said . 
&quot; The bottom line is that the country needs financing and the longer term financing it can raise the better , &quot; the analyst said . 
&quot; From a debt management point-of-view it would be the right thing to do .
