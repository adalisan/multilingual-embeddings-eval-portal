U.S. Midwest direct cash hogs sold $ 0.50 to $ 1.00 per cwt lower on Wednesday as cooler conditions sparked increased movement in some areas while demand remained sluggish , livestock dealers said . 
&quot; With the weather breaking , these plants are getting everything they need and then some . 
they are not having to do any chasing at all to get their hogs , &quot; one Indiana-based dealer said . 
in Iowa / Minnesota , early trade in the country was reported at $ 55.00 to $ 55.50 per cwt and to plants at $ 56.00 , down $ 0.50 to $ 1.00 from prices paid for similar hogs on Tuesday . 
&quot; We &apos;re getting a good run and demand isn &apos;t real good , &quot; one Minnesota dealer said . 
USDA reported a top in Iowa / southern Minnesota on Tuesday of $ 58.00 per cwt , a drop of $ 3.50 from a week earlier . 
&quot; They have torn this thing apart . 
there are more hogs moving and weights are a little above a year ago , &quot; one Ohio dealer said . 
USDA estimated the average weight of slaughter hogs in the U.S. for the week ended last Friday at 255 lbs , slightly down from 256 lb a week earlier but above 251 lbs a year earlier .
