German DAX index fell in early bourse trade on Friday , catching up on losses from electronic trade , as a lower close on Wall Street overnight and a touch of pre-weekend catharsis hit sentiment on the stock exchange . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen some profit-taking initially . 
volumes are quieter than they have been , we have got a little bit of stuff on , but this will probably pick up over the day , &quot; a trader said . 
the Dow Jones Industrial index fell 0.86 percent to 8,188 points overnight , which prompted early jitters among German share traders . 
&quot; Wall Street was the initial thing driving the market down . 
but this is a liquidity-driven market and it doesn &apos;t just go away overnight . 
it &apos;s healthy to have a bit of a sell-off , but I think we may yet have a bit of a rally this afternoon , &quot; a share trader said . 
the focus in early dealings was on financials , particularly the banks as takeover speculation continued with talk of a possible takeover by HSBC of Commerzbank . 
Commerzbank was leading volumes and trading ahead against the trend at 65.40 marks , up 1.95 marks or three percent . 
dealers said they did not give the talk much credence , but said the rumours were supporting interest in the bank , long identified as a top takeover candidate . 
dealers expected a sideways trend through the rest of the day , with the continued interest in financials seen preventing any major losses .
