the ruling UK Conservative party said it would set the date by next Monday for a by-election in Wirral South that could , if the seat falls to Labour , push Prime Minister John Major back into a minority in parliament . 
a spokesman reaffirmed a commitment by Conservative chairman Brian Mawhinney to move the writ for the by-election before the traditional three-month deadline on Monday , February 3 . 
that will mark exactly three months since the death of Conservative Barry Porter , who had a majority at the 1992 election of 8,163 . 
&quot; We will move the writ in the next week , &quot; the spokesman said . 
as a consequence , the by-election will take place either on February 20 , February 27 or March 6 , he added . 
the main opposition Labour party earlier threatened to force a by-election on February 27 unless the Conservatives moved the writ by next Monday . 
labour is keen to fight the by-election because it believes it can win the seat from the Conservatives , giving themselves in the process a solid platform for the general election . 
a MORI poll last week showed Labour leading the Conservatives in Wirral South by 52-36 percent , with the Liberal Democrats on 12 percent . 
if Labour captured the seat , a comfortable suburban area south of Liverpool , it and the other opposition parties combined would have 323 members of parliament compared with 322 Conservatives . 
labour &apos;s shadow Leader of the House of Commons , Ann Taylor , accused the Conservatives of dodging a fight . 
&quot; We are today issuing a challenge to the Conservatives to issue the writ for the by-election . 
if they fail to do so , we want to make it clear that the Labour party in parliament will move the writ to give the electorate of Wirral their chance to have their say on this government , &quot; she said .
