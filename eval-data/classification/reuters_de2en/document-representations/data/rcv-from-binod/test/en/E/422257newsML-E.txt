Australian Treasurer Peter Costello refused on Wednesday to speculate on whether official interest rates had bottomed , but said he did not think it was questioned that the economy is strengthening . 
asked a news confernece following the release of December quarter GDP data if he conceded , as financial markets had , that official rates had bottomed , Costello replied : &quot; Well they make their own decisions , that &apos;s what they get paid those high salaries for , &quot; he said . 
asked the question again , he said : &quot; I don &apos;t speculate on rates . 
he was then asked if the economy had bottomed . 
data released earlier showed GDP rose 0.5 percent in the December quarter to be 3.1 percent higher over the year . 
the Reserve Bank cut official interest rates by a total of 150 basis points to 6.0 percent over the second half of 1996 , but expectations of a fourth rate cut have been factored out of the market in recent weeks . 
in fact , the market now favours a tightening as the next move in rates , possibly as early as year end , following a run of strong partial indicators .
