a Moroccan think-tank said on Tuesday that it expected the country &apos;s Treasury deficit gap to widen in 1997 due to economic stagnation and drop of tax receipts . 
an expected drop in tax receipts and liberalisation of banking interest rates will push towards a widening gap of the deficit , the independent Centre Maorocain de Conjoncture ( CMC ) said but gave no figures . 
commenting on the forecast in a CMC newsletter to be released soon , a CMC analyst said : &quot; The financing of treasury deficit ... will face serious problems this year due mainly to the economy &apos;s stagnation and tax receipt drop . 
according to official provisional figures quoted by the centre , the Treasury deficit rose to 10.2 billion dirhams ( $ 1.09 billion ) in 1996 , from 9.4 billion dirhams in the previous year . 
in recent years receipts declined respectively to 69.6 billion dirhams in 1994 , 62.7 billion in 1995 but suddenly rose to 75.07 billion dirhams last year , the centre said . 
&quot; But our forecast is that the receipts should drop in 1997 because 1996 was an exceptional year , &quot; it added . 
to comply with the World Trade Organisation rules , Morocco is dismantling customs barriers , reducing taxes on companies and on exported goods , officials said . 
the centre also said that previously the Treasury had benefited from public financing at an interest rate of around 4.25 percent . 
&quot; But with the continuing financial reforms , the Treasury will be obliged to deal with the financial market &apos;s interest rate of up to 12 percent . 
the Treasury also benefited from an exceptional 6.0 billion dirhams state financial envelope to finance its deficit in 1995 which coincided with a severe drought and GDP negative growth of minus 7.6 percent , the expert said . 
in an earlier newsletter , the centre predicted : &quot; On the basis of the climate ... we expect a stagnation of Morocco &apos;s Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) in 1997 and probably a negative growth of minus one percent in the worst of cases , due mainly to an expected 50 percent drop in cereals harvest . 
agricultural activity represents nearly 20 percent of Morocco &apos;s GDP and employs 50 percent of the country &apos;s estimated 10 million workforce . 
GDP totalled $ 34.7 billion in 1996 against $ 31.8 billion in 1995 , the Statistics Directorate said .
