the Belgrade Stock Exchange ( BSE ) said on Monday its turnover soared 68.4 percent during the week ending November 22 , and traders attributed the surge to renewed buying of the central bank short-term bonds . 
total weekly turnover jumped to 33.99 million dinars ( $ 6.87 million ) from 20.182 million a week ago . 
the number of transactions rose to 173 from 149 , the bourse said . 
despite the rising turnover , traders said market liquidity was tight , resulting in greater demand for fresh borrowing . 
&quot; Most of the activity is based on revolving old borrowing . 
demand is great and supply insufficient , &quot; one trader said . 
market analysts saw slim chances for market liquidity to improve in the short run . 
&quot; The trend on this market is pretty chaotic . 
one day there is hardly any money , and then funds appear the next day . 
it is difficult to work under such conditions , &quot; an analyst said . 
introduction of the 15 percent reserve requirement was only the tip of the iceberg for the troubled banking sector . 
but companies also shared liquidity problems . 
traders cited state liabilities to companies as a major cause of the enterprise sector insolvency , and said there was no major solution on the horizon .
