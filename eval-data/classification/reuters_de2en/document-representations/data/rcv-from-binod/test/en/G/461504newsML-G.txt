Britain &apos;s minority Liberal Democrats inisted on Saturday that they would take legal action if attempt are made to leave leader Paddy Ashdown out of a planned television election debate between political leaders . 
Prime Minister John Major agreed last week to meet opposition Labour leader Tony Blair in what would be Britain &apos;s first ever head-to-head television election debate between the two main contenders for the premier &apos;s job . 
no date or format has been set for the debate , which has been complicated by complaints from the Liberal Democrats that they are being squeezed out . 
&quot; Any attempt to remove Paddy Ashdown from the main proceedings will be challenged by us in the courts ... Any programme format must substantially be based on interactive debate between the three leaders , &quot; said Liberal Democrat election chairman Lord Holme in a statement . 
major &apos;s Conservatives are some 25 points behind Labour ahead of the May 1 national election with the Liberal Democrats trailing in third with about 10 percent of the vote .
