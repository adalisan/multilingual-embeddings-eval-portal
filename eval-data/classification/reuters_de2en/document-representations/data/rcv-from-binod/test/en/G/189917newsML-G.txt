Canada said on Thursday that a reconnaissance team will leave for Zaire later in the day to assess the situation in the Central African country ahead of a Canadian-led multinational humanitarian relief mission there . 
defence Department spokesman Cpt . 
Ian Stock said the advance team would have between 24 and 30 members , some of whom would come from the special Disaster Assistance Response Team ( DART ) formed by the Canadian military to provide humanitarian relief at home and abroad . 
&quot; They basically have to assess the situation and come back and make recommendations , &quot; Stock said . 
he said he did not know how long the advance team would stay in Zaire but that the main multinational force would not leave for Central Africa until the advance team was back . 
the advance team is scheduled to leave around noon ( 1700 GMT ) on Thursday from the military base in Trenton , Ontario . 
the team would leave on two Hercules cargo planes . 
Canada last weekend offered to lead a multinational relief force to help more than a million mainly Hutu refugees in Zaire . 
the mission came one step closer to reality on Wednesday when the United States agreed in principle to participate in the effort . 
Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire face starvation and disease after being displaced by weeks of fighting between the Zairean army and Tutsi rebels .
