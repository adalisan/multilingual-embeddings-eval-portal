as 1996 draws to an end , the one-year-old Beirut Stock exchange continues its comeback on the domestic and regional scenes with plans for new listings and market developments . 
trading floor chief Fouad Baalbaki said the BSE would diversify and increase traded securities , open up the domestic financial market to non-Lebanese investors and introduce a new trading method for continuous pricing in 1997 . 
&quot; The year 1997 will mark our move to trade in corporations . 
it will also witness the realisation of plans made the previous year to add to the liquidity of the market and make it accessible to non-Lebanese investors , &quot; he told Reuters in an interview . 
&quot; We have achieved the first step with the listing of a bank and looking for further trade in shares of other sectors , &quot; he added . 
Baalbaki was referring to the listing of Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce shares authorised by the stock exchange earlier this week for trade on Monday , the last trading day of the year . 
over three million B shares underlying Global Depository receipts issued by the bank will also be listed for later trading . 
this will add at least $ 50 million worth of stocks to the shares listed on the Beirut bourse . 
the capitalisation of the market is currently calculated at a little over $ 2 billion . 
&quot; This significant transaction which provided the BLC with both domestic and international presence will serve as a reference for all banks wishing to list on the market , &quot; Ziad Makkawi of Beirut-based Middle East Capital Group said . 
MECG was lead-manager of the domestic offering and co-manager of the international offering . 
the transaction was made possible under a law passed this year allowing Lebanese banks to trade 30 percent of their shares on the exchange without prior permission from the central bank . 
Makkawi said MECG was working on several projects to list banks and companies from various industries on the exchange in 1997 . 
Baalbaki said four banks including Audi and Byblos and two new firms &quot; are planning to list by the end of February &quot; . 
he declined to give further details . 
&quot; The banking sector has realised the need to grow through the injection of fresh capital . 
this will increase their ability to offer medium and long-term credit for the economy , &quot; he said . 
plans designed in 1996 to enlarge Beirut &apos;s bourse and open it up to regional markets will bear fruits next year and give a much-needed boost to the lacklustre BSE , Baalbaki said . 
a a cross-trading agreement between the stock exchanges of Lebanon , Kuwait and Egypt will go into effect on January 6 after brokers from the three exchanges signed 121 bilateral deals to cross-trade equities . 
a Solidere 10-for-one share split for each existing $ 100 share to be realised on the same day is expected to &quot; increase the volume of traded shares and pave the way for smaller dealers to come into the market , &quot; Baalbaki said . 
nine shares of five companies are currently trading on the BSE which reopened last January after a 13-year closure during the 1975-1990 civil war . 
these include Solidere &apos;s and , Ciments Libanais , Ciments Blancs &apos; and , Eternit and Uniceramics &apos; and shares . 
&quot; quiet trade in 1996 can be attributed to the lack of diversified goods to sell . 
all shares trading represent only one sector of the economy , that related to construction , &quot; Baalbaki said . 
he said the BSE was planning to switch from a daily price-fixing system to a continuous pricing method in 1997 with the assistance of the Paris Bourse . 
&quot; In January we will discuss the technicalities of the new system with French bourse officials in preparation for signing a deal , &quot; he said
