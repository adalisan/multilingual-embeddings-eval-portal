September BTPs will drift lower in the near term towards support at 135.80 , but the longer term bull trend remains intact , technical analysts said on Tuesday . 
they added the market would struggle to move up independently of Bunds , with the 10-year spread near record lows under 100 basis points . 
&quot; We &apos;re waiting for Bunds , &quot; said one trader at an Italian bank in London . 
&quot; But the one week objective is still 136.70 . 
the trader put good support at 136.00 , then 135.80 . 
charts show the market hit a daily high of 135.84 last Friday . 
&quot; But every support is a buying opportunity , &quot; he said . 
Marc Ostwald , technical analyst at London Bond Broking , said if BTPs did see a correction , it would be fairly major . 
&quot; The market &apos;s still overbought , but it has been for ages . 
having rallied eight points without a correction , you have to ask when you &apos;re going to get one , &quot; he said . 
Ostwald put support at 135.84 , the high from last Friday , followed by a prop at 135.33 / 35 . 
the market hit a low of 135.33 on Monday and 135.35 last Friday . 
&quot; But a major setback would see the market trading down to congestion at 134.70,74 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If we don &apos;t push up much further on Bunds , this market has to come back because I don &apos;t see many people buying the spread at 100 basis points , &quot; Ostwald added . 
Ostwald put initial resistance at Monday &apos;s high of 136.40 , followed by 136.60 , the first resistance on pivot point analysis , then 137.00 . 
&quot; For the moment the momentum is with it . 
the trend &apos;s your friend , &quot; he said . 
September Eurolira was down two basis points at 93.46 .
