Pernilla Wiberg &apos;s best chance of salvaging her Sestriere Alpine skiing world championships hopes seems to lie now with Thursday &apos;s combined event . 
the world and Olympic champion arrived in Italy as the golden girl , winner of two titles in 1996 to go with the three other golds she has gathered in her career , and on course to become the first Swedish woman to win the overall World Cup title . 
in Sierra Nevada last year , her all-round performance won her a car as the best skier on the slopes . 
it has all gone horribly wrong in Sestriere , where Wiberg has been struggling to overcome sickness . 
winner of the slalom last year , she crashed out of that discipline last week and followed that by finishing sixth in the giant , suffering from a cold and losing a ski pole . 
she was only seventh in Tuesday &apos;s super-giant slalom . 
&quot; These world championships are pretty disappointing for me , &quot; she said , in case any one had any doubts , after a couple of mistakes cost her all hope of a super-G medal . 
with just two races left , she needs to take a medal in either the combined or Saturday &apos;s downhill . 
otherwise she will be heading home to Monte Carlo without a gold from a major event for the first time . 
until now she has won at least one in every Olympics or world championships she has entered since 1991 . 
she has never won any other colour of medal . 
the downhill looks a long shot , although she has made it her major target since she has never won one before . 
the combined is another story . 
Wiberg won the only World Cup event held this season in Laax on February 2 . 
Hilde Gerg of Germany was second and Anita Wachter of Austria was third . 
they will again be her major rivals along with Austrian Renate Goetschl in an event that combines a downhill with a night slalom . 
the diminutive Wachter , in her seventh championships , may well prove the bigger threat of the two since she too is looking to salvage something from the wreckage . 
fifth in the event in 1987 and 1989 , third in 1993 and second in 1996 , the 1988 Olympic combined gold medallist dreams of taking the final step up the world podium . 
before Sestriere , Wachter who was 30 on Wednesday , seemed committed to going on to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan . 
now she is not so sure . 
disappointment or success in Sestriere could tip the balance either way as far as her career is concerned . 
Gerg , dubbed &quot; Wilde Hilde &quot; by the German media , will also be fired up after finishing third for the first medal of her promising career in Tuesday &apos;s super-G . 
other contenders will be less well-known names such as Norwegians Trude Gimle or Ingeborg Helen-Marken , Switzerland &apos;s promising Catherine Borghi or German Sibylle Brauner . 
one thing most of them can be reasonably positive about is that the host nation , whose skiers have won the first three women &apos;s races , will not come up with yet another winner . 
Morena Gallizio finished sixth in the Laax combined but has otherwise posed no threat this season . 
the best combined finish an Italian woman has achieved at major Alpine events in the past half century was a third place by Giuliana Minuzzo in the 1956 Olympics in the days when it was a paper victory before separate races were created .
