Yen-based Tokyo precious metals futures ended lower in lacklustre trade on Tuesday , pressured by weaker spot prices , traders said . 
gold futures ranged from four yen to 11 yen per gram lower . 
benchmark June was off 11 yen at 1,207 yen . 
spot gold was quoted at $ 321.50 / 90 per ounce at 0723 GMT , against $ 321.10 / 60 in New York on Monday . 
Japanese were tending to hold bearish views on spot gold prices . 
they said yen-based gold prices were likely to be supported at around 1,200 yen due to the yen &apos;s weaker tendency against the dollar . 
in gold futures , private investors largely retreated to the sidelines due to low volatility in yen-based prices , with declines in dollar-based gold prices offset by currency moves . 
the market focus is on the U.S. financial markets &apos; reaction to a U.S. Fed policy-setting meeting later on Tuesday . 
&quot; Gold may test support at $ 320 unless a significant downward correction takes place in U.S. stocks , &quot; one trader said . 
trading in platinum group metals ( PGMs ) was directionless and activity was focused on technical factors , although traders expected the downside potential for PGM prices to be limited . 
&quot; lingering doubts over Russian metal supplies , especially after January of next year , as well as good palladium demand from the auto catalyst sector and the need to cover short positions on TOCOM , are likely to prevent palladium from falling sharply , &quot; one trader said . 
he expected platinum futures to correct further to the downside , as physical platinum is not as tight as palladium . 
benchmark June palladium closed one yen lower at 702 yen a gram , while June platinum was off 12 yen at 1,479 yen a gram and June silver was down 1.9 yen per 10 grams at 173.9 yen .
