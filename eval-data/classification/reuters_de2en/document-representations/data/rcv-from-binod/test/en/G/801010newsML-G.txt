Cambodia &apos;s newly appointed First Prime Minister Ung Huot said on Thursday that King Norodom Sihanouk had given his blessing to Phnom Penh &apos;s new government during a meeting in Beijing . 
Ung Huot and his powerful co-premier , Hun Sen , had five hours of talks with Sihanouk at the king &apos;s Beijing residence on Tuesday . 
&quot; The king gave us his blessing and recognises the prime minister , &quot; Ung Huot told reporters at Phnom Penh airport upon his return from Beijing , where Sihanouk has been receiving medical treatment since February . 
Hun Sen toppled Sihanouk &apos;s son , Prince Norodom Ranariddh , on July 6 and then backed Ung Huot &apos;s nomination to replace the ousted prince . 
he had previously ruled with Ranariddh in an uneasy coalition government that took power after U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 . 
last week Sihanouk called Ung Huot a &quot; puppet &quot; of Hun Sen and said he still recognised Ranariddh as the legitimate first premier . 
Ung Huot showed reporters a copy of a news agency report that had been annotated by Sihanouk . 
next to a section of the report that said the Cambodian delegation had come to seek the king &apos;s blessing , the monarch had written : &quot; At lunch , I toasted their health . 
&quot; That means the king already gives his blessing , &quot; Ung Huot said , pointing to Sihanouk &apos;s hand-written note . 
political analysts in Phnom Penh said the king &apos;s approval was the last hurdle facing Hun Sen in his bid to legitimise his new government . 
Sihanouk had offered to abdicate on Monday , but said later that in their Tuesday meeting , Hun Sen had refused the offer . 
the king said on Thursday he would return to Cambodia before the end of the month to hold a Buddhist ceremony for peace and national reconciliation in Siem Reap , home of the famed Angkor temple complex . 
Hun Sen told reporters he had assured Sihanouk that he was the defender of the monarchy . 
&quot; There were some people who reported to him that I will completely destroy the monarchy , &quot; Hun Sen told reporters . 
&quot; I told the king and queen , please consider us the defenders of the monarchy . 
if anyone wants to end the monarchy , they have to put an end to my life first , &quot; he said . 
Hun Sen said the king also would attend the first meeting of Cambodia &apos;s Supreme Council of Magistry , a body , yet to be set up , that will oversee the functioning of the judicial system . 
but he gave no date . 
Hun Sen also dismissed a suggestion from the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) that an informal meeting of all parties involved in the Cambodian problem be held , including Ranariddh and Hun Sen. 
&quot; Any attempt to call an informal meeting between the government of Phnom Penh and Ranariddh would be a waste of time , &quot; Hun Sen said . 
ASEAN postponed Cambodia &apos;s entry to the group after Ranariddh was overthrown and has been trying to mediate a solution to the country &apos;s problems . 
Hun Sen insisted that if Ranariddh returns to Cambodia , he would have to face charges for illegal negotiations with the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group and for alleged weapons smuggling . 
last week the Cambodian National Assembly voted to strip Ranariddh of his parliamentary immunity and a military court subsequently issued a warrant for his arrest . 
asked if Ranariddh would be allowed to take part in an election planned for May next year , Hun Sen said : &quot; The question of joining the election or not , you have to ask the court .
