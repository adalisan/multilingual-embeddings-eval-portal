Japanese shares trading in London were flat to slightly lower on Thursday amid nervousness ahead of March futures and options expiry in Tokyo on Friday . 
&quot; Stock prices in London certainly reflected the fact that people thought we &apos;ve got a weaker opening ( in Tokyo ) tomorrow , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; It has been pretty quiet . 
the Nikkei / Ise 50 share index finished 21.04 points lower at 1,397.64 points . 
in Tokyo , the Nikkei 225 average had ended at its lowest level since February 7 , shedding 282.79 points to 17,900.48 . 
&quot; It has been a very nervous day ahead of the special quotation tomorrow , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; The generally held view is that it will probably have a negative impact and could take the market down around 200-points at the opening . 
among individual features , traders said they had seen buying interest in Daiwa Securities Co Ltd which was weak in Tokyo on rumours that it was being investigated by Japan &apos;s securities watchdog . 
&quot; It was fairly strong in the morning , until a large seller came in and took it down in the afternoon . 
the shares finished at 880 yen in London , down from a Tokyo close of 900 yen .
