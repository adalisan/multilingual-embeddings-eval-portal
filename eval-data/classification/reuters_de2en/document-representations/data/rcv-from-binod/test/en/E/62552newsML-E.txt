surging imports including costlier foreign oil sent the U.S. trade deficit soaring in July to its highest level in more than eight years , the Commerce Department said Wednesday . 
the shortfall on trade with the rest of the world shot up 42.6 percent to $ 11.68 billion -- far above the $ 8.8 billion forecast by Wall Street economists -- from a revised $ 8.19 billion in June . 
the value of imports climbed 1.2 percent to $ 78.87 billion in July while exports of American-made products shrank for a second straight month , down 3.6 percent to $ 67.19 billion .

commerce Department officials said the July deficit was the highest since late 1987 , when monthly shortfalls during the fourth quarter averaged $ 12.9 billion . 
previously , Commerce said the June trade deficit was $ 8.11 billion but it revised that up slightly . 
the politically sensitive trade gap with Japan widened sharply in July by 32.9 percent to $ 4.31 billion as it once again became the country with which the United States has the largest monthly deficit . 
new-car imports from Japan were nearly $ 300 million higher in July than in June , Commerce officials said , while exports to Japan fell . 
the deficit with China , which temporarily overtook Japan in June as the largest single contributor to the U.S. trade deficit , grew again in July by 14.7 percent to $ 3.82 billion . 
imports from China were a record $ 4.8 billion in July . 
the United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits . 
in July , the merchandise deficit widened sharply to $ 17.52 billion from $ 14.62 billion in June . 
the surplus on services contracted to $ 5.84 billion from $ 6.43 billion in June . 
there were a few areas of bilateral trade improvement in July . 
the deficit with Mexico was down seven percent to $ 1.38 billion while the shortfall with Canada dropped in July by 19.3 percent to $ 2.1 billion . 
but the monthly gap with Western Europe more than quadrupled to $ 4.25 billion from $ 761 million in June . 
exports to Europe fell $ 2 billion in July , partly because of a $ 566 million plunge in aircraft exports and a $ 200 million drop in computer sales . 
overall foreign sales of civilian aircraft plummeted $ 686 million in July to $ 856 million while foreign sales of U.S.-made cars and parts fell $ 345 million to $ 5.18 billion . 
the cost of imported crude petroleum rose 10 percent to $ 4.7 billion in July -- the highest for any month since October 1990 when $ 4.8 billion of petroleum was imported . 
the price per barrel of imported crude oil was up to $ 18.24 from $ 18.02 . 
analysts said before the report was released that stronger growth in Europe and Japan were expected to bolster U.S. exports in coming months , but exports to both were weaker in July than was the case in June .
