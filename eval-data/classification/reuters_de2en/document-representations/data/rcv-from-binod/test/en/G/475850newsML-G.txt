France &apos;s far-right National Front ends its 10th party congress on Monday in an optimistic mood about its election prospects after reconfirming Jean-Marie Le Pen as its president . 
&quot; We are at the gates of power ... We are the founding movement of 21st century France , &quot; the Front &apos;s number two Bruno Megret told delegates hopeful that it can gain a foothold in parliament in elections in a year &apos;s time . 
Le Pen predicted to reporters that the Front would win 10 or 20 seats and could get more if there were &quot; explosive events &quot; before next March , such as a mass exodus to France of Algerians fleeing civil violence between the authorities and Moslem rebels . 
Party working groups have drafted a legislative agenda , proposing to ship home even legal immigrants and instituting a preference in jobs and social benefits for &quot; native-born &quot; French people . 
the draft programme also proposes salaries for mothers without paid jobs and the scrapping of a law which bans encouraging racial , ethnic or religious hatred . 
speakers at the congress in the eastern city of Strasbourg voiced confidence that the Front was headed for power , although it now has no seats in parliament and opinion polls to date suggest it may yet fail to win any next year . 
&quot; Our opponents may well reassure themselves with all the world &apos;s polls , great political upheavals do not happen gradually , but suddenly , &quot; Megret said . 
Le Pen was re-elected president by acclamation after an hour-long speech touting Front successes and attacking its foes , including the estimated 40,000 people who marched through Strasbourg on Saturday in protest at his growing influence . 
he also urged European far-rightists to pool their resources to increase their power in European politics . 
&quot; We propose in coming days a form of ... political cooperation between our countries . 
why not call this &apos; Euro-Nat &apos; -- a grouping of the Europe of nationalists , of the Europe of nationals , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Mr Le Pen is in the vanguard of the nationalist movement , &quot; Ricardo Saenz de Ynestrillas , visiting president of Spain &apos;s Parti Alianza Unidad Nacional , told cheering delegates . 
March organisers claimed their protest , which was believed to be the largest ever assembled against Le Pen , marked a turning point in their campaign to curb the Front &apos;s influence in French politics . 
but its impact was marred by evening clashes between police and young people after the march had ended . 
Strasbourg &apos;s Socialist mayor , Catherine Trautmann , condemned the violence and cancelled a rock concert set for Sunday night . 
Le Pen , 68 , has refused to discuss the question of a successor . 
but principal deputies Megret and Bruno Gollnisch revealed their ambitions in open wrangling for the upper hand in elections to the party &apos;s key central committee . 
Megret later boasted to reporters that he won more votes than his rival .
