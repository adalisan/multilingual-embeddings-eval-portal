the government &apos;s surplus for 1997 / 98 is expected to be between $ 1.5 billion and $ 2 billion , Radio New Zealand reported today . 
the Budget is due on June 26 and market expectations prior to this week had been for a surplus of $ 2.9 billion . 
the radio item said a speech this afternoon by Treasurer Winston Peters would indicate a lower surplus for the second time in two days . 
on Thursday he told parliament he believed external forecasts did not take sufficient notice of the impact of one-off items cutting into next year &apos;s expected surplus . 
&quot; Our political staff say Winston Peters is softening the ground for next Thursday &apos;s Budget , which is likely to reveal the surplus has fallen to somewhere between $ 1.5 billion and $ 2 billion - almost half the March figure , &quot; Radio NZ said . 
in March the government predicted a $ 3.3 billion surplus for the 1997 / 98 year . 
Treasury and minsterial officials were not prepared to comment on the speculation about the number , but Peters was due to start speaking at 1.15 p.m. ( 0115 GMT ) in Auckland .
