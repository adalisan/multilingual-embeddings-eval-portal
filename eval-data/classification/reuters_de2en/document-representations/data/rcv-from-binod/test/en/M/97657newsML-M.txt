the ringgit moved up in the afternoon on buying by a Hong Kong-based institution for a large corporate deal in Malaysia , dealers said on Friday . 
they said the buying triggered dollar selling by several Swiss banks in Singapore around the 2.5020 level . 
&quot; Once 2.5020 was broken it triggered a lot of stop losses along the way , &quot; said a dealer with a U.S. bank in Singapore . 
at 0700 GMT , the ringgit was at 2.5003 / 13 per dollar , after hitting a high of 2.4995 , against 2.5023 / 30 at close of Kuala Lumpur on Thursday . 
it was at 1.7716 / 36 per Singapore dollar against 1.7741 / 58 . 
&quot; The ringgit is also aided by a rumour that Malaysia will report a trade surplus in August and some fresh ringgit / sing buying , &quot; said a dealer with another U.S. bank in Singapore . 
Malaysia &apos;s trade data for August is not due until the second-half of the month . 
dealers said the large corporate deal which triggered the afternoon activity was probably German Deutsche Telekom transferring funds to buy 20-22 percent equity in Malaysia &apos;s Technology Resources Industries Bhd ( Tri ) for around 1.42 billion ringgit .
