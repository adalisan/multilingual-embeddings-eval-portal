a rangebound dollar / yen is seen probing for a top , and in the process short-term bullishness could push it back to 115.70 , chartists said . 
the dollar is currently plodding around in front of equilibrium resistance at 114.70 yen . 
ending above this chartpoint would point it higher in the near term , they said . 
&quot; If we get a good solid close above 114.75 yen , we should see an attempt at last week &apos;s high at 115.70 and potentially a 38.2 percent retracement up to the 117 area , &quot; said Randolph Donney , director of capital markets research at Pegasus econometric Group . 
an important high from May 28 lies at 117 yen . 
that level also marks the 38-percent Fibonacci retracement target of the dollar &apos;s fall from 127.47 on May 1 to 110.62 on June 11 , analysts said . 
&quot; We will turn bullish and stop looking for a medium-term range environment only on a move above 117.10 , &quot; said Darren Spain , global foreign exchange analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston . 
Spain said the top of the range for the two to three months may already be in place at 115.70 yen . 
short-term support for the dollar comes in at 114 yen , followed by 113.75 , analysts said . 
meanwhile , dollar / mark looks shakier with analysts eyeing a potential double top above 1.74 . 
support between 1.7200 and 1.7220 marks now looks vulnerable , with a return to the June 9 low at 1.7020 targeted if those props yield , they said . 
&quot; If we get down to the pullback low after 1.7425 marks ( the June 6 high ) ... and if we lose that , then it would be considered at double top at 1.7425-1.7405 , &quot; said Scott Siller , a senior technical analyst at MCM CurrencyWatch . 
&quot; Close enough to be a double top , technically .
