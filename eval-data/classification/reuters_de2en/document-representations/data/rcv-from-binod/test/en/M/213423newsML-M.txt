U.S. debt futures ended mostly higher in thin , pre-holiday trading conditions , traders and analysts said . 
one major U.S. institution sold 2,000 December T-bonds as the contract dipped below 115-21 / 32 , one floor source said . 
otherwise T-bond futures held an impressive bid for most of the day , slowly creeping to the daily high of 115-25 / 32 on local short-covering . 
small hedge fund buying and a 2,000 purchase from a large local trader in the pit forced locals to cover short positions , floor sources said . 
December T-bonds failed to test the nine-month high of 115-29 / 32 , which was set last week and represents a key retracement level from the contract &apos;s yearly high of 120-15 / 32 to the year &apos;s low of 104-30 / 32 , analysts said . 
some traders said the front-page article in the Wall Street Journal initially weighed on the market . 
the article suggested the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates to spark a much-needed correction in the U.S. stock market . 
&quot; We haven &apos;t had a 10 percent correction in six years , &quot; David Hale , chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments , said . 
&quot; The Fed would love to see a correction , &quot; he said . 
however , traders and analysts remained committed to the idea that stronger-than-expected inflationary data would lead the Fed to tighten rates . 
&quot; At this juncture a Fed tightening before February is off , &quot; one cash bond trader said . 
on the other hand , traders are not anticipating a Fed easing , particularly ahead of data on fourth quarter activity .
