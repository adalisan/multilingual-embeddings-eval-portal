Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak returned home on Sunday after a brief visit to the Gulf , airport sources said . 
Mubarak on Friday stopped over in Kuwait and later Saudi Arabia for talks with leaders there on Arab relations and the stalled Middle East peace process . 
Israel &apos;s decision last month to begin building a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem angered many in the Arab world and brought the peace process to a halt . 
Mubarak told Egyptian television on Friday he opposed holding an Arab summit at present because it could complicate peace talks by taking collective measures against Israel . 
but a mini-summit could be held &quot; for the sake of peace and not to take decisions , &quot; he added .
