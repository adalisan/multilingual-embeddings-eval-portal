CBOT soft red winter wheat futures posted modest gains on Monday amid concerns of weather problems in other major wheat growing countries , traders said . 
&quot; There &apos;s really no need for it to go down at this time when you look at the potential problems out there with Australia and Argentina and even Canada , &quot; said Randy Mittelstaedt , grain analyst with Merrill Lynch . 
he was referring to persistent dry weather in Australia that recently led the Australian Wheat Board to trim its production estimate . 
Argentina has also suffered from lack of moisture but recent rains in Canada have eased stress there . 
floor sources also pointed to rains in the northern U.S. Plains which slowed the spring wheat harvest this weekend . 
there was also talk of increased scab damage in North Dakota due to continued wet weather there . 
but wheat drew bearish input from news a weekend cold front did not drop temperatures far enough to damage wheat on Canada &apos;s prairies . 
environment Canada said no significant frost was reported on Sunday or Monday mornings . 
wheat ended 3-1 / 2 to 1 / 2 cent per bushel higher with December up 3-1 / 4 at $ 3.72-3 / 4 a bushel . 
export data was deemed mildly supportive . 
USDA on Monday said there were 27,845,000 bushels of wheat inspected for export in the week ended August 14 . 
the trade had expected the figure to fall between 22 million and 26 million bushels . 
the inspections figure , along with news Pakistan was set to tender for 350,000 tonnes of optional origin soft white wheat and talk that Egypt would tender for wheat added to the export optimism , traders said . 
on the day , Continental grain bought one million bushels December while Cargill Inc and Term commodities were said to be light buyers of the December . 
Merrill Lynch and Tenco Inc each bought 1.5 million December and Refco Inc bought 1.5 million December and sold two million December , pit sources said .
