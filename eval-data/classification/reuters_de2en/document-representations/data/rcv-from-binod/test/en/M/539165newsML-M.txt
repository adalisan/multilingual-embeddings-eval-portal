the dollar rose on Friday against the German mark and recouped overseas losses versus the Japanese yen as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and President Bill Clinton eased market fears that Sunday &apos;s Group of Seven meeting would alter dollar policy . 
briefing reporters on the G7 gathering , Rubin said late Friday that U.S. policy for a strong dollar remains unchanged . 
following Rubin &apos;s remarks was a meeting between President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto which showed no apparent friction over Japan &apos;s growing trade surplus with the United States . 
shortly after , the dollar hit a session high of 1.7290 marks and 126.36 yen and closed higher at 1.7270 / 80 marks from 1.7160 / 65 at the open and 126.20 / 30 yen from 125.62 / 67 . 
Clinton later told a news conference he does not want a weak dollar simply to improve the United States &apos; trade position nor foreign exchange rates thrown &quot; out of whack &quot; . 
currency dealers had been concerned Japan &apos;s bilateral trade surplus , which rose in March for the sixth consecutive month , could encourage government officials to support a stronger yen at the expense of the U.S. unit . 
Rubin also repeated past remarks that he shares Japan &apos;s concerns about the weakness of the yen and that currencies should not be used as trade tools . 
&quot; The Rubin comments were exactly as expected . 
I don &apos;t think he said anything different than he has said all along , &quot; said John Nelson , foreign exchange trading manager at ABN-AMRO Bank . 
the dollar &apos;s rise above 1.72 marks was sparked by a wire service report which quoted Deutsche Bank chief economist Norbert Walter as saying the United States , Germany and Japan would tolerate a dollar rise to 1.80 marks and 130 yen . 
however , the dollar &apos;s move higher quickly lost momentum when market makers realized the report &apos;s source was not a German government economist , as initially thought . 
&quot; I think it got the ball rolling , but it really shouldn &apos;t have , &quot; said James Powers , a vice president at West Deutsche Landesbank Girozentale . 
&quot; There were just a lot of stops ( buy orders ) that were above 1.72 marks . 
in early U.S. trade , the dollar and mark were jostled by conflicting comments from German central bankers and politicians regarding the likelihood of Europe &apos;s push for a single currency meeting its 1999 deadline . 
Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said the prospect of a delay should not be &quot; categorically ruled out &quot; while German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Bonn would never accept a delay in the timetable . 
in Japan , the dollar weakened against the yen as Japanese government bond futures fell more than a full point on worries Japanese life insurer Nissan Mutual Life Insurance may be forced to sell its assets , including yen bonds , after the Finance Ministry ordered it to halt operations . 
in other trading , the dollar rose to 1.4685 / 95 Swiss francs from 1.4605 / 15 and to Canadian $ 1.3970 / 75 from C $ 1.3956 / 61 . 
sterling was nearly flat at $ 1.6231 / 38 from $ 1.6230 / 40 . 
the Australian dollar slipped to $ 0.7761 / 66 from $ 0.7768 / 73 .
