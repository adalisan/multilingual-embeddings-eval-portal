the Houston Astros on Friday placed starting centre fielder Derek Bell on the 15-day disabled list with a hematoma in his left calf muscle . 
an examination Thursday revealed the hematoma , which is a mass of coagulated blood . 
bell was expected to undergo surgery to have the hematoma drained on Friday and the team said he will likely be sidelined three to four weeks . 
bell , 28 , suffered the injury Tuesday night against the New York Mets when he fouled a pitch off his left calf . 
James Mouton is the likely candidate to start in centre field in place of Bell , who was hitting .244 with two homers and 13 RBI in 37 games .
