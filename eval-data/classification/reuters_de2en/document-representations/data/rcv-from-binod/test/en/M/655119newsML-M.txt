Taiwan share prices fell in late Wednesday trade after a mixed opening as the recent bellwether sector electronics saw profit-taking intensify , but brokers said they saw support at 8,300 points . 
with 62 minutes left , at 0258 GMT , the index was down 68.81 points or 0.82 percent at 8,324.17 . 
Warrant-eligible shares rose to support the market , with Pacific Wire and Cable up 40 cents to T $ 41.3 . 
&quot; profit-taking on electronics is quite normal , &quot; said United Securities vice-president Lin Long-hsien . 
&quot; There are mixed viewpoints about the index &apos;s future trend , &quot; Lin said . 
&quot; But I believe support at 8,300 is strong and a firming trend after a short period of consolidation is very likely .
