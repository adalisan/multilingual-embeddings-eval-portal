British stocks climbed slightly but hopes of a short-term push to the psychologiaclly important 4,000 level were receding once more . 
modest profit-taking on Wall Street , which fell 11.47 points to 5877.36 on Wednesday , set the tone for trading in the London and elsewhere . 
the U.S. interest rate concerns ahead of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on September 24 , which many feel will increase rates , coupled with caution ahead of Friday &apos;s expiry of FTSE 100 futures and options , are set to cap activity . 
&quot; We &apos;re Wall Street-waiting and Wall Street-watching , &quot; said one London trader . 
&quot; But , while there is momentum for the market to go up it could still find it difficult to breach 4,000 . 
after opening lower , the FTSE 100 reversed the early fall and was showing a modest rise of 9.8 points to 3,965.5 soon after 0900 GMT . 
squaring of books by market-makers ahead of Friday &apos;s expiry were behind the turnaround , said dealers . 
&quot; The word is out with the market-makers that they want to square up their positions in case there are violent movements tomorrow , &quot; said one senior trader . 
bid speculation resurfaced early on with further buying interest on the back of talk that Germany &apos;s Bayer might be a predator for British pharmaceutical group Zeneca . 
&quot; Zeneca keeps blowing hot and cold but one day we &apos;ll come in and there &apos;ll be a bid for the company , &quot; said the trader .

in the foreign exchanges , the dollar rose slightly against the mark and the yen in early European business after clawing its way up from lows overnight . 
but in the low volume conditions dealers were looking at another quiet day &apos;s range trading . 
the dollar sank more than a yen after disappointing U.S. trade data on Wednesday which also hit its value against the mark . 
&quot; After its tumble yesterday the dollar will struggle to regain its footing , with rallies increasingly being seen as opportunities to sell into , &quot; said Tim Fox , treasury economist at Standard Chartered . 
strong psychological support at 110 yen has now turned into resistance and will prove a hard nut to crack given the current propensity to take quick profits , dealers said . 
the jump in the U.S. trade deficit to $ 11.68 billion in July from $ 8.19 billion in June took a market expecting a figure nearer $ 9.0 billion by surprise . 
analysts said it has again got the market thinking about the September 24 FOMC and what will happen to interest rates . 
they said the rise in the deficit suggests weak growth in the third quarter and puts a question mark over the need for a rate rise in the near term .
