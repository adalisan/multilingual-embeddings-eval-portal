forty five African immigrants deported to Guinea-Bissau have begun a hunger strike to press for their return to Spain , a human rights official said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Their deportation from Spain was illegal . 
they want to go back to Spain , &quot; Leopoldo Amado , a spokesman for the Guinea-Bissau League for Human Rights , said in a telephone interview from the West African state . 
he said the ejection of the Africans by Spain in June was illegal because some of them had filled in papers at a centre for immigrants in the Spanish enclave of Melilla in north Africa requesting travel to Spain before they were deported . 
one hunger striker , a Nigerian called Azeez Mohammed , told Reuters authorities in Melilla had handcuffed the group and later put them on military planes where they were served with drinking water containing sedatives . 
Spain &apos;s decision to sedate the Africans expelled from Melilla was criticised this month by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso . 
Azeez said the planes had flown to Senegal and Cameroon where authorities had turned them away before Guinea Bissau , a former Portuguese colony , accepted them on June 22 . 
Amado said Spanish authorities had bribed the Guinea Bissau government to take them . 
the Africans were presently housed in a cramped police prison in the capital Bissau , sleeping on the floor and served just two meals a day , Azeez said . 
the hunger strikers could leave the prison by bribing the guards , he added , speaking from the human rights office . 
&quot; The hunger strikers want to be transferred to a hotel in Bissau from the prison . 
they are not criminals , &quot; Amado said . 
he added that the hunger strikers were demanding medical treatment during their stay in Bissau . 
Guinea Bissau officials have said they planned to send the immigrants back to their countries of origin -- Nigeria , Liberia , Cameroon , Togo , Central African Republic and Rwanda . 
the Africans had ended an earlier hunger strike lasting four days this month after Guinea-Bissau Interior Minister Amaro Correia assured them he would mediate a solution with Spain . 
but when Bissau officials later changed their position and said they would repatriate the men , the Africans decided on Tuesday to start an indefinite hunger strike . 
&quot; They are taking nothing -- no water or salt , &quot; Amado said . 
Guinea-Bissau authorities had already repatriated five of the original group of 50 to neighbouring Guinea , he said . 
the group are among hundreds of Africans who try to cross the narrow Strait of Gibraltar into Spain from north Africa every year in search of a better life in Europe .
