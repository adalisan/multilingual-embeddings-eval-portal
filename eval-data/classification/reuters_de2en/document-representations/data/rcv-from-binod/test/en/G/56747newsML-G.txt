six astronauts climbed aboard shuttle Atlantis early on Monday and prepared for launch on a mission to fetch U.S. astronaut Shannon lucid from the Russian Mir space station . 
the $ 2 billion spaceship , carrying lucid &apos;s replacement and thousands of pounds ( kilograms ) of cargo , was scheduled to blast off before dawn on Monday on a mission to Mir delayed by nearly seven weeks . 
Atlantis &apos; crew of six , wearing bright orange pressure suits , began taking their seats in the shuttle &apos;s cockpit at about 1 : 30 a.m. EDT ( 0530 GMT ) . 
U.S. Air Force meteorologists gave Atlantis a 70 percent chance of good weather for launch during a short seven-minute launch window that opens at 4 : 54 a.m. EDT ( 0854 GMT ) . 
lucid , a 53-year-old biochemist , has been aboard the Russian space station since March and was supposed to have returned home abaord Atlantis in early August . 
the shuttle &apos;s launch , originally scheduled for July 31 , was postponed by six weeks because NASA ordered the replacement of its twin rocket boosters , fearing a dangerous flaw in the rocket &apos;s joints . 
menacing hurricanes lurking off the Florida coast forced NASA to twice haul the shuttle off its launch pad , delaying it a few more days . 
and a scheduling clash with an unmanned rocket caused a further delay . 
the three-day countdown appeared to be running smoothly in its final hours on Sunday , ending weeks of difficulty . 
&quot; There are no technical issues or weather issues that would prevent an on time lift-off &quot; said NASA launch commentator Lisa Malone . 
the shuttle &apos;s fiery blast-off will begin a three-day chase through space to catch up with the Mir complex . 
the shuttle will link up with Mir late on Wednesday and will remain docked for five days . 
Atlantis has a crew of six led by mission commander Bill Readdy . 
the pilot is Terry Wilcutt and mission specialists are Tom Akers , Jay apt , Carl Walz and John Blaha . 
Blaha , a former combat pilot and a veteran of four previous shuttle missions , will switch places with lucid and spend four months aboard Mir . 
Blaha , 54 , will be the second of six U.S. astronauts who will staff the station into 1998 . 
the shuttle is also carrying about 4,600 pounds ( 2,070 kgs ) of supplies and equipment for Mir and will return to Earth with 2,200 pounds ( 990 kgs ) of scientific samples and other gear from the station . 
Atlantis is due home on September 26 , ending lucid &apos;s record-breaking 188 day stay in space .
