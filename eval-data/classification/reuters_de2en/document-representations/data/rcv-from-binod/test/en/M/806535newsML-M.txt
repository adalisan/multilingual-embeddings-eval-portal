IPE oil futures traded lower on Monday afternoon as gasoline futures were sold in New York on fears the summer rally was over , brokers said . 
values slid after New York opened , with dealers hearing reports that Tosco &apos;s Bayway cat cracker may have restarted after production problems . 
the cracker &apos;s return would remove a key prop to the gasoline market which has been buoyant for several weeks . 
at 1500 GMT September gasoline was down just over 1.5 cents at 65.25 cents a gallon . 
&quot; There has been a bit of pressure on the selling side which has given it a more bearish tone but the volumes are not there to make it dump , &quot; said one broker . 
a cluster of support in the range from $ 18.40 to $ 18.70 is giving IPE Brent a safety net , with an immediate congestion of support levels around $ 18.70 set to provide a floor to the day &apos;s trading , brokers said . 
most dealers looking at the pattern for the week saw the market continuing to derive strength from gasoline for some time longer . 
&quot; Brent and WTI are in short-term uptrend , but some indicators suggest the danger may have increased for the longs , &quot; said Leslie Nicholas of GNI research in his daily report . 
&quot; September WTI continues to hold , just about , its bullish uptrend , &quot; said Tom James at Credit Lyonnais rouse in Singapore . 
but Monday &apos;s mood appeared to be one of consolidation , though with a downward trend .
