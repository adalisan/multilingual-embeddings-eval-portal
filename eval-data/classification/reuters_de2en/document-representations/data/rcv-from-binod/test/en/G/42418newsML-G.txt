Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said there is no need to use Malaysia as a &quot; bogeyman &quot; to frighten voters into supporting the city state &apos;s ruling People &apos;s Action Party , the Straits Times reported on Monday . 
Goh was responding to accusations by Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad that Singapore &apos;s leaders were using the issue of possible re-merger with Malaysia to scare Singaporeans . 
the Straits Times quoted Goh as telling reporters late on Sunday : &quot; If we have to use Malaysia to campaign as a bogeyman , that will have no effect . 
Goh , who is expected to call a general election soon , said the issues were more mundane like the cost of living , health care , car prices and the upgrading of housing . 
Mahathir was quoted as saying last week that statements by Singapore leaders on the merger issue had offended his party , the United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) . 
&quot; They are only trying to show that Malaysia is bad and did not practise meritocracy and that Singaporeans will be punished if they did not perform , &quot; Mahathir , president of UMNO , said . 
he said UMNO was &quot; deeply saddened &quot; that it had to hit out at Singapore . 
&quot; But we are offended by their recent statements , which are insincere . 
they are using us as the bogeyman to scare Singaporeans , &quot; he was quoted as saying . 
Singapore &apos;s former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew touched off a debate about the possibility of Singapore again becoming a part of Malaysia , as it was from 1963 to 1965 , when he raised the issue in a speech in June . 
comments by Lee that a re-merger could happen if Malaysia ended its policy of giving special rights to indigenous races and pursued meritocracy stirred controversy in both countries . 
last month Goh raised the subject , saying Singapore could be forced to ask Malaysia to take it back , on Malaysian terms , if the republic &apos;s economic competitiveness faltered . 
Goh said on Sunday : &quot; When I made the statement ... it was with good intentions . 
not to scare anybody . 
my own view is that Singapore should be carrying on as an independent country . 
that meant the only reason he would lead Singapore back to Malaysia would be if the economy failed , giving him no choice , the Straits Times quoted Goh as saying .
