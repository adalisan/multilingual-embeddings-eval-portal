a &quot; singing &quot; desert in northwestern China is humming the right tune for sand experts and raising hopes of a boom in tourism to the under-developed region , the Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday . 
amazed desert researchers discovered that the Badain Jaran desert , China &apos;s second-biggest , could produce music even when there was no wind , the official agency said . 
&quot; In the Badain Jaran the &apos; songs &apos; and melodious music could be heard almost everywhere in the desert , without even the slightest breeze , &quot; it said . 
Xinhua quoted desert expert Qu Jianjun as saying long-term movement had made the sand very clean , with each grain similar in size and pitted with tiny cellular holes . 
the sand &quot; sang &quot; because of the frictional resonance of grains with this unique surface structure , he said . 
researchers hope the experience will attract tourists to the desert , which covers parts of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia and Gansu provinces , some of China &apos;s poorest areas . 
on the Inner Mongolian plateau the Badain Jaran made sounds like flying airplanes , Xinhua said . 
it gave no other details of the desert &apos;s repertoire .
