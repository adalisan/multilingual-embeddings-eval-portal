new issue business moved up a gear on Wednesday with sterling deals dominating proceedings . 
SBC Warburg said client demand had driven two short-dated sterling FRNs which it lead managed for Bankers Trust and British chemicals giant ICI . 
&quot; A lot of people who are buying sterling want to put it into the short end because of the ( interest ) rate nervousness , &quot; a new issues trader at SBC Warburg said . 
&quot; We couldn &apos;t find any paper in the secondary market so we went ahead with these deals . 
the Bank of England &apos;s monetary policy committee , which sets British interest rates , was meeting today and Thursday when any change will be announced . 
some 16 of 23 economists polled by Reuters forecast a 0.25 point rise in the British base rate to 7.00 percent . 
however , sterling , off over four pfennigs at 3.014 marks by 1130 GMT , was on the skids ahead of the MPC decision as sentiment turned towards a &apos; no change &apos; outcome . 
also in sterling , British airport operator BAA set a 175 million stg seven-year convertible with an indicated 4.875-5.25 percent coupon and conversion premium indicated at 15-18 percent . 
that premium was in line with the 17.5 percent quoted on broker screens for its 5.75 percent convertible due 2006 . 
British TV-to-sofa rentals company Thorn launched a 100 million stg 10-year Eurobond through HSBC Markets . 
thorn &apos;s Treasurer , Mike Turner-Samuels , said in a statement that the offering was an important step in its treasury strategy since its demerger in August 1996 from thorn EMI plc . 
&quot; The 10-year bonds will extend Thorn &apos;s debt maturity profile and diversify our funding sources , &quot; Turner-Samuels said , adding the proceeds were swapped at a level below 60 b.p. 
in dollars , Aegon set a $ 200 million three-year at a 15 b.p. 
&quot; It &apos;s gone very well , much better than we expected given the time of year and the fairly steady flows we have seen recently , &quot; a syndicate manager at the lead said .
