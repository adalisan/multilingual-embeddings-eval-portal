the dollar lost ground against the mark , breaking below 1.86 marks , by late Tokyo on Wednesday due to a Bundesbank monthly report which warned that the pace of inflation has picked up , dealers said . 
the greenback also fell against the yen as long holders , who built long positions earlier above 116.50 yen , quickly dumped their positions in line with the dollar / mark &apos;s falls . 
the German central bank warned in its August monthly report that the pace of consumer price increases had picked up in the last few months and that it would be steering its policy to ensure inflation remained under control . 
&quot; It cannot be overlooked that there has been a stronger rise in consumer prices in the last few months , &quot; the bank said . 
&quot; The Bundesbank will orientate its policy in such a way that price stablity , which has been essentially achieved , can be maintained . 
dealers said the dollar could slip below 1.84 marks after it broke decisively through 1.8550 marks . 
&quot; From the Bundesbank &apos;s report , we can see that it was signalling it may possibly tighten credit . 
it also expressed concern about movements in the forex market , &quot; a Japanese city bank dealer said . 
&quot; Given this kind of mood , we may see further corrective mark buying in the near term , &quot; the dealer said . 
in the report , the central bank reiterated recent comments that it was watching currency markets closely . 
the dollar found some support around 116.20 yen , but further falls were possible should the dollar extend its losses against the mark , dealers said . 
buying of the mark against the yen intensified , sending the mark jumping above a key resistance of 62.60 / 70 yen on short-covering and stop-loss buying , dealers said . 
at 0659 GMT , the mark stood at 62.78 / 81 yen compared with 62.42 yen in New York on Tuesday . 
although sentiment towards the dollar deteriorated by late trade on the Bundesbank report , dealers were still eager to see the outcome of a series of U.S. indicators . 
dealers were particularly looking towards U.S. retail sales data due for release at 1230 GMT to determine the trend of the U.S. currency in the longer term . 
a senior Japanese bank dealer said : &quot; The market wants to see how U.S. Treasury and stock markets move after the data . 
economists forecast retail sales data would show a rise of 0.7 percent in July after rising 0.5 percent in June . 
&quot; We still clearly remember how the dollar tumbled against the yen after U.S. treasuries and Wall Street plunged last Friday . 
the dollar could be dragged down again should the retail sales results trigger heavy sales in those markets , &quot; the senior bank dealer said . 
the dollar closed at 116.23 / 33 yen and 1.8625 / 35 marks in New York on Tuesday . 
the market is also watching for possible remarks by Eisuke Sakakibara , Japan &apos;s vice finance minister for international affairs , who is scheduled to meet with U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers on Wednesday in Washington . 
Sakakibara will attend a meeting in Aspen , Colorado , from Wednesday until Saturday .
