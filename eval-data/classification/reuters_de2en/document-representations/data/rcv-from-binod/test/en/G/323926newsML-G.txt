West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Buckley was sacked on Wednesday after a poor run of results which saw his team tumble to 17th in the English first division . 
Buckley , who was manager of Grimsby for six years before taking over at the Hawthorns in October 1994 , was told recently by chairman Tony Hale that results had to improve following the club &apos;s proposed flotation on the stock market . 
in a statement on Wednesday Hale said : &quot; Alan worked very hard for the club and everyone wishes him well in the future . 
Buckley &apos;s assistant Arthur Mann becomes caretaker-manager .
