a week after beating top club Juventus 3-0 , Udinese completed a remarkable double when they beat second-placed Parma 2-0 in their serie A match on Sunday . 
the defeat was good news for both European Cup holders Juventus and third-placed Inter Milan who both won on Saturday . 
Juventus head the table with 55 points with Parma on 49 , just one ahead of Inter . 
mid-table Udinese took the game to Parma and earned their reward in the second half with a 66th minute goal by defender Alessandro Pierini and an 87th minute penalty by Oliver Bierhoff . 
&quot; My players were brilliant , just as they were last Sunday in Turin , &quot; said coach Alberto Zaccheroni who is deep in negotiations for a new contract with the northern club . 
Juventus , who play Ajax in a European Cup semifinal on Wednesday , had bounced back from last week &apos;s defeat with a 1-0 win in Bologna on Saturday while Inter beat Cagliari 2-1 to rekindle hopes of a European Cup slot next season . 
AC Milan looked no closer to Europe next season after drawing 0-0 with Piacenza at San Siro . 
Italy midfielder Demetrio Albertini hit the upright with a first half penalty and goalkeeper Sebastiano Rossi went off injured in the 31st minute . 
&quot; We were unlucky , &quot; said coach Arrigo Sacchi , still able to smile after what amounted to a dismal day . 
&quot; It &apos;s the third game in a row now where I have to say that the best man on the pitch was the opposition goalkeeper , &quot; he said referring to Piacenza &apos;s Massimo Taibi . 
Milan fans , described by club president Silvio Berlusconi as &quot; rude and uncouth &quot; after they threw flares at the pitch last weekend , protested with banners and chants . 
they also deserted part of the stadium , draping a banner over the seats reading &quot; You deserve a stadium like this &quot; . 
Fourth-placed Sampdoria , the club that has scored most goals in serie A , wasted a golden chance to close on Inter and Parma with a 0-0 draw at lowly Verona , the club that had let in most before Sunday &apos;s matches . 
the result left them on 44 points , one ahead of Lazio who thrashed bottom club Reggiana 6-1 in Rome . 
striker Igor Protti , the league &apos;s joint top scorer with Giuseppe Signori last season but almost invisible for most of this , found his form again with a first half hat-trick in the space of 15 minutes at the Olympic Stadium . 
Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved also hit two while Signori opened with a penalty in the 11th minute . 
Lazio goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani saved a penalty in the 68th minute after Lazio &apos;s Uruguayan defender Jose Antonio Chamot was sent off for deliberate handball . 
the result left Sampdoria coach Sven Goran Eriksson in a difficult spot , as he will join Lazio next season and faces an end of season battle with his future club for a UEFA cup place next season . 
Sampdoria have 44 points to Lazio &apos;s 43 . 
that &apos;s my dream , &quot; he said when asked about the dilemma . 
struggling Perugia lost 4-1 to Vicenza and finished the match with nine men after defender Salvatore Matracano and captain Federico Giunti were both sent off .
