Hungarian share prices closed in a bearish note on the Budapest Stock Exchange on Monday as the recently published corporate results failed to give an impetus . 
&quot; Hardly any positive developments occurred today and this trend seems to continue , &quot; said Attila Berecz of Raiffeisen Securities . 
&quot; Good corporate results have triggered investors mostly for sales , &quot; he said . 
BUX index fuures closed lower for all maturities , by between 13.00 to 20.50 points . 
traders said the results have encouraged mostly sales rather than purchases on the market and also investors were arranging their portfolios ahead of the end of the year on a market which was among the fastest growing bourses this year . 
&quot; We are approaching the end of the year and one could have earned quite nicely on this market and shares are not undervalued any more , &quot; Berecz said . 
&quot; Most movements are technical . 
nevertheless , meat food processor pick has edged up today , following the release of its January-September results , to close at 7,100 forints , up 50 .
