Malta and China on Wednesday signed a trade and economic cooperation agreement designed to strengthen trade relations between the two countries . 
the agreement was signed in the Maltese capital , Valletta by the Chinese assistant Minister for External Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun Guangxiang and Maltese Finance and Trade Minister Leo Brincat . 
Brincat said at the signing ceremony that the agreement &quot; is meant to promote trade and economic relations and it will be pursued subject to the domestic regulations prevailing in each country . 
he said the two countries had agreed to accord each other most favoured trading nation status . 
the minister did not give any projected trade figures under the new agreement but said the two countries will encourage and promote investment in the other country and encourage financial cooperation between their respective financial enterprises . 
trade between Malta and China is negligible , amounting to just over $ 30 million last year mostly through the export of garments and organic chemicals by China . 
in the seventies and eighties Malta received valuable Chinese technical assistance and financial help for the construction of a dry dock capable of taking 300,000 ton super tankers and in the building of some of the facilities at Malta Freeport . 
China also ordered two small ships from cash strapped Malta Shipbuilding . 
the island is now seeking to establish itself at China &apos;s gateway to Europe and North Africa through transshipment at Malta Freeport .
