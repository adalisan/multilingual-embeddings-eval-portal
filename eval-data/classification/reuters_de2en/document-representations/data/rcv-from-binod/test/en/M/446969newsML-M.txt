comments - Singapore bunker prices edged up on Monday on the back of firm cargo and strong crude values but traders saw limited room for further gains . 
&quot; The high prices may not last long because still not many buyers emerged , &quot; said one trader . 
suppliers could be forced to lower their offers like they did last week when prices slid , he said .
