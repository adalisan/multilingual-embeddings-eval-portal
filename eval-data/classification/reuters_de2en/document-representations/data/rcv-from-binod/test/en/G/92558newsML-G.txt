Taipei will cancel some privileges enjoyed by Japan &apos;s de facto diplomats in Taiwan to reciprocate for Japan &apos;s refusal to upgrade treatment of Taiwan &apos;s unofficial representatives there , a local newspaper said on Wednesday . 
the planned reprisals , if carried out , would likely deepen a growing rift between Taiwan and Japan over disputed islands . 
the Central Daily News said Japan &apos;s representatives in Taiwan would be stripped of tax exemptions and their car registrations would be downgraded to those of foreign organisations rather than diplomats . 
Taiwan &apos;s Foreign Ministry made the decision after Japan rebuffed Taipei &apos;s request to upgrade the status of its representatives in Tokyo , the report said . 
Japan has no diplomatic ties with Taiwan &apos;s Republic of China government , but they share close economic , social and cultural ties managed by offices that are embassies in everything but name . 
foreign Ministry officials declined comment on the report . 
Taipei and Tokyo are locked in a sovereignty dispute over ownership of an uninhabited East China Sea archipelago and fishing rights in waters around the islands . 
Japan &apos;s assertion of sovereignty of the islands and its use of patrol ships to keep Taiwanese vessels at bay have fuelled anti-Japanese sentiment in Taiwan as well as in Hong Kong , Macau and mainland China . 
since 1972 , Tokyo has recognised the communist government in Beijing , Taiwan &apos;s arch rival since the Chinese civil war split them in 1949 , as the only government of China .
