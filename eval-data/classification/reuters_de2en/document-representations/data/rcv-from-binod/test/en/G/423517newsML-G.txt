an earth tremor shook parts of Ghana &apos;s capital Accra on Thursday , the West African nation &apos;s 40th birthday , the head of the Geological Survey Department said . 
there were no immediate reports of damage . 
department Director Charles Oduro told Reuters the quake measured 4.5 on the open-ended Richter scale -- the same as a similar quake on January 8 . 
that quake rattled windows but caused no serious damage . 
Ghana gained independence from Britain on March 6 , 1957 , becoming the first British dependency in Sub-Saharan Africa to attain independence under majority rule . 
Accra is on a junction of two major and two minor fault lines . 
the tremors were the strongest since 1969 . 
in 1939 , an earthquake estimated by some of 6.5 , by others of 8.0 on Richter scale , killed 16 people and injured 133 in Accra . 
buildings were damaged or partially collapsed . 
in 1862 , a quake flattened most stone buildings in Accra and even the sturdy Danish-built Christiansborg Castle , still the seat of government , was rendered uninhabitable . 
&quot; The occurance of the 1939 earthquake and recent micro-seismic activities indicate that the occurance of another major earthquake should not be ruled out , &quot; a recent seismological report from the Geological Survey Department said . 
&quot; The two major fault zones in the south-east of the country are very active , &quot; it added .
