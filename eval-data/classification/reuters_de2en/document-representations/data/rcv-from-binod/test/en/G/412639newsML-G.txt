Goalkeepers will be allowed to move along their line at penalties , but they will no longer be able to handle the ball direct from a throw-in , the International Football Board ruled on Saturday . 
the board , soccer &apos;s ultimate law-making body which comprises four members from the British associations and four from FIFA , also issued a directive to referees that goalkeepers will only be permitted to hold on to the ball for a maximum of six seconds after initially getting hold of it and be allowed to take only four steps with the ball in their hands before having to release it . 
under the new laws , an indirect free kick will be awarded if the goalkeeper handles the ball after receiving it directly from a throw in . 
the Board also ruled that a goal may now be scored directly from either a goal kick or from the kick-off without another player touching it . 
in addition , the ball is now deemed in play when it is kicked or is moved forward , rather than when it has travelled its own circumference . 
the new laws come into effect on July 1 . 
the laws themselves have also been re-written for the first time since they were re-drafted by Sir Stanley Rous in 1936 . 
Sepp Blatter , FIFA &apos;s general secretary said : &quot; This is the first time in over 60 years that the rule book has been re-drafted &quot; explaining that the reason was to simplify and modernise the language and iron out any misinterpretations from one continent to another . 
but FIFA have turned down the use of video technology at matches , and also said it was against the idea of having two referees officiate in the same game . 
&quot; So far we have had no demands to have two referees in a game , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But matches should be refereed by one person and so such experiments should not be allowed . 
a plan to use video cameras as an aid to the referee in an international friendly between France and Sweden later this month was also turned down -- and it is now doubtful that any video technology will be used at soccer matches in the foreseeable future . 
&quot; We are very grateful to television for promoting our game and also for bringing in financial resources . 
but we do not want television to control our game , we do not want television to take over the responsibilities of the referee , &quot; Blatter said . 
&quot; Our game will have to live with human errors and passion . 
if it becomes a scientific game that is not good . 
television should be a good partner , but not control the game , &quot; he added . 
if the proposal had been accepted , it would have allowed the referee to consult a television monitor at the side of the pitch to help him determine questionable incidents during play . 
there has been a huge demand for video technology to be allowed at matches this week in England , following a controversial penalty awarded in an F.A. 
Cup match between Chelsea and Leicester on Wednesday . 
the match , which Chelsea won 1-0 with a penalty three minutes before the end of extra time , became the subject of intense media interest after TV replays showed the referee had wrongly awarded the deciding spot-kick .
