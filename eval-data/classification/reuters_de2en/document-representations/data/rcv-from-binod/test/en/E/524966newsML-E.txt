Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Monday it would be unfortunate if Japan &apos;s trade surplus increases again . 
&quot; Too often in the past we have seen a cycle in which Japan &apos;s trade surplus has declined and then risen again , setting off protectionist pressures and trade frictions around the world , &quot; he told a reporters &apos; lunch . 
&quot; It would be unfortunate if Japan &apos;s surplus were again to become a major asymmetry in the world economy . 
President Clinton meets Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto Friday , where the White House says he will discuss the need to boost Japanese domestic demand .
