crude prices were firm in Asia on Tuesday ( corrects day ) , sustaining strong sentiment from an overnight overseas market in which prices soared to a new post-Gulf War high . 
traders in Tokyo attributed the rally to strong demand for crude in the West due to an earlier-than-expected onset of cold weather . 
traders elsewhere also cited strong demand for transport defying both economic downturns and higher oil prices , prolonged tension in the Middle East , and a reluctance to sell with stock levels so low . 
benchmark North Sea Brent was traded at $ 24.49 per barrel on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange ( SIMEX ) on Tuesday . 
this was in line with the closing price of $ 24.45 a barrel for the November futures contract marked on London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) on Monday , the highest level there since the Gulf War ended in February 1991 . 
the previous post-Gulf War high was $ 24.39 a barrel achieved on September 12 . 
a trader at a Japanese trading house said weather forecasts had been talking of lower than average temperatures in Europe and North America this winter . 
&quot; I think the real demand is coming out earlier than usual , perhaps by half a month to a month , and that &apos;s mainly because of low stocks , &quot; he said . 
the next target for Brent crude , the world benchmark , was the $ 31.20 marked on January 1991 . 
Dubai , the regional benchmark , has been bolstered both by real demand and strong Brent prices . 
November Dubai , the most actively traded month , which was offered at less than $ 16 a barrel in October 1995 , was offered at around $ 21.95 a barrel on Tuesday . 
it topped $ 20 a barrel in September . 
the Japanese trader said he expected strong sentiment to dominate the futures market for the time being , a view which echoed those of some analysts overseas . 
the high price of oil and low inventories have prompted some oil analysts to say that global demand this year is rising faster than even the most bullish predictions . 
some industry officials say the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) may have underestimated global oil demand when it predicted an average of 71.8 million barrels per day in 1996 , even though the figure represents a sharp jump of 1.7 million barrels a day from the previous year . 
the Paris-based energy watchdog has predicted global oil demand will soar to 73.6 million barrels per day next year . 
Mehdi Varzi , an oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson , put 1996 oil demand 200,000 barrels per day higher than IEA figures , even if temperatures prove only average this winter . 
traders said demand had also been strong in countries such as India , South Korea , China and Brazil .
