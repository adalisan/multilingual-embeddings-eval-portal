finance Minister Mar &apos;ie Muhammad said on Wednesday Indonesia &apos;s foreign debt was declining due to a weakening of the yen against the U.S. dollar . 
&quot; The fall of the yen against the dollar has caused a decline in our foreign debt because about 40 percent of the debts are denominated in yen , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; It depends on who our trade partners are , &quot; Mar &apos;ie said when asked if a weaker yen was good for Indonesia &apos;s economy . 
he said the sharp fall of the yen against the dollar had helped the rupiah appreciate against the yen . 
the World Bank estimates Indonesia &apos;s foreign debt , including private sector loans , at some $ 100 billion . 
last Friday , 100 yen was quoted at 1,939 rupiah against 2,120 rupiah a year ago .
