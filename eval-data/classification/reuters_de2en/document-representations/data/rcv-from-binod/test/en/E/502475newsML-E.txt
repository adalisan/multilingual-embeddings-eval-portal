Brazil &apos;s federal tax receipts in March totalled 9.388 billion reais , Internal Revenue Service Secretary Everardo Maciel said . 
Maciel said that in nominal terms the revenue represented an 8.2 percent decline from March 1996 &apos;s 10.227 billion reais , or a 16.4 percent drop in real terms , adjusted to inflation . 
he said the drop was caused by a change in revenue collection procedures . 
in 1996 taxpayers paid in one lump sum , while this year they are allowed to divide their tax payment into four installments . 
the Internal Revenue Service said in a statement that tax revenues amounted to 25.787 billion reais in the first quarter , up from 23.736 billion a year earlier .
