Princess Diana -- the queen of lame , lycra , silk and sequins -- plans to sell some of her vast wardrobe to help charity and refashion her image . 
designers say Diana just wants fresh cupboard space . 
but a spokeswoman for the Princess of Wales confirmed on Wednesday that Diana had held talks with Christie &apos;s auction house about a charity dress sale later this year that the press is gleefully dubbing the &quot; jumble sale of the century &quot; . 
&quot; We are not in a position to reveal any details but I can confirm discussions have taken place with Christie &apos;s about a proposed charity sale , &quot; said the spokeswoman for Diana . 
Christie &apos;s confimed talks were underway for a sale that could raise a million pound ( $ 1.6 million ) for some of the causes Diana champions , such as AIDS and cancer research . 
while not quite a case of the Empress having no clothes , Diana &apos;s plans to sell off a small corner of her fabled collection is an unprecedented move by a British royal . 
the Daily Telegraph said Diana -- who singlehandedly put moribund British fashion back on the map and the rest of the drably-clad royals to shame -- planned to auction 65 gowns , many bearing the top designer names of the 1980s . 
the paper said the ex-wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles wants to shed her image as high-class clothes horse and &quot; pursue a new role outside the conventional royal mould &quot; . 
&quot; The princess is keen to put the years as a fashion icon behind her and hopes that such a move will increase public attention to her work , &quot; said the paper . 
but Diana &apos;s spokeswoman played down talk that the princess planned to donate her wedding dress -- an ivory froth of flounces and bows -- to London &apos;s Victoria and Albert Museum . 
&quot; No discussions have taken place with the Victoria and Albert , &quot; she said of the celebrated wedding gown that changed a frumpy girl into a woman worth watching . 
indeed . 
ever since that day in 1981 , Diana &apos;s very many outfits and myriad changes in style and shape have assured her blanket coverage in the magazines and newspapers of the world . 
nobody could have guessed that the chubby virgin who was to wed Britain &apos;s future king -- and duly don the taffeta and frills expected of her class -- would later blossom into the sleek , leggy woman packed into silver lame and strappy silk . 
but signs have grown recently that Diana wants to be seen as a woman of substance , not just style , as witnessed in her recent trip to Angola to publicise the dangers of landmines . 
trailed as ever by the cameras , Diana eschewed high fashion on the trip and wore jeans , flat shoes and casual shirts . 
jeans or not , the cameras were ever present and dress designers said the latest move by Diana , working girl , to recast herself yet again did not mean the end of Diana , clothes horse . 
&quot; She has thousands of clothes . 
we all need a clear-out every now and again .
