the Czech Republic and Spain played to a scoreless draw in their World Cup group six qualifier on Wednesday , in a lacklustre match that failed to live up to its marquee billing . 
the Czechs were facing their first big test since they reached the Euro 96 final , while Real Madrid &apos;s teenage striker Raul Gonzalez was looking to spark a depleted Spanish attack in his first cap . 
both sides opened their World Cup campaigns last month with high-scoring victories over the two weakest teams in the group , Spain winning 6-2 in the Faroe Islands and the Czechs thrashing Malta 6-0 . 
but Yugoslavia have already collected three wins and Slovakia two against the same two hapless victims and neither team could afford to give ground in Prague . 
like two heavyweights feeling each other out in the early rounds , both teams started tentatively , waiting to pounce on the other &apos;s mistakes . 
the Spaniard &apos;s were the first to flinch when Kaiserslautern striker Pavel Kuka &apos;s cross found an unmarked Karel Poborsky just outside the crease . 
but the Manchester United midfielder failed to control the ball , wasting what would turn out be one of the game &apos;s few good scoring chances . 
next it was the Czechs turn to falter . 
Newcastle United goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek , making his first cap in over a year , tried to clear the ball , but hit attacker Alfonso Perez and watched helplessly as it rolled just wide of the net . 
the Czechs picked up their play in the second half , putting Spain on its heels for the rest of the game . 
but veteran Valencia goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta held his ground on Pavel Kuka &apos;s dangerous turnaround blast from just outside the penalty spot , and then robbed Jan Suchoparek in the dying minutes of the game , stopping the midfielder &apos;s drive from three metres away to keep the game scoreless . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we lost points tonight because they are such an excellent team . 
they played strongly in the backfield and its too bad we missed out on the two great chances we had , &quot; said Liverpool sensation Patrik Berger . 
added Spanish coach : &quot; Raul played very well and I &apos;m pleased with our team . 
both teams could have one this match , and I &apos;m content with the result though we would have liked to have taken three points .
