Sweden &apos;s National Debt Office forecast on Wednesday that the state &apos;s borrowing requirement for May would be four billion crowns . 
the office left its forecast for the 1997 borrowing requirement unchanged from a month ago at 20-30 billion crowns . 
the May forecast of 4.2 billion crowns was 2.5 billion higher than a year ago . 
&quot; Since the previous forecast the primary borrowing requirement has fallen , &quot; the office said in a statement . 
&quot; This has been counteracted by the fact the borrowing requirement is expected to increase by about four-five billion crowns as a result of the rise in interest rates in Sweden and internationally and also due to the weakening of the crown in March . 
the debt office said the borrowing requirement for March was 1.1 billion crowns which was 4.9 billion crowns lower than in the previous forecast . 
the difference was due partly to a repayment to the Defence Material Administration from the defence industry . 
a capital gain in connection with the early redemption of a swap agreement also contributed to the difference . 
a borrowing requirement of 800,000 crowns was forecast for April which was 400,000 crowns lower than the previous forecast . 
&quot; The higher borrowing requirement for May this year is partly due to the interest payments on the national debt being expected to increase , &quot; the office said . 
&quot; Net lending is also expected to be greater than last year . 
the office said sales of a new lottery bond loan 97 : 1 amounted to about 3.5 biollion crowns . 
the final settlement of the sale is still underway .
