Hungarian shares continued a two-week rising trend , pushing the BUX index to a record high for the second day , though some heavy-weight stocks were hit by downward corrections , traders said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The market more or less stagnated in average turnover , &quot; said Peter Tolgyesi of Buda-Cash Securities . 
dealers said the market was optimistic when waiting for third-quarter corporate results . 
but after sharp price rises in the past two weeks some profit-taking was not surprising , and this week the BUX could move some 30 points either directions . 
Peter Lencs of MKB Securities said he attributed the fall of the chemicals firm Borsodchem , and the slight drop of the oil and gas company MOL in heavy turnover to correction . 
&quot; OTP is undervalued , this is neither a bad nor a small , illiquid company , &quot; Lencs said . 
the price of the drugs maker Richter , reversed a declining trend and closed at 8,140 forints from 8,050 . 
dealers said Richter and MOL appeared to stabilize , but it was still a question if their employee shares , expected to enter the bourse later this month , will push down their prices .
