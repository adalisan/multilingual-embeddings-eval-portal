Greek Cypriots stormed a police compound at a British military base on the island on Monday and freed two of their relatives held as prisoners , witnesses said . 
about 50 people , including women and children , broke through iron gates and rushed police lines outside the police compound in Episkopi , a British base on the island &apos;s southern coast . 
after scuffles with police , the crowd opened the cells where two of four Greek Cypriots were being held and freed them . 
they failed to spring a third being held in a separate wing . 
the Cypriots were arrested on Monday morning . 
one of them was initially detained on charges of building illegally at Trachoni , a village within British bases territory . 
Britain has retained two military bases in Cyprus since independence in 1960 and enjoys sovereign rights on both . 
the other Greek Cypriots were detained by the bases police when they tried to stop the arrest , locals said . 
some Greek Cypriots accused base officers of clubbing them with batons during the arrests and in the violence at the jail . 
&quot; I examined one man who had a concussion and a head injury caused by a blunt instrument , &quot; local doctor Takis Aristidou told Reuters . 
&quot; He told me he had been beaten by the bases police . 
British base spokesman Sean Tully said &quot; minimal &quot; force was used . 
&quot; The only force used was in reaction to the violence by demonstrators , &quot; he said .
