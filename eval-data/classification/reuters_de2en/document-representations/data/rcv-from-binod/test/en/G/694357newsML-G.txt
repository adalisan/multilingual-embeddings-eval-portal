Canada &apos;s growing obsession with its topless debate shifted from the streets to the stores on Saturday when the first topless shop opened in this popular Ontario resort town . 
crowds of gaping onlookers gathered as several customers -- both women and men -- agreed to shop topless to promote the opening of Tom &amp; Tina &apos;s topless Surf &amp; Sport , a clothing store fronting Wasaga Beach &apos;s most popular strip of beach . 
&quot; It &apos;s a free-spirited store , &quot; said shop owner David Blackstone , 35 . 
he said he decided to make the store &quot; top optional &quot; after the Ontario Court of Appeal in December overturned the conviction of a woman who was charged with indecency after she walked topless down an Ontario street in 1991 . 
the court ruled the law was discriminatory , paving the way for Ontario women to go topless in public as long as it was not for sexual purposes . 
Krista Wagner , 24 , doffed her Bikini top and danced briefly in front of the surf shop on Saturday alongside friend Mike Huismans , 22 , also topless , in exchange for an item of her choice from the store &apos;s merchandise . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see anything wrong with it in a beach area . 
I don &apos;t know about walking around downtown Toronto , but here it &apos;s fine , &quot; said Wagner , who shopped for about half an hour dressed only in her Bikini shorts . 
onlookers had mixed reactions . 
&quot; These girls are attention-seekers . 
Canadians are not used to this and we &apos;re trying to instill something counter to our culture , &quot; said one man who stopped to watch Wagner shop . 
but one woman said the issue was being blown out of proportion . 
&quot; It &apos;s no big deal . 
people do it all over in Italy , &quot; she said . 
police patrolling the thin strip of beach that threads through Ontario &apos;s prime resort area on Lake Huron said there were only a few &quot; confirmed sightings &quot; of topless women on the packed beaches on Saturday .
