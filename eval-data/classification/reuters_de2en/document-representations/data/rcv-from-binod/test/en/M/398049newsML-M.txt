MGE spring wheat futures ended mixed , with fund buying of the May contract lending support to the market &apos;s front end , traders said . 
&quot; We actually saw fund buying come into the May today for the first time . 
it started shortly after the midsession and caught people unaware , set off a scramble , &quot; a trader said . 
traders said the price of May wheat climbed six cents , despite the fact that the funds only bought about three million bushels of May . 
&quot; That tells you how thin it was . 
once they backed off , the market slid back down again , &quot; the trader said . 
spring wheat settled four cents per bushel lower to 1-3 / 4 cents higher , with March up 1-3 / 4 cents at $ 4.05-1 / 2 . 
traders said the March / May spread had widened out to trade at 23 cents over before the fund-buying drove it back to around 20 cents . 
it closed on paper at 20-1 / 2 cents . 
MGE spring wheat had been pressured early by hedge-related selling in the May contract . 
commercial scale-down buying was also reported early .
