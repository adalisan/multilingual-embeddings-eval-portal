the decision by cardiologists on Wednesday to delay operating on Boris Yeltsin &apos;s sick heart amounted to a prescription for weeks more political uncertainty , despite putting the Kremlin &apos;s worst fears to rest . 
the good news for the Russian president was that the doctors concluded he should be fit enough to survive heart surgery and that delaying the operation would give him an almost 100 percent chance of survival and the prospect of resuming normal work . 
the bad news was that the bypass operation will not go ahead for at least six to eight weeks and the usual period of recuperation after such surgery is six weeks to two months . 
the impact of Yeltsin &apos;s absence for at least three more months will be limited by the fact that he has already been little more than a figurehead leader for most of the summer , Russian political experts said . 
but they said there was also a danger that rivalries in the Kremlin would intensify and upset the delicate balance in the team which is governing on behalf of the 65-year-old president . 
&quot; In one sense this delay is not a sensation because Yeltsin has not controlled anything for a long time and to an extent the Russian regime is already operating without him , &quot; political analyst Lilia Shevtsova told Reuters . 
&quot; But we now have a situation of political gridlock . 
there will be a lot of uncertainly for a long time and decisions will be put off . 
what we face is unpredictability and stagnation . 
the main power rivals are widely depicted as Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , Yeltsin &apos;s stolid pro-reform prime minister for almost four years , and security tsar Alexander Lebed , an ambitious but politically inexperienced reserve general . 
another potential presidential hopeful is Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov , and Kremlin Chief-of-Staff Anatoly Chubais is widely seen as keen to accumalate power despite being an unlikely presidential challenger . 
Yeltsin looks set to delay implementing a decree to transfer his duties temporarily to Chernomyrdin until he has surgery , meaning he will continue to be in charge despite his illness . 
&quot; If powers were transferred to Chernomyrdin temporarily , everything would be clear-cut and the powers of Lebed and Chubais would be watered down , &quot; said Lyudmila Telen , deputy editor of the Moscow News newspaper . 
&quot; Without the decree , these two will continue to try to have an influence in the economy and political matters . 
Shevtsova said such rivalries and a lack of clarity over the division of power could lead to increased confusion in policy-making and a lack of coordination in decision-making . 
worse still , she said , decisions on important issues could be slowed down or put off entirely , increasing the risk of a crisis blowing up over problems such as a backlog of unpaid wages to millions of workers . 
&quot; tension could increase and problems could grow in areas such as the far east and central Russia . 
the big question is whether all these problems are concentrated at the same time , &quot; she said . 
Yeltsin &apos;s old enemy , former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , said in a radio interview that the president should resign to stop Russia becoming a &quot; hostage of unclear , troubled times &quot; . 
Gorbachev drew a parallel with the latter years of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev &apos;s rule in which his ability to govern was badly affected by illness in a period known as &quot; the era of stagnation &quot; . 
but the doctors on Wednesday played down the likelihood of that happening in Yeltsin &apos;s case , saying patients usually live for more than 10 years after the operation he is due to have . 
Kremlin aides will welcome this and be relieved not to have heard the worst possible news for them -- that Yeltsin &apos;s overall health was so poor the operation would have to be cancelled . 
presidential aides appear keen to keep Yeltsin in office as long as possible , whether he is working normally or more &quot; passively &quot; , to avoid an early presidential election which Lebed or the opposition communists might be capable of winning . 
many political analysts say Lebed is little liked in the Kremlin and that his rivals fear he would benefit from an early election after coming third behind Yeltsin in this year &apos;s poll . 
a communist success would be an even harder pill to swallow .
