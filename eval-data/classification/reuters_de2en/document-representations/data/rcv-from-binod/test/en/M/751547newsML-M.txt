German shares were inspired by the U.S. to continue their record-breaking run early on Wednesday , as an upbeat report from the Fed &apos;s Greenspan , a strong close on Wall St and a firm dollar lifted the IBIS DAX . 
&quot; The banks are up , the cars are up . 
everything is good as gold as far as I can see , &quot; a Frankfurt trader said . 
the dollar trading around 1.82 marks underpinned sentiment . 
other helpful news from the U.S. came in the shape of a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , who said the central bank might rise interest rates to head off inflation , but suggested this might not happen anytime soon . 
Greenspan &apos;s comments drove the Dow Jones Industrial index higher as investors interpreted Greenspan &apos;s comments as suggesting that Fed policy was on hold and the Dow ended the day up nearly two percent . 
traders said that this gave a valuable boost to the German share market , which has taken its lead from the Dow for many of its moves during the recent bull run . 
&quot; The whole Greenspan thing was phenomenally bullish as far as I &apos;m concerned , &quot; the broker said . 
bulls prevailed in terms of measuring the outlook for the DAX . 
one trader said he saw a technical buy signal and said that he saw the DAX hitting 4,500 points in the near term . 
shares in the limelight early on included Deutsche Bank AG , which rose over nine percent in pre-bourse trade after it reported better-than-expected results for the first half of 1997 . 
the group reported a 27.5 percent rise in group net income to 1.5 billion marks in the first half of 1997 . 
&quot; I think it was bank merger speculation and short-covering which was helping Deutsche early on , more than the figures , &quot; a trader said . 
seven out of the ten top gainers in IBIS trade were banks , including Bayerische Vereinsbank up 13.25 marks -- 13.25 percent -- at 113.25 marks and Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel Bank , up 5.60 marks , 7.52 percent , at 80.10 marks . 
both of these banks have been the focus of market attention for the last few days since they announced their intention to merge into one Bavarian super-bank .
