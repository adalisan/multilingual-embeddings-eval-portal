U.S. Midwest direct cash hogs sold steady to $ 1.00 per cwt higher than Wednesday &apos;s top prices , as frigid weather accompanied by windy conditions in some areas of the Midwest kept marketings light , livestock dealers said . 
&quot; I was out there trying to get some things done this morning and with that wind you don &apos;t want to be messing around too long , &quot; one central Iowa packer buyer said . 
Iowa and southern Minnesota hog prices were up to $ 55.00 at country buying stations and up to $ 56.00 at plants . 
Illinois hogs sold at a top of $ 56.00 in the country and $ 57.50 at plants . 
Indiana / Ohio top plant prices were $ 55.25 . 
moderating temperatures expected later Thursday in the western Corn Belt could result in more hogs showing up at country buying stations and plants , which may pull prices lower . 
mixed wholesale pork prices Wednesday also were spurring some packers to tell their buyers to hold off on buying hogs for the weekend , the dealers said . 
loins Wednesday were quoted $ 2.00 to $ 4.00 per cwt up but hams were mostly $ 4.00 to $ 5.00 lower , USDA said .
