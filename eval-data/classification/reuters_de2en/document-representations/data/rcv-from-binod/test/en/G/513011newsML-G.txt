two cars filled with gunmen fired on a hotel housing foreign journalists in the southern Albanian city of Vlore on Tuesday and escaped after a 45-minute gunbattle with hotel security , a hotel worker said on Wednesday . 
confirming a report on BBC &apos;s Albanian language radio , the worker at the Hotel Bologna said in a telephone interview from Vlore that the gunmen began shooting at the hotel from the street at around 9.45 p.m. ( 1945 GMT ) . 
no one at the small 10-room hotel was injured , he said . 
several of the guests are journalists , he added . 
five Italians , one German , and two Lebanese guests were at the hotel . 
he said one of the gunmen was hit when guards shot back . 
&quot; Two cars fired shots at the hotel last night , &quot; the worker said . 
&quot; Guards from our hotel shot back . 
the windows of the hotel were shattered . 
all the guests took cover in the central hallway . 
heavily armed soldiers from Italy , France and Spain secured two bridgeheads in Albania on Tuesday to begin protecting aid deliveries in the chaotic Balkan nation . 
they were planning to secure Vlore , which has been in control of rebels since an armed uprising began earlier this year . 
some 300 people have been killed and 700 injured during the weeks of anarchy and banditry that swept Albania after fraudulent investment schemes wiped out the savings of many families .
