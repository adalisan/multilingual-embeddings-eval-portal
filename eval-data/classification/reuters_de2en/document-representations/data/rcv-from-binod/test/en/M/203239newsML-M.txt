the U.S. Treasury market is expected to hold on to its current bullish trend , with long-term yields sliding to around 6.30 percent over the next week or so , money market chart analysts said . 
charts have shown the formation of a small bullish triangle pattern over the last few days , which could indicate the market is ripe for a fresh rally . 
&quot; It looks like we &apos;ve formed a little bullish triangle over the last few days , &quot; said Walter Burke , senior technical analyst at consulting firm MCM MoneyWatch Inc . 
&quot; If the pattern keeps progessing the way it is , it should break out to the upside , which could take prices up a point or two from here , &quot; he added . 
analysts said the expected rally could take yields on the bellwether bond to 6.30 percent from their current 6.45 percent . 
the bond yield has not been below 6.38 percent since the close of March 5 . 
chart pundits said the triangle pattern started to form shortly after the market reached an overbought position -- which could have been a sign of possible selling pressures -- and still remained fairly strong . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been fairly overbought . 
but we have been there for a bunch of days and it hasn &apos;t done anything to make the market go down sharply , &quot; said a trader at a foreign investment bank . 
the overbought position followed a strong rally over the last few weeks which was mostly tied to the release of fresh economic data suggesting the economy is slowing without any major inflationary threats . 
analysts said the long end of the yield curve has developed strong resistance between 6.42 percent and 6.43 percent . 
that area represents a 60 percent retracement from the last major bond market decline earlier in the year , when long-term yields were as high as 6.95 percent . 
&quot; There has been strong resistance there . 
we &apos;re more likely to go down ( in terms of yields ) than up , &quot; said the trader , who operates mostly on technicals . 
longer-term , the consensus among the chart bulls is that the long end of the yield curve will be trading around 6.25 percent by the end of the year . 
&quot; We have kept our call for 6.25 percent on the bond by year-end for a couple of weeks now , &quot; said a second technical trader at a foreign investment bank . 
some analysts , however , were a little more conservative on their forecasts . 
they acknowledged the market is in a bullish trend , but they dropped a word of caution . 
&quot; We got some signals on the weekly charts ... 
I &apos;m a little hesitant to be a buyer at these levels . 
I &apos;m thinking that it &apos;s a bit rich , &quot; said Joel Marver , chief technical analyst at Boston-based Technical Data . 
&quot; But we really aren &apos;t seeing meaningful pullbacks and just from a momentum standpoint , I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve identified a serious top . 
we haven &apos;t seen a level high enough that people are comfortable to sell into it , &quot; Marver added .
