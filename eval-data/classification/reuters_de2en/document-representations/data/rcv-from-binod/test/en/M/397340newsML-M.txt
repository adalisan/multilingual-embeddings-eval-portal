UK cash grain prices were mostly higher on Monday , but sellers were mostly withdrawn . 
&quot; There are a few odd trades being done , but there are no markets , &quot; said one broker . 
this view was backed up by others who added that what few sellers there had been in the market had withdrawn as the futures rose . 
&quot; People are square at the moment but the market is split 50-50 as to whether it will go up or down . 
what ever happens the business will be there for the taking from April through to July , &quot; said another broker . 
no trading was reported on the fob market where buyers and sellers were around one stg apart . 
delivered material was trading around one stg above Friday &apos;s levels , but broker said there was not much volume behind the business .
