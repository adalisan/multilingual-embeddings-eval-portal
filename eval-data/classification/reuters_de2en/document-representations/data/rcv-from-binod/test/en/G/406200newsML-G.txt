the European Parliament on Thursday attacked the Dutch presidency of the European Union for its attitude towards reform of the EU treaty . 
as president , the Netherlands is responsible for forging an agreement between the 15 member states , whose inter-governmental conference ( IGC ) on treaty reform is due to end in June . 
in a resolution supported by a large majority of Euro-MPs , the parliament slammed the Dutch for proposing strictly to limit the extension to parliament of greater decision-making powers . 
Euro-MPs said they also refused to accept a Dutch proposal to delete references to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , handicap and age from a new draft treaty article outlawing discrimination . 
the Dutch also came under fire for not including sufficient commitment to equality between the sexes in their draft of the new EU treaty . 
Dutch European Affairs Minister Michel Patijn came in for personal criticism from Euro-MPs on Wednesday night for refusing to answer their concerns about the direction the treaty reform was taking . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s stupid , &quot; Hanja Maij-Weggen , the leader of the Dutch Christian Democrats , told Reuters before a parliamentary debate on the IGC . 
Maij-Weggen accused the minister of running away from criticism .
