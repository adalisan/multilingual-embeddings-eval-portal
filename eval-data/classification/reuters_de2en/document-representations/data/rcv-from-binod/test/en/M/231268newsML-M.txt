prices across the high-yield market rose 1 / 2 to one point on Tuesday , as a lull in the pace of junk bond issuance forced investors with large cash positions to look to the secondary market as a place for investments , traders said . 
in the investment-grade market , International Business machines Corp made a splash by selling $ 850 million in 100-year debentures in a deal that caught the market by surprise . 
the deal , which was underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc , was increased from $ 500 million as a result of strong investor demand , sydnicate officials said . 
&quot; IBM has been very prudent in their debt issuance in recent years . 
they seem to have knack for selling bonds as rates near their historic lows , &quot; said Edward Oppedisano , research analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
Oppedisano noted IBM last hit the U.S. market with a large debt deal last October when rates were also relatively low . 
the offering consisted of $ 750 million of 30- and 50-year bonds , he said . 
in the junk market , despite strong demand by investors which drove up bids , traders said relatively few bondholders were willing to sell and volume remained low . 
traders said expectations for strong Christmas sales created particular demand for Kmart Corp bonds which have risen a total of three points over the past several days . 
Kmart is often used as proxy for junk investors to express their sentiment about the retail sector becuase of the large size and liquidity of the company &apos;s $ 1 billion in outstanding high-yield bonds , traders noted . 
prices on Penn Traffic &apos;s senior subordinated notes ended the day unchanged , after trading down four points in the morning . 
earlier the company reported a third quarter net loss greater than a year ago . 
the supermarket company &apos;s bonds recovered from its losses because the earnings had been largely anticipated , one trader said . 
overall , the junk market gave back about 1 / 8 of a point by the end of the day as a result of a late-day sell-off among stocks . 
in the high-grade market , Mellon Bank , which sold $ 500 million in preferred stock through a special business trust , was the only other issuer to hit the market with a large deal on Tuesday . 
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co lead-managed the transaction . 
while issuance of trust preferred stock has hammered bank and finance sector bonds primarily , the new securities have also widened spreads among similarly-structured callable utility paper in recent weeks , traders said . 
in fact , callable utility bonds were the only high-grade sector to end the day wider , traders noted . 
prices in the rest of the high-grade market were unchanged relative to treasuries on light trading volume , they said . 
the sector was also hurt on Tuesday as investors swapped into more postively convex instruments in the face of a Treasury rally earlier in the day , traders said . 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury closed 101-25 / 32 to yield 6.37 percent , down 2 / 32 from yesterday &apos;s close .
