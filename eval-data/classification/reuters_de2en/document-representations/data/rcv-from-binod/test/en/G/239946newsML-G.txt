a Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel &apos;s surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges . 
the court convicted General Antoine Lahd , head of the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war . 
Lahd , a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel . 
Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state . 
he said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon &apos;s Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit . 
the charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on Israel &apos;s side , helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods . 
shortly before Lahd &apos;s trial began , a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel . 
no date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon . 
Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi &apos;ite Moslem force -- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies . 
Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace . 
but Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd . 
former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres , calling Lahd &quot; a great Lebanese patriot &quot; , said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges . 
Peres , who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu , said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon &quot; unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders . 
the Beirut military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian Saqr , former head of the pro-Israeli Guardians of the Cedars , a small rightwing Christian civil war militia . 
Saqr , whose trial was concurrent with Lahd &apos;s , was convicted of &quot; contacting the Israeli enemy , passing information to Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon &quot; .
