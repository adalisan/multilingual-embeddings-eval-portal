Colombia quietly suspended the aerial spraying of its illicit drug crops Wednesday in apparent reprisal for the U.S. decision to leave the country on a drugs blacklist . 
there was no formal announcement of the suspension , which came just two days after Interior Minister Horacio Serpa denied that the government had any plans to retaliate against Washington &apos;s &quot; decertification &quot; of Colombia . 
but Joaquin Polo , head of the National Drug Policy office , referred to it in an interview with the Radionet news network , saying the government had ordered the immediate suspension of all aerial spraying of illicit crops . 
&quot; The fumigation programme has been temporarily suspended , &quot; Polo said , explaining that it would not resume until the government had reviewed the entirety of its anti-drug agreements with the United States . 
Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano , head of the National Police , confirmed in a subsequent interview with the same radio network that there would be no further spraying until the authorities had conducted a complete review of its effectiveness over the past year . 
&quot; We have to see if fumigation has been of any use , &quot; he said . 
a 30 percent increase in Colombia &apos;s production of coca -- the raw material for cocaine -- was cited by U.S. officials Friday for Washington &apos;s decision to decertify the country for a second year as an ally in the drug war . 
the move , which left Colombia on a blacklist alongside Afghanistan , Burma , Iran , Nigeria and Syria , enfuriated government officials who warned that all bilateral cooperation agreements with the United States would be revised because of it . 
U.S. officials favouring decertification said Colombia , which also accounts for 1.5 percent of the world illicit opium production , had also balked at the testing of new granular herbicides that would be more effective than the liquid glyphosate currently in use . 
Colombian police said the U.S. figures on coca production were skewed , however , because they failed to take into account areas that had actually been sprayed . 
and government officials said it was Washington that had failed to come up with money for the purchase of better herbicides . 
the government officials said there were only five effective months of aerial spraying last year because of a series of delays and footdragging by the United States . 
a U.S. anti-drug aid package for this year includes five upgraded crop Duster airplanes worth $ 84 million . 
two of the aircraft arrived in Colombia earlier this week and all five were due to be deployed by the end of the month . 
Col. Jose Leonardo Gallego , head of the anti-narcotics division of the National Police , said the new aircraft would now be grounded indefinitely , however . 
U.S. contract pilots began working with Colombian police in the drug fumigation programme for the first time last year . 
one was killed in January when his crop-duster crashed in an area of guerrilla concentration in the country &apos;s southeast .
