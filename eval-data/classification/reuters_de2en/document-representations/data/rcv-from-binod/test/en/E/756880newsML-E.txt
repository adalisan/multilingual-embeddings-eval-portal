China &apos;s favorable economic and financial situation in the first half of 1997 will help Beijing reach its macro-economic goals this year , central bank deputy governor Chen Yuan said on Friday . 
China &apos;s economy had maintained sound , steady and rapid growth momentum , and inflation continued to fall in the first half , the Xinhua news agency quoted Chen as telling a meeting of Asian and Pacific region central bankers in Shanghai . 
attempts by the People &apos;s Bank of China , the central bank , to regulate monetary supply and strengthen financial supervision had effectively standardised the country &apos;s financial markets operations , Chen said . 
the good first half performance would help China meet its target of eight-percent 1997 gross domestic product growth and confine inflation to within five percent , he said . 
China &apos;s economy grew at a 9.5-percent rate in the first half . 
retail inflation was a year-on-year 1.8 percent , down from 6.1 percent a year ago . 
China &apos;s main economic and financial problems included the state sector , unemployment and development of a social security system , Chen said . 
regulation and control of financial policies through macroeconomic development should be strengthened , and the issue of financial bonds needed further improvement in the latter half of the year , Xinhua quoted him as saying but gave no details .
