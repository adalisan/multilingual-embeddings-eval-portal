the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) said on Tuesday that a flare-up in fighting in Afghanistan between the Islamic Taleban militia and opposition forces was causing the humanitarian situation to deteriorate . 
in a press communique released in Geneva , the ICRC also criticised the authorities in opposition-held northern Afghanistan for denying the ICRC access to an estimated 3,000 prisoners of war . 
&quot; The ongoing fighting between the Northern Coalition and the Taleban in northern Afghanistan has prompted a major humanitarian alert and a marked increase in the emergency response of the International Committee of the Red Cross , &quot; says the communique . 
fighting flared north of Kabul in May when an opposition group under the former government &apos;s top military commander Ahmed Shah Masood broke out of his stronghold in the Panjsher valley in the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains to challenge the Taleban in the plains some 60 miles ( 100 km ) north of the Afghan capital . 
three weeks ago the opposition pushed the Taleban back to within 12 miles ( 20 km ) of Kabul . 
although there has been little change in the front lines , there have been sporadic attacks and fierce exchanges of artillery and rocket fire . 
the Red Cross says that it has treated some 7,000 war wounded on both sides of the front line in the last three months . 
&quot; We haven &apos;t had so many people wounded in a similar period over the last three years . 
there are clearly signs of an escalation in the conflict . 
&quot; said Thomas Gurtner , acting head of the ICRC in Afghanistan , on Tuesday . 
Gurtner said that he has noticed a deterioration in the control over fighters by the authorities . 
&quot; The ICRC is really worried about a general trend in Afghanistan where we feel there are more and more local initiatives taken which are not checked by the central authorities . 
we feel that the overall situation , especially for civilians is deteriorating , &quot; said Gurtner . 
&quot; The high authorities may accept that minimum respect is due , but they are facing increasing problems to discipline and ensure that lower ranks respect the basic principles of humanity . 
&quot; he said . 
the Red Cross communique also criticises opposition commanders for denying them access to some of the thousands of prisoners of war they are holding . 
&quot; Since May 1997 the ICRC has had access to and registered some 3,400 detained combatants and civilians . 
however , despite repeated representations , the organisation has been consistently denied access to an estimated 3,000 additional detainees held mainly in Faryab , Jawzjan , and Balkh provinces . 
&quot; The ICRC deplores this failure to comply with humanitarian principles and solemnly appeals to the relevant authorities in the north to respect their commitments and facilitate access to all places of detention under their control , &quot; says the communique . 
the provinces of Faryab , Jawzjan and Balkh are controlled by forces loyal to General Abdul Malik , leader of one of the partners in the tripartite anti-Taleban alliance . 
Malik joined the Taleban briefly in May , but turned on them and drove them from the alliance stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif . 
many Taleban were killed and many more captured , including the Taleban governor of the central bank and a provincial governor who were in Mazar at the time of the rebellion . 
Gurtner said that the ICRC is getting access to most of the detention centres in the strongholds of the other two member of the opposition alliance , Bamiyan in central Afghanistan , and the Panjsher valley . 
&quot; reasonable access is granted to us in Bamiyan and Panjsher and in Taleban-controlled areas , although there are problems there as well . 
we have taken them up with the concerned authorities , &quot; he said . 
a week ago , the Taleban lodged a protest with the ICRC and the United Nations over the opposition &apos;s refusal to allow them access to detained prisoners of war and accused the opposition of the murder and torture of detainees . 
Gurtner declined to comment on the allegations , but said that all such charges would be taken up with the relevant authorities . 
the Taleban have demanded the release of prisoners of war as a precondition for any peace talks . 
the opposition has refused , and say that any release should be negotiated as part of the talks . 
born in Islamic schools for Afghan war refugees living in neighbouring Pakistan , the Taleban quickly took control of most of the country , including Kabul , which it took in September . 
it has imposed strict interpretations of Islamic law in areas it has conquered .
