French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten cruised into the final of the Bologna international clay-court tournament with a crushing victory over Italian Marzio Martelli on Saturday . 
the 20-year old Brazilian , who is ranked 15 in the world after shooting up from 66th place following his French triumph , brushed aside his rival 6-1 6-2 . 
last Sunday &apos;s surprise French Open winner , who extended his winning run to 16 matches with Saturday &apos;s victory , now faces Spain &apos;s Felix Mantilla , who ranks just behind him at 16 . 
eighth seed Kuerten , who wrapped up the first set in 22 minutes after Martelli made three double-faults , dominated from the baseline in a 50-minute duel on the sun-baked clay-court where temperatures touched 32 Celsius ( 90 Fahrenheit ) . 
wearing a black and silver bandanna , Kuerten exuded quiet confidence in contrast to the inconsistent Italian who sprayed many balls beyond the baseline . 
second seed Mantilla defeated Morocco &apos;s Karim Alami 6-3 6-2 .
