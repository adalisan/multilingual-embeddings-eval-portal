CME live cattle futures were expected to open steady to 0.200 cent per lb lower while feeder cattle futures calls ranged from 0.100 cent lower to 0.100 higher , livestock analysts said . 
packers were expected to back away further from the fed cattle market following another decline in boxed beef values and expectations of slack meat demand after the holiday . 
packers have enough live inventory to start next week &apos;s kil , especially with contract cattle available , and fed cattle bids next week are seen no better than $ 62 per cwt , analysts said . 
some analysts look for carryover pressure in feeder cattle futures following expectations for higher corn futures and likely further technical correction . 
however , others again pointed to the rising feeder cattle index and continued tight feeder cattle supplies as buying factors . 
feeder numbers will remain light into the fall , they said . 
the latest CME feeder cattle index was up $ 0.10 to $ 80.67 per cwt , the highest level since April 19 , 1994 . 
they added that trading in both pits is expected to be light ahead of the long Independence Day holiday . 
markets will trade their normal hours .
