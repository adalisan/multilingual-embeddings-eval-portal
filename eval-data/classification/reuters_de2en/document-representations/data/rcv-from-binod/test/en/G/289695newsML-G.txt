a Philippine Air Force F-5 fighter jet crashed on Monday during a fly-past ceremony , killing its pilot and a man on the ground , the air force said . 
one other civilian on the ground , a boy , survived with serious injuries after the aircraft nose-dived into a river bank while taking off from BASA air base in Pampanga province just north of Manila , an air force spokesman said . 
the jet fighter was one of four F-5s on a fly-past over BASA air base at the start of a parade marking the handover of the air force &apos;s 5th Fighter wing to a new commander . 
but the aircraft , piloted by a lieutenant , failed to gain altitude after the low-level manoeuvre and crashed , bursting into flames and killing an elderly man walking on the river bank , the spokesman said . 
the accident occurred in full view of Philippine Air Force chief Major General William Hotchkiss III , who was guest at the handover ceremony . 
the aircraft was one of five F-5s acquired by the Philippines last year from the South Korean air force , which was phasing out the model , air force sources said . 
the cause of the crash has not been established . 
the sources said one aspect investigators were looking into was why the pilot failed to eject .
