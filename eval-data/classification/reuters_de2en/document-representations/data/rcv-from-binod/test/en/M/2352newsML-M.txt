Britain &apos;s FTSE 100 stock index , which sank to its lowest year level a month ago , chalked up a record closing high on Tuesday led by bullish retail sector sentiment . 
&quot; You probably couldn &apos;t have forecast a better background for the equity market than the one we &apos;ve currently got , &quot; said one senior share trader . 
&quot; The market has a lot going for it . 
the blue chip index closed 19.5 points higher at 3,883.2 , surpassing the previous 3,872.9 record it set just last week . 
gainers outweighed decliners by a margin of two to one but volume was a subdued 512.9 million shares as all eyes remained fixed on the outcome of the interest rate setting U.S. Federal Open Markets Committee , which was meeting as the London market closed . 
the retail stocks which led an early advance were boosted by the latest economic figures which flagged an improvement in British consumer sentiment . 
&quot; The consumer credit figures this morning showed another booming month -- the consumer is back with a vengeance , &quot; another trader said . 
but the return of the so-called &quot; feel-good factor &quot; in the retail sector may also reduce the likelihood of any further cuts in UK interest rates , traders said . 
this view was shared by Britain &apos;s largest mortgage lender , the Halifax Building Society . 
&quot; ( A rate cut ) would be more politically inspired than by the needs of the housing market , &quot; Halifax chairman Jon Foulds told reporters at the company &apos;s interim results &apos; presentation . 
leading the retail sector &apos;s advance , Gus was squeezed 23p higher to close at 663p , following the release of strong interim results from discount retailer Argos yesterday . 
on the back of the same wave of optimism , electronics retailer Dixons gained 11p to 535p and Kingfisher ended 14p higher at 668p , with dealers saying some investors anticipate more positive news from other half year results in the sector . 
whether the UK share market as a whole continues to go from strength to strength is largely dependent on events across the Atlantic , especially and the outcome of the FOMC policy meeting . 
&quot; We &apos;ve really seen little or no selling today , ( and ) most people are assuming there will be no change ( in U.S. rates ) , &quot; one senior dealer said . 
but trade remained cautious in the U.S. and the Dow was little changed , up 3.7 points , when London markets closed . 
&quot; We are still looking for reasurrance on U.S. rates , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; If they don &apos;t increase rates now , we want to know when are they likely to &quot; .
