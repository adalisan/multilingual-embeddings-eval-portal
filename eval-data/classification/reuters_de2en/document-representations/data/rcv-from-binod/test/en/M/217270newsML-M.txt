the ringgit was confined to a narrow range at the close of Kuala Lumpur due to a lack of interest and strong dollar / majors , dealers said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Dollar / ringgit is basically following the majors . 
the Japanese yen is down ( against dollar ) so the ringgit followed , &quot; said a dealer with a British bank in London . 
he said the ringgit was stuck in the 2.5200 / 80 a dollar range in the near-term . 
dealers said volumes were down in all regional currencies as players were winding down for the year . 
dealers in Singapore and Malaysia earlier said the ringgit could test 2.5280 , which if broken could trigger stop-loss sales and send the ringgit above 2.53 a dollar . 
&quot; ( Dollar ) buying interest will continue . 
dollar / ringgit could test 2.5280 today , &quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank in Kuala Lumpur . 
it was at 1.8004 / 24 per Singapore dollar against 1.8003 / 17 .
