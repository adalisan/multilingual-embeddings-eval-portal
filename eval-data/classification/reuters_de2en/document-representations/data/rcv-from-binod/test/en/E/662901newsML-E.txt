Polish inflation fell more than expected to 14.6 percent year-on-year in May and analysts were upbeat on future figures but most said credit action was likely to prevent the central bank from cutting interest rates soon . 
the Central Statistical Office ( Gus ) said on Monday that consumer prices grew 0.6 percent in May , against one-percent growth in April when the year-on-year rate was 15.3 percent . 
prices rose 6.6 percent in the January-May period , compared with a 10.3 percent rise in the corresponding period in 1996 . 
&quot; If the National Bank of Poland ( central bank ) lowered interest rates we could forget about reducing the pace of credit growth ... and I wouldn &apos;t count on it ( a rate-cut ) before the fourth quarter , &quot; said Krzysztof Rybinski of ING Bank . 
credit grew 13.3 percent to 10.7 billion zlotys in the first five months of the year . 
personal credit was up 19.8 percent to 2.3 billion in the January-May period , despite a very restrictive monetary policy and high real rates . 
Poland &apos;s broad money rose by 3.5 billion zlotys , or 2.4 percent , in May to 148 billion after a 2.3 percent rise in April . 
it grew 9.2 percent in the January-May period against 10.5 percent in the same period of last year . 
analysts said consumer price inflation was likely to keep gradually falling for the remainder of the year to end close to the government &apos;s 13 percent price growth target , helped by a probable food price fall in the summer season . 
&quot; The finance minister will always be more optimistic about inflation than banks , but year-on-year 14 percent is possible , as is single digit price growth in 1998 , &quot; said Jacek Lech , deputy chief dealer at Bank Handlowy SA . 
finance minister Marek Belka said earlier on Monday that the government may even revise down its inflation target for December of this year from 13 percent . 
a monthly Reuter poll of the 26 biggest banks showed their average prediction for year-on-year inflation at the end of 1997 was 14.62 percent , down from 14.93 percent predicted last month . 
some analysts said inflation might still rebound in the fourth quarter due to fast wage growth and possible food prices increases later in the year . 
many analysts said the central bank was right to keep interest rates on hold to curb fast credit growth and reduce the widening foreign trade gap . 
others said , however , that a wide spread between inflation and official interest rates should prompt the central bank to cut rates . 
&quot; I think such a large discrepancy between the tempo of price growth and interest rates on deposits and credits cannot be maintained any longer , &quot; said Tadeusz Chroscicki , chief analyst at the government-linked Centre for Strategic Studies . 
Chroscicki said he expected a rate-cut of about two percentage points within the next several months . 
Poland &apos;s official rates , at 25 percent for the Lombard and 22 percent for the discount rate , have not been reduced since July 1996 , when year-on-year inflation stood at 20.4 percent .
