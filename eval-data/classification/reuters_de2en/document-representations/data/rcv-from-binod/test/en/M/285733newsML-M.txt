NYMEX heating oil ended lower Friday after oil inventory data showed a significant build in distillate supply though resilience in crude &apos;s price kept heat off session lows . 
&quot; crude stayed mostly above $ 25.50 , and I think that prevented heat from going far , &quot; said John Bradberry , vice president at petroleum distributor Continental Ozark Inc in Arkansas . 
February heating oil settled off 0.82 cent at 71.29 cents a gallon while February crude ended off 10 cents a barrel at $ 25.59 . 
February gasoline succumbed to heat &apos;s losses , finishing off 0.40 cent a gallon at 70.70 cents . 
on Thursday , the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) said distillate stocks - which consist of heating oil and diesel - grew 2.47 million barrels for the week ended December 27 when traders had expected a build of less than one million barrels . 
&quot; The data didn &apos;t look all that good . 
we really need some sustained cold weather to hold heating oil up , &quot; said a trader in Cleveland . 
the National weather Service in its six to 10 day forecast called for normal to above normal temperatures in the U.S. Northeast , the largest heating oil market in the world . 
the API reported a build in crude stocks of 2.73 million barrels when traders had expected a stock draw while gasoline stocks fell 219,000 barrels compared to expectations of a build . 
despite the unexpectedly bearish build in crude stocks , Feb crude was buoyed by technical strength partly derived from its remaining above the spot 20-day moving average . 
crude retraced its losses from the session low of $ 25.35 , enabling prompt heat to rebound from its session low of 70.50 , right on Feb trendline support drawn from the December 11 low of 66.20 .
