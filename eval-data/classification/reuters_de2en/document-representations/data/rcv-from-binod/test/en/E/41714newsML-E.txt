UK average earnings , touted by many economists as the key British figure of the week , are forecast to hold steady at an annualised 3.75 percent in July . 
meanwhile , unemployment is expected to continue falling in August , with a consensus of economists &apos; forecasts looking for a 15,000 decline . 
although most economists did not expect a pick-up in earnings this time , the relentless fall in UK unemployment could put upward pressure on wages at some point . 
in July , unemployment dropped by an unexpectedly large 24,100 , taking the overall rate to 7.6 percent , its lowest level since March 1991 . 
David Philpotts , UK economist at Schroders , said weakness in manufacturing pay levels would offset upward wage pressures in the service sector , leaving underlying average earnings unchanged in July . 
&quot; Nevertheless , a rise in the underlying rate to four percent is probable over the autumn , &quot; he said . 
analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell also forecast a tick up in wage pressures , although not yet . 
&quot; A rise seems likely in coming months to four percent , particularly with economic growth accelerating , &quot; they said in a client note . 
as for shrinking jobless queues , economists did not see signs of that trend abating , although the net drop in unemployment will not be as drastic as last month &apos;s . 
&quot; Unemployment is expected to post another decline in August , largely due to recruitment in the service and retail sectors , &quot; Philpotts said . 
he added that the total number of vacancies at job centres is unlikely to be able to sustain the strength seen in July when the annual increase of 49,500 was the highest since 1987 . 
Nigel Richardson , head of bond research at Yamaichi International , said the jobless trend remains firmly downwards , but he was less concerned about that fuelling wage inflation . 
he backed the consensus forecast for a 15,000 fall in August . 
&quot; There &apos;s not really any evidence that the pressure is feeding through into wages , &quot; he said . 
indeed , he said the reverse could happen in the months ahead . 
&quot; Historically , there has been a strong correlation between headline inflation and wage levels . 
wage settlements could actually ease back in the months ahead . 
headline retail price inflation has dropped from 3.5 percent year-on-year in July 1995 to 2.2 percent last month . 
but Marian Bell , economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland , was less sanguine . 
she said underlying average earnings growth could push up to 4.0 percent this time around . 
unit wage costs , the third prong of Wednesday &apos;s labour force figures , are forecast to show growth of 3.3 percent for the three months to July versus the same period a year ago . 
Michael Saunders , UK economist at Salomon Brothers , said unit wage costs tend to fall when output rises and vice versa . 
given a 0.5-percent jump in manufacturing output in July , he said a fall in unit wage costs was expected . 
but he warned the figure tends to be dominated by cyclical swings and is unreliable as an inflation indicator .
