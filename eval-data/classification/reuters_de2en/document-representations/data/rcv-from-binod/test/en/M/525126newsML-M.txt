NYMEX electricity futures were called to open higher Monday , extending last week &apos;s gains tied to strong daily cash prices , air-conditioning demand in the Southwest and tight spot power supply in the Northwest . 
in over-the-counter business , May California-Oregon Border ( COB ) futures were quoted at $ 14.30-14.50 a megawatt hour ( MWh ) against Friday &apos;s settlement at $ 14.03 , while May Palo Verde ( PV ) at $ 18.00-18.15 versus Friday &apos;s close of $ 17.50 . 
&quot; I &apos;m looking for a place to top out , &quot; one New York futures broker cautioned as May power futures approach their expiration Thursday . 
the spot contracts have been in an upchannel for a month . 
spot cash prices at COB and PV , which have been traded at sharp premiums above May forward prices are showing signs of easing as heat in the Southwest is predicted to dissipated by the middle of this week , market sources said . 
spot power availability in the West has been lowered by a number of planned and unplanned plant outages . 
as expected , the 1,087 megawatt ( MW ) Diablo Canyon nuclear unit 1 , in Avila Beach , California , was idled Saturday for a 36-day refueling and maintenance outage . 
the 1,080 MW San Onofre 3 nuclear power unit remained down for refueling , with an expected restart date in late June . 
the 1,158 MW WNP-2 nuclear plant in Washington state was also shut for refueling , and was expected to resume power output in early July . 
hydroelectric output in Northwest has been running relatively low in recent weeks due to a slower-than-normal snowmelt and spillage on the Snake and Columbia Rivers . 
about 6,000 MW of thermal generating capacity was off-line in the West for planned and unplanned maintenance , as well as hydropower displacement sales , but some of the capacity is expected to return to service later this week . 
forecasters expect temperatures in the Southwest would run average six to 12 degrees Fahrenheit today and Tuesday , and moderate to near normal levels for the rest of the week . 
readings in the Northwest would run three to six degrees F above normal through tomorrow with chance of rain , and cool to near normal levels Wednesday through Friday .
