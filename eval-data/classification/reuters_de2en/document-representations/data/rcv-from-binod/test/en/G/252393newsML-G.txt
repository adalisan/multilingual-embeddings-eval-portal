a winter storm will likely blanket the southern and central U.S. Plains with snow early next week , followed by bitterly cold temperatures , weather forecasters said Thursday . 
&quot; There &apos;s going to be a major winter storm developing early next week in the Southwest ( United States ) , which could affect all of the southern and central Plains , followed by bitter arctic air , &quot; said Dave Dusik , meteorologist with The weather Center Co in Kansas City . 
&quot; It looks like even as early as Monday , we could have something big going on in Kansas and Oklahoma , &quot; Dusik said . 
Fred Gesser , chief forecaster at weather Express in Omaha , Neb . , said that the storm would likely bring several inches of snow to the High Plains . 
&quot; We &apos;re looking at a possibility of fairly wet conditions -- three to five inches of snow -- in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles up through the central Plains , &quot; Gesser said . 
&quot; There will be heavier amounts in some areas . 
Gesser said an ensuing arctic blast would likely drive temperatures in the southern and central Plains into the single digits Fahrenheit by Wednesday morning . 
areas of Nebraska could see temperatures fall below zero F , he said . 
&quot; The important part is that it &apos;s going to get very , very cold during and after the storm , &quot; Dusik said . 
Gesser said it was still unclear how the storm would progress after hitting the Plains . 
he said the most recent meteorological models showed the storm following a course from Amarillo to Chicago . 
&quot; It &apos;s not only going to affect the cattle , it &apos;s going to affect the piggies out in Iowa , with single-digit lows likely in much of Iowa by Thursday morning , &quot; Gesser said .
