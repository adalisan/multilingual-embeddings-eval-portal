the Indonesian government is keeping a tight grip on the electoral process despite assured victory for the ruling Golkar party as the country heads towards general elections at the end of May . 
&quot; The government appears to be fairly confident that they &apos;ve got the electoral thing sewn up -- over 70 percent for Golkar , &quot; a senior Western diplomat said on Wednesday . 
but a series of riots over the past three months , including extensive ethnic violence in West Kalimantan province , shook the establishment despite the lack of any apparent guiding force behind the disturbances . 
political analysts have blamed the outbreaks on socio-economic tensions among the mainly Moslem poor , including disillusionment with a judiciary seen as not providing justice , and corruption in the local police forces and bureaucracy . 
despite an overall statistical drop in the poverty level , there is also dissatisfaction that the country &apos;s burgeoning economic wealth is not trickling down to the lower levels . 
&quot; The level of anger against the police is so clear , &quot; commentator , activist and government critic Goenawan Muhammad said this week . 
&quot; The riots have different motives in different places ... 
I think social conditions are such that any small conflict will tear down the community , &quot; he told a foreign correspondents &apos; meeting . 
the military , meanwhile , has said it would crack down on further disturbances , although some diplomats feel it faces a dilemma in how to deal with Moslem rioters while avoiding the re-creation of a repressive image . 
analyst Dewi Fortuna Anwar told Reuters there were &quot; worrying signs about social tensions that need to be addressed &quot; . 
but she added that riots so far had been away from Jakarta . 
&quot; It &apos;s when the conflicts are in the capital itself that you have to look out , &quot; she said . 
authorities have issued strict guidelines for the April 29 to May 23 campaigning for the concurrent national , provincial and local elections . 
then there will be a week during which electioneering is banned ahead of the voting on May 29 . 
political analysts say while Golkar is assured of victory , the interest lies in the percentage of the vote it gets and the number of spoiled ballots that may be cast as a protest vote . 
local media reported on Wednesday the military had seized at least 6,000 pamphlets urging people to boycott the elections and was searching for those responsible for producing the material . 
only three parties are permitted to contest the elections : Golkar , the Moslem-oriented United Development Party ( PPP ) and the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) . 
in the last elections in 1992 , Golkar took 68 percent of the vote on a 90 percent turnout of the electorate , the PPP 17 percent and the PDI 15 percent . 
political analysts say the government has effectively sidetracked the PDI , which is riven by dissension following the ousting of its leader Megawati Sukarnoputri by government-backed party rebels last year . 
political commentators also play down the significance of the May elections in that nothing is likely to change after the ballots are counted . 
the major interest is focused on the March 1998 meeting of a 1,000-member electoral college , the People &apos;s Consultative Assembly , which will choose the president and vice-president for a five-year term . 
President Suharto , 75 , has ruled the world &apos;s fourth most populous nation of 200 million people for 30 years . 
he is widely expected to seek a seventh term next year . 
the key question of a potential successor , however , remains up in the air .
