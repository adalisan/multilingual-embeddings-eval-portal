the Singapore economy will recover from its recent slowdown and grow by 7.5 percent to eight percent annually over the next two years , the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) said in a report released on Thursday . 
the Manila-based ADB said Singapore &apos;s growth eased last year largely as a result of a global slowdown in demand for electronics and computer products . 
the sectors account for about half the island &apos;s industrial output and almost 60 percent of its non-oil exports . 
but the growth rate should recover in the short term as surplus inventory in the electronics industry works itself out . 
&quot; The outlook for Singapore in the next two years is for GDP ( gross domestic product ) growth to pick up , to around 7.5 percent in 1997 , and to around eight percent in 1998 , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; However , over the longer term , more modest growth can be expected as the economy matures , &quot; it said . 
the Singapore economy expanded by seven percent in 1996 after 8.8 percent growth in 1995 and double-digit growth in the previous two years . 
the Ministry of Trade and Industry has predicted a growth rate of five to seven percent for 1997 . 
the ADB said the main policy challenge facing Singapore was its need to move to more sophisticated economic activities in sectors such as manufacturing and traded services . 
such moves could allow the island to take advantage of its position as a regional business centre but would not be affected by its rising costs . 
Singapore government agencies had already identified a number of manufacturing processes which they hoped to attract in greater numbers , including electronics , petrochemicals , precision engineering and chemicals . 
government agencies were encouraging investment by foreign companies by risk-sharing and helping with training . 
&quot; These , and related technology and education policies , will be critical to ensuring that Singapore maintains its momentum as a fully modernised , high-income economy , albeit one in which the pace of economic growth is somewhat slower than in the past , &quot; the report concluded .
