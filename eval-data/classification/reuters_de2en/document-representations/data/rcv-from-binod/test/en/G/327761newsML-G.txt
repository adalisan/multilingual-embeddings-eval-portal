Parliament in Ukraine &apos;s Crimean peninsula voted on Thursday to form a new government by February 5 , reflecting a growing political conflict in the autonomous , largely ethnic Russian region . 
the move , initiated by a pro-Moscow group of deputies , was clearly aimed at removing regional prime minister Arkady Demidenko , who is backed by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma . 
Parliament decided by 52 votes to 19 to make the government an acting one to allow a new team to be elected . 
the document said deputies were falling in line with the Ukrainian constitution , approved in June , by forming a &quot; Council of Ministers &quot; to replace the present government . 
but critics of the move said the deputies were playing with the wording of the constitution for their own ends . 
Demidenko told deputies the decision was illegal and that he would protest to Kuchma and the constitutional court . 
he later told reporters that his opponents in parliament had &quot; self-interested , mercenary goals &quot; . 
he accused them of merely seeking to win cabinet posts for themselves in the new Council . 
the Ukrainian constitution says the head of government in Crimea is appointed and sacked by the region &apos;s parliament with the president &apos;s agreement . 
Kuchma &apos;s press service said earlier he would not accept Demidenko &apos;s dismissal . 
Crimea has a population of 2.7 million and was part of Russia for nearly two centuries until the Kremlin gave it to Ukraine , then a former Soviet republic , as a &quot; gift &quot; in 1954 .
