Wellington , Jan 16 - Wellington captain Roger Twose admitted Wellington &apos;s weaknesses were exposed during Wednesday &apos;s dismal 123-run loss to Canterbury in the Shell Cup limited overs cricket final at the Basin Reserve , NZPA reports . 
responding to Canterbury &apos;s meagre total of 204 for seven wickets , Wellington were all out for 81 in the 34th over . 
that paltry total is only succeeded in miserableness by the 66 they scored against Canterbury in the first round of this summer &apos;s competition , also at the Basin Reserve . 
however , Twose didn &apos;t think the Wellington side choked . 
&quot; Canterbury bowled very well and they are a far better side than us on paper , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But there are areas of strengths and weaknesses in our side and I think they were exposed , &quot; he said . 
Wellington played some outstanding cricket to reach the final , and twice beat Canterbury at Lancaster Park , but too often they got home through the batting efforts of one player in a game -- generally Phil Chandler , Jason Wells or Roger Twose . 
they were the only players to manage a degree of consistency in their batting , although Scott Weenink managed one century and Robbie Kerr a half-century . 
however that was the sum total of Wellington &apos;s excellence , and when a combination as powerful as Canterbury needs to be beaten in a final , all those resources had to fire . 
they didn &apos;t , and Wellington paid a humiliating price . 
Canterbury &apos;s players occasionally appeared under-awed during the qualifying rounds -- they have been to the Shell Cup final five times in the last six years -- but when the final came around the competitive fires were burning again and Wellington weren &apos;t in the hunt . 
even while pressured by the only two consistent bowlers , Gavin Larsen and Mark Jefferson , during the middle stages of the innings , Canterbury kept driving ahead . 
Wellington , by comparison , looked to have hit a brick wall , ending up concussed and unable to think of what to do next . 
while successful captain Lee Germon felt his side had enough runs on the pitch , he still needed his bowlers to make an early impact . 
&quot; We knew we could defend the total if we got early wickets . 
&quot; We knew also that Phil Chandler and Roger Twose were the key wickets . 
if we could do the job against them we would get right among Wellington , &quot; he said . 
as it was Chandler repeated his first-over dismissal from the washed-out day on Tuesday to enter the sports trivia books by being the only player out twice in the one-day final for a duck . 
Twose , despite a valiant approach in scoring 24 , couldn &apos;t find the support to stick around with him . 
at one stage Wellington was four wickets down for nine runs . 
Germon said : &quot; The pitch dried out a lot from Tuesday but I didn &apos;t expect it to slow up as much as it did . 
&quot; I think when a stroke player like Chris Cairns spends 77 balls scoring 42 , it says something about the pitch , &quot; Germon said .
