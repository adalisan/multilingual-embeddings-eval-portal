French winger David Ginola completed an estimated two million pounds ( $ 3.4 million ) move from Newcastle to Tottenham on Tuesday and hoped the transfer will boost his chance of playing in next year &apos;s World Cup finals . 
after the London premier league club announced he had signed a four-year contract , Ginola said he still wanted to try to regain the national squad . 
&quot; My choice this season was a little bit based on the World Cup next season , &quot; he said . 
&quot; signing for Tottenham , I really think that it is a great chance for me . 
&quot; I think it is very important for me to play well all next season . 
my big aim is to win something with the club this season and to be involved in Europe the season after . 
Ginola , who joined Newcastle from Paris St Germain two years ago , had been unable to hold down a regular first team place since Kenny Dalglish took over as manager from Kevin Keegan last season . 
he will fill the gap left at Tottenham by the departure of England striker Teddy Sheringham to Manchester United last month . 
Tottenham manager Gerry Francis made it clear that Ginola was not his last signing before the start of the new season next month . 
&quot; David has always caused us problems and I am delighted we have him here as he has proved himself in English football , &quot; explained Francis . 
&quot; And I will be adding to the squad with at least another two players .
