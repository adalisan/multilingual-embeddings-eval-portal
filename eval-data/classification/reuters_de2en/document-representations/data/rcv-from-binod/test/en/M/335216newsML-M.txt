trading for the week ended on a steady note , with a gain of 13.27 points ( 0.39 percent ) at 3435.62 levels over the previous week , with an intra-week high of 3478.63 . 
a majority of the pivotals tracked after Friday &apos;s closing shows that the rise on Friday has been on declining volume , exhibiting that the minor rally from 3342.89 may sustain at best till Tuesday . 
the trend following oscillators fail to confirm the sustainability of the minor trend , the intermediate trend which has been classified to be up , will become healthy with the correction that may last for three trading days . 
after the formation of the minor bottom at 3334-3265 ( 31 January , 1997 ) , the Sensex may set triggers for the pre-budget rally . 
this pre-budget swing may lose momentum at 3570-3650 levels . 
the cycle theory depicts the Change in trend ( CIT ) is due and may occur on 27 / 28 January 1997 . 
the mechanical oscillators in conjunction with the volume justify that the top may be formed at 3465-3487 . 
as per the time cycle theory , the Sensex may move into the CIT , time window on Monday . 
hopefully , an upday is formed on Monday . 
an upday is said to be formed when the Sensex makes a higher high and a higher low with respect to the previous day &apos;s range of movement . 
an upday formation on Monday would result in a clear three days trend running into the time zone . 
and if this were to happen then a minor top formation cannot be ruled out . 
the greater the number of clusters terminating on the CIT , date more powerful the turn date becomes . 
anything above eight clusters is considered high . 
the price following oscillators on the weekly bar chart are exhibiting that the top may be formed at 3465-3487 levels - relative Strength Index ( 14 RSI ) is 56.85 , Price Rate of Change ( 12 Roc ) is placed at -5.69 , short term stochastic is hovering at 70.37 and its trigger line is at 74.23 , while the medium term stochastic is 73.09 and the trigger is 63.31 , the Macd is -31.01 and its trigger is -91.74 , the price oscillator is 4.03 and the 14 William &apos;s percent R is placed at -34.27 . 
for the current week , the BSE Sensex in the upmove may encounter resistance at 3465 , 3485 and 3510 levels , on the lower end it may find support at 3334 , 3279 and at the 200 weeks &apos; average at 3203.78 level . 
the National Index may witness profit booking at 1526-1549 level and support at 1480 and 1439 level .
