the financial failure of another steel company dampened South Korea &apos;s domestic base metal demand on Thursday , traders said . 
Sammi Steel Co defaulted on debts of 1.8 billion and local banks reacted by freezing its checking accounts . 
on Tuesday , Sammi Steel sought protection from its creditors along with four other affiliates of the Sammi Group , one of the nation &apos;s top 30 conglomerates . 
the domestic metal industry feared the Sammi Group failure would lead to a financial crisis , the traders said . 
&quot; Sammi &apos;s troubles have already pushed interest rates higher and sent the won tumbling against the dollar , &quot; a trader with Taihan Electric Wire Co Ltd said . 
the trader said Sammi &apos;s collapse was another blow to an economy already shaken by the Hanbo Steel debacle . 
Hanbo went belly up in January under the weight of loans of USS $ 5.8 billion and its failure sparked a loans-for-kickback scandal that shook Korea . 
on Wednesday , yields on three-year corporate bonds rose to a new 18-month high of 12.85 percent as Sammi &apos;s woes strained the already tight money market , brokers said . 
the won also ended lower on Wednesday at 884.80 won to the U.S. dollar , propelled by concerns about a further tightening of overseas credit to domestic companies and fears over lower supplies of the dollar , dealers said . 
Meanwhlie , aluminium import premiums for spot delivery were seen by the trade as unchanged at a range of $ 85- $ 90 a tonne CIF Pusan over LME cash prices . 
domestic aluminium prices fell to 1.51 million won a tonne from 1.53 million won the previous week , while copper prices were flat at 2.297 million won a tonne . 
the domestic zinc price was flat at 1.187 million won a tonne while lead prices were also unchanged at 703,000 won a tonne . 
traders said the Office of Supply would buy 2,550 tonnes of aluminium through tenders late on Thursday . 
they said delivery was set for the four warehouses in the cities of Inchon ( 1,285 tonnes ) , Pusan ( 530 tonnes ) , Taegu ( 560 tonnes ) and Kwangju ( 175 tonnes ) .
