Arab foreign ministers recommended on Sunday that their countries suspend steps towards normal relations with Israel , ministers said . 
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and Palestinian leader Farouk Kaddoumi told reporters that the same resolution also recommended restoring the Arab boycott of Israel 
the ministers said the resolution passed unanimously on Sunday evening at the second session of a regular six-monthly meeting at Arab League headquarters . 
the final text was not immediately available but a draft in circulation earlier recommended Arab states stop normalisation , reactivate the boycott , close down Israeli offices and missions and withdraw from multilateral Middle East talks . 
Shara , asked if the boycott was in the text , said : &quot; Yes , yes , clearly ... 
it is clearer and stronger and it has been adopted unanimously . 
Kaddoumi said : &quot; They ( the ministers ) have emphasised their boycott at the first degree . 
&quot; The first-degree boycott , abandoned by same Arab states over the past three years , bans direct commercial dealings with Israeli companies . 
but he added that the ministers did not talk about countries which have signed peace treaties with Israel . 
Israel could interpret breaking relations as a violation of the treaties .
