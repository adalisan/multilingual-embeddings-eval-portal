U.S. treasuries traded in London were wary ahead of key economic data this week , although the underlying tone was firm , traders in London said on Monday . 
however , after recent rises the market remains sensitive to shocks -- particularly if retail sales data due on Tuesday come in above expectations . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very important week for treasuries , &quot; said Adam Chester , international bond strategist at Yamaichi International in London . 
&quot; If there &apos;s a bounce back in June sales , and an upward revision in May , treasuries could be very vulnerable . 
the U.S. 30-year long bond was trading at 101-02 , yielding 6.543 percent , compared with 101-03 in Tokyo and 101-08 at the New York close . 
September T-bonds were at 114-02 down 2 / 32 in automated trade . 
traders said the bull market appeared as yet undisturbed , despite recent strenuous rises . 
&quot; This is a clear and distinct bull market , we &apos;ll see a sprint to higher prices , &quot; said Bill Westgate , vice president at HSBC . 
&quot; The fundamental environment is as good as you could ever ask for . 
he said any period of consolidation was part of a cycle of rising and consolidating prices , rather than a prelude to a decline . 
he noted good fundamentals , with six consecutive declines in wholesale inflation and robust economic growth . 
Chester at Yamaichi was less sanguine , pointing out that retail sales data were notoriously volatile . 
he said a rise of 1.0 percent in the headline rate could spur expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve could put up interest rates at its August policy meeting . 
&quot; If a rate hike is talked about then we may see a loss of a point or more , &quot; he said . 
a Reuters poll forecast June retail sales to rise 0.2 percent , and 0.5 percent ex-autos . 
Chester was expecting 0.4 and 0.6 percent respectively . 
but a weak figure could be the impetus needed to push the yield on the long-bond through the key 6.5 percent level , heading for 6.25 percent .
