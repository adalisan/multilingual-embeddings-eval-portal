the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday it wants to deport a 75-year-old Lithuanian immigrant suspected of involvement in a security force that enforced anti-Jewish laws during World War Two . 
the United States contends that the man , Algimantas Dailide , concealed his ties to the security force , &quot; Saugumas , &quot; on immigration documents in 1950 . 
the man &apos;s lawyer denied that his client persecuted or arrested Jews and said he will appeal a U.S. court ruling this week that paved the way for deportation proceedings . 
Dailide now lives in Brecksville , a Cleveland suburb , and owns a real estate business , said his lawyer , Joseph McGinness . 
judge Paul Matia of U.S. District Court in Cleveland said in his ruling that when Dailide immigrated to the United States , he told authorities he had not been affiliated with a police force that assisted occupying Germans . 
justice Department investigators said there was evidence that Dailide was with the security force and that he participated in at least two arrests of Jews in wartime Lithuania . 
McGinness said when Dailide came to the United States to work in a Cleveland factory , he told immigration authorities he had been a forester in his homeland .
