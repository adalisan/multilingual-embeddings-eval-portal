Vietnam &apos;s decade-old reform drive has brought huge social and economic rewards , but policy-makers must go further to tackle the danger of a rapidly widening trade gap , a United Nations report said on Tuesday . 
&quot; On the basis of most broad macro-economic and social indicators , Vietnam &apos;s performance in recent years has been quite remarkable ... , &quot; the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) said . 
but the report , released before a key donors &apos; meeting in Hanoi early next month , said rapid progress had thrown up new and more complex challenges . 
&quot; On the surface , the biggest challenge facing Vietnam at present is the recent emergence of a large external trade deficit , &quot; it said . 
&quot; However ... the large trade deficit appears to be only a symptom of more fundamental underlying problems . 
the communist country notched up a record trade deficit of about $ 3.25 billion in the first nine months of this year . 
that was already close to a 50 percent increase over the deficit for all of 1995 , itself a record , and represented 19.4 percent of gross domestic product . 
the UNDP , arguing that annual import growth of nearly 40 percent a year was &quot; not financially sustainable and must slow down &quot; , said there was no short cut to solving the problem of a big trade deficit and the debt that it piles up . 
it said the government &apos;s answer to the problem had been to use administrative controls such as restrictions on deferred letters of credit , essentially restricting borrowing for imports . 
&quot; A lasting solution will require more fundamental reforms , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; Unless strong export growth is maintained and slower import growth is encouraged , the burden of deficits in the next few years will create a debt and repayment burden that will limit the ability of the economy to continue growing rapidly . 
the UNDP recommended more rapid trade liberalisation , deeper reform of state-owned enterprises , the promotion of a healthy and vibrant non-state sector , a market-oriented exchange rate and caution on incurring new debt on commercial terms . 
the U.N. report came on the heels of a study by the World Bank , which praised the management of an economy whose annual growth rate has averaged 8.2 percent over the past five years . 
however , the Bank also highlighted the threat of widening trade and current account gaps and , among other recommendations , said the country &apos;s currency should be allowed to reflect market forces to ensure that its exports remain competitive . 
the central State Bank of Vietnam last Friday slightly widened the official exchange fluctuation band for the currency , the Dong , leaving room for it to slip against the U.S. dollar . 
both reports will serve as a guide for donor nations and agencies when they meet to discuss next year &apos;s aid allocation for Vietnam on December 5-6 . 
donors have become increasingly sympathetic to Hanoi since the leadership embarked on the reform process and a more open-door foreign policy in the late 1980s . 
aid commitments came to $ 1.8 billion in 1993 , $ 1.9 billion in 1994 and $ 2.31 billion last year . 
diplomats said a sum similar to last year &apos;s was expected to be pledged at next month &apos;s meeting .
