Natsteel Ltd said on Thursday the group suffered an extraordinary loss of Singapore $ 65.73 million in the first half of 1996 from the restructuring of its local steel operations . 
the extraordinary loss was partially offset by an extraordinary gain of S $ 35.73 million realised from the sale of an investment property , Natsteel said in its interim results . 
it also made a gain of S $ 169,000 from the sale of long-term investments . 
the extraordinary item led the group to report a S $ 13.75 million loss after tax and extraordinary items attributable to shareholders . 
the directors said they believe the positive effects of the restructuring exercise for the Singapore mill will be felt in 1997 .
