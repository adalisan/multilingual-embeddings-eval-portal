Russia &apos;s Nizhny Novgorod region plans to issue its debut Eurobond in September after it has registered the issue prospectus with the Finance Ministry , a regional official said on Thursday . 
&quot; We shall make the issue in September , as soon as we register the prospectus with the Finance Ministry , &quot; securities issue department head Yuri Podlesov told Reuters .

Nizhny Novogorod is one of the three Russian territories , which President Boris Yeltsin has authorised to issue Eurobonds .
