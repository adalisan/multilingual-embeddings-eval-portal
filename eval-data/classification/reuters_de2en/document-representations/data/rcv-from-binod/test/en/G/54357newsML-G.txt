Italian sprinters once again dominated the Tour of Spain in Sunday &apos;s ninth stage but had no illusions about staying on top when the race resumes after Monday &apos;s rest day and moves into the moutains . 
both stage winner Nicola Minali and overall leader Fabio Baldato recognise that their time in the spotlight is up . 
Minali was similarly realistic after outsprinting the rest of the pack to take his third stage , the second in two days . 
before then the Vuelta moves from the shallow hills of the south coast to the steep climbs of northern Castile . 
the rest day will come as a welcome break after nine stages -- all decided right on the finish line -- from which no clear leader has emerged . 
Sunday &apos;s stage escaped the bad weather which had killed off breakaway attempts throughout the opening week . 
with the sun shining , much of the 162 kilometres between Jerez and Cordoba was ridden in a carnival atmosphere as entire villages turned out to pay tribute to Spanish hero Miguel Indurain . 
Indurain has not ridden the Vuelta since 1991 , the year he shot to prominence by winning the first of five tours de France . 
Minali again emerged at the front , timing his break to beat German rider Marcel Wust and Belgian Tom steels . 
Tuesday &apos;s stage is a 46-km time-trial from El Tiemblo to Avila .
