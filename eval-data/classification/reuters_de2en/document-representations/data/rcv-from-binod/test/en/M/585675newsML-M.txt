gold prices snapped briefly and narrowly higher on Thursday afternon after German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said his country would not sell a single ounce of gold . 
gold closed in London at $ 346.70 / $ 347.20 per ounce down $ 1.70 from Wednesday after a bounce of less than a dollar immediately after Waigel &apos;s statement . 
he also said the Bundesbank &apos;s gold reserves of around 95 million ounces should be revalued closer to the market price of 600 marks per ounce rather than their bookkeeping value of 144 marks per ounce . 
reports of the German proposals surfaced overnight and knocked about $ 2.00 per ounce off the gold price in New York . 
Germany was forecast to face a budget deficit of around 18 billion marks in 1997 . 
revaluing its gold reserves would be one way of plugging the gap . 
however a weaker dollar encouraged buying of the yellow metal early on Thursday allowing it to fix down a dollar at $ 348.10 in a market which was nervous and concerned about the German thinking . 
gold dealers were far from sanguine after Waigel &apos;s statement later in the afternoon . 
some referred to the &quot; no sale &quot; statement as a short term buy but a long term selling opportunity . 
&quot; You wouldn &apos;t buy gold on the basis of this unless you were short and had to cover anyway , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The fact that they are talking about gold is bad enough . 
a few years ago this would have knocked $ 20- $ 30 off the price , &quot; the dealer added . 
Gernmany has long been one of the staunchest advocates of holding gold in reserves as an anti-inflation instrument . 
it has vociferously opposed proposals by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to sell part of its gold reserves to finance an aid fund for the world &apos;s poorest countries on the basis that it would send the wrong signals to the market . 
gold prices have been depressed for months under threat of European central banks selling from reserves as they tried to Stear their economies through the Maastricht Treaty criteria for entry to European Monetary Union due at the end of next year . 
in January the Dutch central bank ended months of speculation when it announced it had sold 300 tonnes of gold late last year although any respite for depressed market was short lived and the gold prices dipped to its lowestin four years in February before settling uncertainly around current levels .
