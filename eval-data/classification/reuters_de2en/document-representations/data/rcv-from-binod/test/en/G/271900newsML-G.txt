Marcello Mastroianni returned home on Saturday as emotion-choked fans and friends of the legendary Italian actor greeted the arrival of his body from Paris , where he died on Thursday . 
a small group of people , some battling to hold back tears , watched the actor &apos;s coffin emerge from a jet after a commercial flight from Paris , where Mastroianni died in his apartment from cancer aged 72 . 
Mastroianni &apos;s friends , the borthers Franco and Sergio Citti , a film director , his manager Giovanna Cau and some 50 other fans and friends waved handkerchiefs and cheered as the coffin was loaded onto a hearse . 
&quot; Mastroianni was my best friend and part of me has gone with him , &quot; Citti told reporters . 
the coffin , drapped in a grey cloth with three red roses on top , will lie in state at Rome &apos;s Capitoline city hall until the civil funeral on Sunday at the family &apos;s tomb at Rome &apos;s Verrano cemetery . 
Mastroianni , who starred in some 160 films opposite some of cinema &apos;s most beautiful women including 12 with Sophia Loren , was Italy &apos;s quintessential Latin lover . 
he was perhaps best known for playing alongside Swedish beauty Anita Ekberg in Federico Fellini &apos;s classic &quot; La dolce vita &quot; ( The sweet Life ) .
