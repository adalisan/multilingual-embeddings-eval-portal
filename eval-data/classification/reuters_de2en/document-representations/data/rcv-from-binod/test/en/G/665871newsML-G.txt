the southern African economic bloc of 12 states should unite in the battle against AIDS in one of the world &apos;s worst affected regions , the EU &apos;s South Africa ambassador Erwan Fouere said on Tuesday . 
speaking at the presentation of two EU-sponsored research documents on the integration of HIV / AIDS into development by the University of Natal &apos;s economic development unit , Fouere said the outlook was grim for the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) . 
United Nations figures showed 14 million people in sub- Saharan Africa had Acquired immune deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) 
the statistics are very alarming , and because the frontiers are so porous and the migratory movements are so enormous it is very difficult to control the increase of infections , &quot; Fouere said . 
&quot; It will make much more sense for the region to get together to deal with the problem than if each country dealt with it individually . 
I think it is about time because this is an issue that has been confronting us and is getting worse and worse , &quot; he said . 
the research , which took over two years , investigated ways of integrating HIV / AIDS into development planning by national and provincial governments and business , said Alan Whiteside of the university &apos;s economic research unit . 
Whiteside said ante-natal testing in Botswana and Zimbabwe showed that over 30 percent of pregnant women in major centres were HIV positive . 
about six percent of South Africans , or some 2.5 million people , had AIDS and would die . 
&quot; In practice , the net cost to the economy will be virtually impossible to quantify . 
much will depend on the way in which the economy responds to the inevitable changes in relative prices . 
&quot; Eventhough the net effect of these changes cannot be accurately documented , it is clear there will be an adverse impact , &quot; the research documents said .
