Dutch shipping and road transport group Koninklijke Nedlloyd on Wednesday announced a trebling of first quarter losses , but forecast a profit on ordinary activities for the full year with faster than expected savings from its P &amp; O Nedlloyd joint venture . 
Nedlloyd &apos;s net losses from ordinary activties fell to 45 million guilders ( $ 23.9 million ) , from 15 million in the first quarter last year . 
however , 1996 &apos;s figure included a 30 million guilder capital gain on the sale of vessels , without which losses would have been the same . 
the result was at the bottom end of analyst forecasts and well below the consensus 17 million guilder loss . 
shares in Nedlloyd , which have gained over 10 percent in a week , equalled a two month high of 50.30 guilders on Wednesday morning ahead of the results , but subsided to 48.20 guilders , 60 cents down on the day , by 1335 GMT . 
the loss was the result of a weak performance in ocean shipping , hit by eight percent year-on-year tariff erosion . 
Nedlloyd &apos;s share in the P &amp; O Nedlloyd first quarter loss was 38 million guilders , compared with a 33 million loss ( excluding capital gains ) in its Ocean Shipping division a year earlier . 
but cost savings in this sector were expected to ensure profits for the whole of 1997 . 
&quot; Based on our current knowledge ... we expect Nedlloyd as a whole to achieve a positive result on ordinary activities in 1997 , &quot; the company said in a statement with the results , although it said it was too early to give a specific projection . 
the savings are to be realised in the company &apos;s P &amp; O Nedlloyd joint venture with Britain &apos;s Peninsular and Oriental steam Navigation Co . Nedlloyd said it expected the joint venture to contribute positively during 1997 . 
&quot; Progress is ahead of schedule for merging the previous businesses into the new company . 
on an annualised basis , savings of $ 200 million will be achieved by Q4 1997 , &quot; P &amp; O Nedlloyd said in a statement issued at the same time as the Nedlloyd results . 
&quot; Merger costs will fall largely in Q2-Q4 1997 with synergy savings increasing through 1997 and into 1998 . 
total annual synergy will comfortably exceed the $ 200 million originally forecast , &quot; it added . 
excluding ocean shipping , the group made a profit of 13 million guilders , up from 10 million . 
net turnover moved ahead to 851 million guilders from 804 million . 
analysts mostly agreed that the size of the losses was a surprise , agreed a turnaround in container shipping provided the key to profitability for the full year , but were mixed on the prospects . 
&quot; ( profits ) were clearly at the bottom end of the range , but they expect savings to be higher . 
in such a cyclical industry , it &apos;s quite a brave statement ... I think they will probably manage it , &quot; said Pieter van Gelder of Delta Lloyd Bank . 
&quot; It &apos;s a positive view , but we don &apos;t share that view . 
( shipping ) capacity will increase substantially and world trade growth will not keep up , &quot; said Oscar Poos of Paribas Capital Markets .
