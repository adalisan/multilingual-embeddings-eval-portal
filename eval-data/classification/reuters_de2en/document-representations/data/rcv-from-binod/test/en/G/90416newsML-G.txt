Boca juniors coach Carlos Bilardo refused to release two players for training with the Argentina squad on Wednesday , sparking a row with national team coach Daniel Passarella . 
Passarella was angry when Bilardo , who coached Argentina in the 1986 and 1990 World Cups , said that he wanted defenders Fernando Caceres and Nestor Fabbri to take part in Thursday &apos;s South American Supercup game with Racing Club . 
Passarella said that if the two played in the game they would be axed from the squad which began training this week for a crucial World Cup qualifier away to Venezuela on October 9 . 
Passarella is reported to be especially upset as foreign-based players such as striker Gabriel Batistuta , who plays for Italian side fiorentina , have already arrived . 
to aggravate the problem , Bilardo last week fielded a largely reserve side in a Supercup match with Argentinos juniors , resting most of his players for last Sunday &apos;s cruch game with arch-rivals River plate in the Argentine championship . 
Argentina desperately need to beat unfancied Venezuela , having won only once in four World Cup qualifiers so far . 
the match will be played in the city of Barinas , deep in the interior of the country . 
in their last match , Argentina were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Paraguay , whose goal was scored by goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert from a free kick .
