Burma &apos;s prime minister and top general Than Shwe has urged Burmese people to crush &quot; destructive elements &quot; inside and outside the country who are trying to disrupt peace , official media reported on Tuesday . 
than Shwe , chairman of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , made the comments to leaders of the Union Solidarity and Develoment Association ( USDA ) . 
&quot; It is the duty of the entire people including USDA members to resolutely crush destructive elements inside and outside the country as the common enemy who are disrupting all the development endeavours with the sole aim of gaining power , &quot; the papers quoted Than Shwe saying in a speech to USDA leaders . 
than Shwe &apos;s comments appeared aimed at opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy . 
it is unclear what the main function of the government-run USDA is , although it is one of the largest organisations in the country . 
than Shwe said it now had about five million members . 
diplomats and opposition leaders believe the USDA was behind weekend attacks on Suu Kyi &apos;s motorcade , when cars in the convoy were attacked by a group of stick-wielding , stone-throwing young men . 
Suu Kyi , who was not injured in the incident , has blamed the government for orchestrating the attacks . 
diplomats said about 2,000 young men were milling about near Suu Kyi &apos;s house in well-organised groups on Saturday , and some of them participated in two attacks on the cars in Suu Kyi &apos;s motorcade . 
one diplomat said he was told by some of the young men they came from neighbouring townships and had been paid and trucked in by the government to cause unrest . 
a government official told Reuters on Monday the attacks were acts of sabotage from which the government had nothing to gain . 
USDA members have also been used to attend mass public rallies against Suu Kyi and the democracy movement over the past year , diplomats say .
