Bundesliga pace-setters Cologne on Sunday suffered their second major shock in two days when Zwickau of the second division dumped them out of the German Cup 3-1 after extra time . 
only a day earlier , Cologne learned out of the blue that their former international goalkeeper Bodo Illgner had signed for Real Madrid in the middle of the night , minutes before the expiry of the Spanish transfer deadline . 
Cologne , who led the league until last week after three straight wins , appeared to have put the shock behind them on Sunday when Holger Gaissmayer gave them the lead in the 17th minute . 
but Zwickau gained the upper hand in the second half , equalising in the 70th minute and clinching a deserved win with two goals in extra time .
