led by corn , U.S. feed ( coarse ) grain output will rise modestly this year , weather a price dip in 1998 / 99 and then enjoy rapid growth and strong prices through 2006 , the U.S. Feed Grains Council said Tuesday . 
it forecast a corn crop of 9.490 billion bushels this year . 
soybeans were pegged at 2.382 billion bushels , wheat at 2.449 billion bushels , sorghum at 610 million bushels , barley at 377 million bushels and oats at 168 million . 
the cotton harvest would be 17.36 million bales . 
the upbeat forecast was prepared by the council &apos;s staff , sparks Companies Inc and the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University . 
&quot; Overall , the U.S. economic outlook continues to be clearly positive for agriculture and agribusiness over the decade , &quot; the forecast said . 
&quot; continued worldwide economic growth will stimulate commodity and food demand . 
&quot; At the same time , there are no appreciable factors placing upward pressure on U.S. production costs , implying an increasingly competitive sector facing very strong overseas markets with less and less disruption from governments . 
according to the forecast , U.S. corn acreage will rise 1.1 percent , to 80.7 million acres ( 30 million hectares ) this year and output by 2.4 percent . 
exports would leap seven percent to 2.092 billion bushels or 52.88 million tonnes . 
&quot; This implies a modest 8.3 million tonne , or 32.8-percent , increase in stocks and a season average price of about $ 2.45 per bushel , a level exceeded only twice since 1984 , &quot; it said . 
the average corn price for 1996 / 97 would be $ 2.74 . 
like other analysts , the writers of the report said corn and feed grain area would expand at the expense of soybeans , wheat , cotton and rice in the long term . 
the outlook through 2005 / 06 &quot; is for a rapidly growing subsector that adjusts quickly to the severe price shocks of 1995 / 96 , &quot; the forecast said , crediting strong markets for grains and for high-value meats , milk and egg products . 
U.S. feed ( coarse ) grain area would grow to 43.3 million hectares or 107.8 million acres by decade &apos;s end . 
wheat , soybeans , cotton and rice would fall by the same amount . 
feed grain output was estimated to rise by 1.5 percent annually . 
corn area and output would benefit the most , up nearly 1.7 million hectares or 4.3 million acres and production by 42.8 million tonnes or 1.69 billion bushels . 
for 1997 / 98 , corn would be spurred by rapid growth in domestic and export demand . 
the climb in meat exports can be viewed as disguised grain exports , the forecast said . 
if meat exports continue their rapid climb , by 2005 they would be equivalent of exporting an additional 18.2 million tonnes of feed grains . 
some key uncertainties could change the outcome , the forecast said . 
international tensions could derail grain and meat exports or economic woes could hobble them . 
the biggest threat to strong growth was the question of access to China &apos;s market . 
U.S. officials want China to expand market openings . 
the forecast projected that Conservation Reserve acreage would drop to 28.7 million acres in 1998 / 99 from its current 36.4 million acres . 
it would rebound to nearly 32 million by 2005 . 
its feed grain area , now 10.4 million acres , would fall to 9.3 million during the decade . 
the world market for feed grains was projected to increase by 124.2 million tonnes , or 1.5 percent , each year through 2005 . 
stocks would climb slightly and exports strongly . 
Mexico , South Korea and Taiwan , the second- , third- , and fourth-biggest grain importers , would greatly increase imports . 
Japan , the number one market , would plateau at current levels and buy finished foods , it said .
