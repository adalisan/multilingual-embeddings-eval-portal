the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office told economic advisers at a private meeting Monday that preliminary estimates show the budget deficit about a third lower by 2002 than the office previously thought . 
according to sources familiar with the discussions , the CBO believes the deficit will be about one-third lower than earlier estimates , even without new budget cutting efforts . 
but they cautioned that their early estimates could change significantly . 
CBO makes independent , non-partisan assessments of the economy and budget for use by Congress . 
similar assessments are made at the White House by the Office of Management and Budget . 
CBO is still in the middle of developing its estimates for release next year . 
it gave an early look at its preliminary estimates to a team of outside economic advisers at a closed meeting . 
the source expects a $ 210 billion budget deficit in 2002 with no further deficit cutting efforts instead of an earlier estimate of $ 300 billion . 
these numbers are so-called baseline numbers , and assume no major budget changes . 
both President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress have pledged to develop a budget plan that would wipe out the budget deficit by 2002 . 
these new estimates , if they hold , should make it easier to get to balance . 
but the new estimates could spawn arguments over whether to cut spending less or use the estimates to give greater tax relief . 
the CBO said , according to the sources , that the better news was due to higher tax receipts and because the expensive Medicare health program for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor grew more slowly than expected last year . 
CBO economists told their outside advisers they know that the unusually low growth of health costs last year will not continue . 
but they are wrestling with the question of whether or not Medicare and Medicaid growth will return to its peak growth of years past . 
but the same early indications show that the growth in doctors fees and other services , known as Part B Medicare , is beginning to stabilize .
