U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices were called steady to $ 1.00 per cwt higher Friday , but some dealers expressed doubt that meat packers will be as aggressive as they were Thursday . 
meat packers may have covered much of their immediate slaughter needs by late Thursday , when they were aggressively paying $ 1.00 to $ 1.50 per cwt higher prices for hogs , sources said . 
if that is the case , they said hogs may trade steady Friday . 
however , others believe snow and frigid weather now in the Midwest could slow hog marketings and keep prices firm Friday . 
&quot; We will have a top of at least $ 54.00 tomorrow , &quot; said an Illinois hog dealer . 
Illinois hogs traded up to $ 53.00 per cwt Thursday . 
Iowa sources said prices may be steady , which would result in a top price Friday of $ 54.00 . 
they said steady cash pork prices at midday Thursday could discourage higher bids , because meat packers should want to protect their steady to slightly negative operating margins .
