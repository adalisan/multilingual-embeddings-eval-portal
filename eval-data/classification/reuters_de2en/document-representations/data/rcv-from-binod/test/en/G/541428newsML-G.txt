Marseille stalled Monaco &apos;s march towards the French first division title by holding them 1-1 at the Louis II stadium on Saturday . 
midfielder Sylvain Legwinski saved Monaco from defeat when he headed a 62nd minute equaliser after Xavier Gravelaine had put the former European champions ahead in the 35th minute with a fine cross shot for his 14th in the league . 
Monaco extended their lead to 12 points with four games to go but second-placed Paris St Germain will reduce it to 10 points if they beat bottom club Nice at home on Sunday . 
Strasbourg &apos;s former PSG striker Pascal Nouma hit all four of his side &apos;s goals as they won 4-1 at Montpellier , ending the home team &apos;s 12-game unbeaten run in the league . 
Nantes , who needed a late penalty by Jocelyn Gourvennec to extend their unbeaten run to 27 games with a 1-1 draw against Caen at home , pulled level with PSG on points and climbed into second place on goal difference .
