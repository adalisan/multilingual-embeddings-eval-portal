Hong Kong &apos;s domestic money markets were trading very quietly on Monday but leaning towards weakness on lingering U.S. rate uncertainty , dealers said . 
&quot; We do not see much demand for the U.S. dollar at these levels given the uncertainty about whether the U.S. will raise rates at this FOMC ( Federal Open Market Committee ) meeting in early May , &quot; one analyst said . 
three-month Hong Kong dollar forwards , or swaps , were at 17 basis points and 45 basis points in the six-month . 
liquidity in the interbank money market was tight , with the overnight rate bid at 5.37 percent . 
the three-month Hong Kong deposit was at 5.50 percent against the U.S. three-month treasury yield at 5.24 percent for a spread of 26 basis points . 
Goverment paper was generally weaker . 
the two-year Hong Kong Exchange Fund Note ( EFN ) was yielding 5.90 percent against the U.S. two-year treasury at 6.09 percent for a spread of 19 basis points . 
the 10-year EFN yield was at 7.13 percent against the U.S. 10-year at 6.57 percent for a spread of 16 basis points . 
among other yields , the three-year EFN was at 6.22 percent , the five-year was at 6.66 percent and the seven-year was at 6.91 percent .
