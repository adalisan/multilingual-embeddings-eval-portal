Burma &apos;s military government added seven extra years to double the jail term for Win Htein , the personal assistant for democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi , a dissident source said on Wednesday . 
&quot; They added seven years , so he now must serve altogether 14 years , &quot; an official from Suu Kyi &apos;s National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party told Reuters . 
he said the additional term was given on August 30 , but he did not know the reason . 
&quot; We don &apos;t know why they added to his term , &quot; he said . 
last month the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) sentenced Win Htein to seven years at Insein Prison under section five of the Emergency Provisions Act . 
the government announced the sentence last week and said Win Htein was being held for &quot; malicious acts aimed at destruction of the peace and stability of the state . 
it said he took part in a &quot; conspiracy &quot; to make a video fabricating the poor situation of Burmese farmers . 
Suu Kyi said in a news conference on Saturday that Win Htein had not taken part in making the video but had only set up a time for her to meet the party members who had made the video . 
government officials were not immediately available for comment . 
win Htein was one of the 262 NLD members detained in May in a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement ahead of a controversial party meeting . 
the SLORC , which said it had made the detentions in an effort to avoid anarchy from the meeting , released most of the activists but kept several dozen in detention . 
most of those still detained were key members of Suu Kyi &apos;s party , diplomats said . 
many have been given long jail sentences .
