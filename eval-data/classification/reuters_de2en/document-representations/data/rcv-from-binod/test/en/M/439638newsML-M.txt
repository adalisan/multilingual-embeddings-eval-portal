soybean prices closed lower on Thursday as rumors swirled about imports of Brazilian soybeans into the United States , the world &apos;s largest soybean producer . 
soybeans , which hit an 8-1 / 2 year high earlier this week at the Chicago Board of Trade amid booming demand from domestic processors , on Wednesday had fallen nearly the 30 cent per bushel limit when a trading house , Glencore , said it had sold 45,000 metric tons of soybeans to a U.S. buyer . 
on Thursday March soybeans closed another 1-1 / 2 cents a bushel lower at $ 8.21 , after trading as low as $ 8.12 . 
after the close of trading Thursday , a small Kentucky processor , Owensboro grain Co , confirmed that it had bought 150,000 tons of &quot; optional origin &quot; soybeans this week -- meaning the beans could come from the United States or from other producers including Brazil , Argentina or Paraguay . 
&quot; This market is still showing a negative tone left from yesterday &apos;s heavy break , &quot; said Jason Roose , analyst with U.S. commodities . 
&quot; South American prices are a lot cheaper and we &apos;re coming into harvest . 
at these high levels , are we going to be competitive ? 
soybeans are processed or &quot; crushed &quot; to produce soymeal , a high-protein livestock feed , and soyoil , widely used in food and industrial products . 
the U.S. Agriculture Department on March 11 estimated that U.S. processors would crush a record 1.42 billion bushels in the year to September 1 on booming demand . 
March corn futures closed up 3 cents a bushel at $ 3.00-3 / 4 after the Agriculture Department reported higher than expected export sales of 1.009 million tons in the week to March 6 . 
traders had expected sales of 700,000 to 800,000 tons and the news calmed some fears that China , which has registered large recent sales to South Korea , may hurt U.S. exports . 
&quot; It &apos;s coming back and the export sales were good , &quot; said analyst Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter . 
at the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York , coffee prices fell sharply on an easing in supply concerns . 
may coffee closed down 13.85 cents per pound at 182.25 cents , a drop of seven percent on the day . 
&quot; The fundamentals are slowly changing , &quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka . 
&quot; Higher prices for coffee will bring more coffee into the market . 
Colombia is selling old-crop coffee to make money . 
Brazil is selling old-crop coffee to make money . 
he pointed to a report from the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters saying Brazilian coffee exports so far this year have reached 2.33 million 132-pound bags , nearly twice the 1.18 million bags shipped in the first two months of 1996 . 
since early December , coffee futures prices have nearly doubled as worries about low stock levels in both consuming and producing nations , coupled with projections for smaller crops in many Latin American countries , fueled supply woes . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange , crude oil prices rose on indications that imports from Europe would slow . 
April crude oil ended at $ 20.70 a barrel , up 8 cents . 
North Sea loadings of Britain &apos;s benchmark Brent crude oil were scheduled to slow down in April , traders said . 
&quot; The Brent loading program assisted us here as the strength in London was carried over to the NYMEX , &quot; said prudential Securities oil market analyst Richard Redash . 
in refined products , a cold snap expected to hit the northeastern United States early next week boosted heating oil prices . 
April heating oil ended 0.14 cent per gallon higher at 54.22 cents , while April gasoline closed 0.40 cent per gallon lower at 64.23 cents .
