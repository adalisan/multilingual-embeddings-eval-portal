the Brazilian government may prompt a further reduction in interest rates if monthly inflation stays at about 0.5 percent , Folha de S. Paulo newspaper said . 
the government now pays an annual interest rate of about 25 percent on its public debt , which serves as a referential rate for the rest of the economy , the paper said . 
high interest rates are a source of complaints against President Fernando Henrique Cardoso &apos;s government from Brazil &apos;s private sector , which claims lower rates would spur economic growth , it said . 
rates , which reached 4.04 percent a month in 1995 , have come down this year . 
the Central Bank &apos;s new TBC basic monthly interest rate has dropped from 2.0 percent when it was created in June to 1.88 percent today . 
Folha said the Finance Ministry and Central Bank are studying if rates can be further reduced . 
but some economic team members worry Brazil &apos;s international reserves will drain if interest rates cease to be attractive to foreign investors . 
reserves stood at $ 58.287 billion in August and ministry officials do not feel a drop would be a major problem , it said .
