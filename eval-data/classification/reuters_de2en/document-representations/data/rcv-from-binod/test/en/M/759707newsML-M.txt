Brazil stocks are expected to remain steady Monday , treading water amid little fresh market-moving news , with Bolsa turnover slightly higher than Friday &apos;s weak volume , analysts said . 
&quot; Unfortunately it will maintain Friday &apos;s trend , with a volume a little bit higher , &quot; a local trader said . 
share prices ended virtually unchanged Friday on very thin volume , closing at 12,523 points . 
traders said a lack of congressional activity this week may contribute to the Bolsa &apos;s steady mood . 
newspapers said lawmakers are taking the last week of July off after Congress on Friday ended its extraordinary sessions . 
analysts also said they were unsure how a decision by federally-owned firm Telebras to grant shares to telephone subscribers who acquired phone lines in 1996 would affect the company &apos;s stock . 
the measure , which reverses an earlier decision to pay off the subscribers in cash , was announced by the company over the weekend . 
Telebras stock is the most active on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange ( Bovespa ) , accounting for an average 60 percent of total trade .
