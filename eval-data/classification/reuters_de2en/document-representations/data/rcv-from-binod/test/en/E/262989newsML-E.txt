analysts reaction to an optimistic inflation report from Sweden &apos;s central bank , the Riksbank , that said the outlook for inflation over the coming two years was good which coincided with a 25 basis point cut in the repo rate to 4.10 percent . 
the Riksbank said that there is some limited room for further rate cuts and it seems as if it will slow down ( its rate cutting pace ) somewhat . 
the rate cut was expected and market reaction was calm . 
the market shows its strength as bond yields are falling while German bunds are edging higher , so the spread ( to Germany ) is narrowing . 
the Riksbank suggests that as conditions have improved somewhat , there remains some scope to reduce the repo rate . 
we would tend to agree with this thinking , as much of the interest rate easing that has been initiated since the turn of the year , nearly five percent , has been offset by falling inflation and a strengthening currency , leaving monetary conditions similar to those seen in January . 
the Riksbank painted a more optimistic view of inflation in its latest report , saying conditions have improved yet further although one area of future risk could be wage growth if it is sustained a current levels .
