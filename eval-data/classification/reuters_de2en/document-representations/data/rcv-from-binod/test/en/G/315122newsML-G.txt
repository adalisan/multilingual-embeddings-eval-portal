a Paris court refused on Friday to hand a Murillo painting , bought in murky circumstances by the Louvre Museum in 1985 , to the heir of its former owner , justice sources said . 
the Louvre bought the 17th century Spanish master &apos;s &quot; Sevillan Gentleman &quot; for five million francs ( a million dollars ) from Joelle Pesnel , a woman who pretended to be the heir of its owner , Suzanne de Canson . 
investigators later discovered that Pesnel had abducted the elderly Canson and had let her die of lack of care and food in September 1986 . 
Pesnel was sentenced in 1991 to 13 years in jail together with an accomplice , lawyer Robert Boissonnet . 
the initial owner &apos;s sister , Jeanne de Canson , recognised in 1994 as her sole heir , believes the French state and the Louvre showed scant concern for the painting &apos;s origin and sued for its return plus 15 million francs ( three million dollars ) in damages . 
the Paris court ruled that the state &apos;s bad faith was &quot; not sufficiently proven &quot; and the Louvre museum was not to blame . 
the painting , a portrait of Sevillan noble Inigo Melchior Fernandez Velasco , still hangs in the Louvre and is worth an estimated 15 million francs .
