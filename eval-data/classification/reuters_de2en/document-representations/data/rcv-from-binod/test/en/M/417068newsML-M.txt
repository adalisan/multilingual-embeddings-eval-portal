cocoa futures seemed to have emerged from the gloom and doom of a long-term downtrend after a surge of nearly three percent in prices on Tuesday . 
as short funds scrambled for cover , traders turned increasingly confident that the market would keep its foothold above the nine-month downtrend line . 
&quot; non-stop spec buying , that &apos;s what we saw . 
it &apos;s been relentless , &quot; said one trader . 
the rally had run into substantial origin and left-over hedge selling , but the close on May near the peak of 932 stg injected fresh optimism and paved the way for a rise to the January high of 938 , traders said . 
benchmark May , which absorbed most of 12,109 lots turnover with a volume of 7,569 , was the day &apos;s biggest winner , closing 26 stg higher at 930 stg a tonne . 
other contracts made gains of between 10 and 18 stg . 
Fund buying was technically inspired following a chart reversal on Friday and a rebound in moving averages . 
but without any fundamental justification the market could also run out of steam , some traders said . 
&quot; It looks like a very strong close but there was a lot of selling around on the closer , &quot; said one . 
&quot; Until we get a bit more fundamental news of some sort , this could be regarded as a correction rather than a short-covering rally , &quot; he added . 
may spreads tightened dramatically with May / July coming in to 12 , Sept / Dec to five and May / Dec to 33 as a result of the speculative covering . 
elsewhere , light showers forecast in Ivory Coast cocoa areas later this week suggested a more optimistic outlook for the midcrop , according to Joel Burgio , senior agricultural meteorologist at weather Services Corp. 
&quot; There is some risk of a few afternoon showers , especially towards the end of this week . 
so that &apos;s a little bit optimistic , &quot; he told Reuters by telephone . 
&quot; Maybe we will move to spring and pick up some better ( rain ) activity . 
it appeared to him that February &apos;s unusually dry conditions , which put stress on cocoa trees , were unlikely to continue in March after an increase in moisture levels recently . 
but an interruption in the rainfall pattern in March and April could be more damaging for the crop , he added .
