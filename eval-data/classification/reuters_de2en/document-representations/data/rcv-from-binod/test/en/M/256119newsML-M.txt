German shares took a slide in Friday &apos;s bourse trade , spooked by a nosedive on Wall Street and a technical collapse on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange which had blocked prices for over an hour in pre-bourse dealings . 
the DAX index slid 47.37 points , or 1.7 percent , to end the session at 2,799.71 points , after a 100-point tumble on the Dow Jones index -- the biggest since July -- triggered memories of last Friday &apos;s markets rout . 
&quot; We had Wall Street , we had this technical problem and it &apos;s Friday the 13th as well , &quot; said a Duesseldorf dealer . 
&quot; We all got a wee bit nervous . 
people aren &apos;t sure if we are going into a weak phase for stocks or not , &quot; he added . 
the futures market was an early cause for concern as the December DAX futures contract tumbled below the crucial 2,800-point level . 
as the close of bourse trade , futures were down 54 points at 2,796 , just off their intraday low . 
&quot; fundamentally , there is no real justification for the German market to be under this kind of pressure , &quot; another dealer said . 
&quot; But we just can &apos;t get away from Wall Street . 
there was minimal focus on corporate news . 
the only blue chip stock to buck the downward trend was carmaker Volkswagen , which was upgraded to &quot; outperform &quot; from &quot; neutral &quot; by Lehman Brothers despite the damaging publicity it is facing over criminal charges against its former management board member , Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua . 
Volkswagen ended the session up 3.75 marks at 603.75 . 
the biggest decliners were chemical stocks , which had been pushed up in recent days . 
there was no immediate explanation for the technical problems at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange .
