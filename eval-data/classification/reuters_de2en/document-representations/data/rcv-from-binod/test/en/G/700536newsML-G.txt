China marked its first day of Hong Kong rule on Tuesday by sending in thousands of troops and promising citizens their rich , free lifestyle will be unchanged . 
elite units of the People &apos;s Liberation Army swarmed into the territory through drenching rain at dawn , emphatically stamping Beijing &apos;s authority on this capitalist enclave . 
the iron fist was later wrapped in a velvet glove when China &apos;s President Jiang Zemin pledged that this East Asian economic hub would remain economically powerful with autonomy and existing freedoms . 
his wide-ranging speech , upholding the private enterprise and investment which underpins Hong Kong &apos;s success , was clearly aimed at easing anxiety here and abroad about the territory &apos;s freedom and prosperity . 
the message was : under Beijing it will be mostly business as usual for Hong Kong . 
China wants to see it &quot; forever vigorous and dynamic &quot; , he said . 
his reassurance on the future of democracy here , backed by China &apos;s anointed leader Tung Chee-hwa , came hours after a midnight handover ceremony when Hong Kong returned to China ending 156 years of British rule . 
most residents started their first day under Beijing confined to their homes by some of the year &apos;s worst storms . 
but the lashing rain and official weather bureau warnings to stay home did not keep thousands of people from welcoming troops who arrived just six hours after Britain handed back the colony . 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright promised that Washington would continue to speak out about Hong Kong . 
but U.S. officials privately expressed satisfaction that Jiang &quot; said the right things &quot; and set the right tone during his handover speech . 
the PLA garrison , 4,000-strong with elements from the ground , navy and air forces , crossed into Hong Kong , now known as a Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) , at three main land points and on ships . 
the troops and sailors stood erect and impassive in the rain as they were welcomed with garlands , flowers and banners . 
dragon dancers pranced along routes as lines of vehicles trundled by . 
a flotilla of 10 warships steamed down the coastline to dock at Stonecutters Island on the northwestern edge of Hong Kong harbour . 
helicopters also carried in troops . 
although the blunt display of military force has drawn condemnation from Britain and milder rebuke from the United States , Beijing views it as a joyous affirmation of sovereignty after a century and a half of colonial shame . 
pro-democracy activists regard the arrival of PLA forces , and particularly armoured cars , as a provocative reminder of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing . 
lined up neatly on the back of trucks , and clapping in unison , troops were sent off by banners and balloons on the mainland side of the border . 
crowds stood 20-deep under umbrellas to watch the cavalcade . 
in a midnight ceremony , heir to the British throne Prince Charles handed Hong Kong , its 6.4 million people and its trading bounty to Jiang , leaving the Pearl of the Orient to a communist giant . 
Charles and departing Governor Chris Patten , with his wife and their three daughters , left aboard the royal yacht Britannia . 
Party-goers cruised nightclubs , business executives and thousands of protesters took to the streets . 
&quot; In the eyes of the world , we call on the Chinese government to allow free , fair and democratic elections immediately , &quot; said leading democracy campaigner Martin Lee . 
he was speaking to thousands of supporters at the building of the old elected legislature , dissolved by Beijing when Hong Kong was handed over and replaced by a China-picked assembly . 
Jiang later told Hong Kong residents that a promised high degree of self-rule would be honoured for Hong Kong , now the richest city in China . 
&quot; There is no reason to change ( autonomy promises ) .. all these will be long-term directions ( governing Hong Kong ) , &quot; Jiang said in a speech during an inauguration ceremony of the new Hong Kong government as part of China . 
&quot; The overwhelming majority of the laws previously in force will be maintained , &quot; Jiang said . 
&quot; Hong Kong residents will enjoy their rights and freedoms in accordance with law and all will be equal before the law . 
Jiang said Hong Kong would retain the status of a free port and an international financial , trade and shipping centre , while keeping ties with other countries and organisations , &quot; so that this international economic metropolis will forever be vigorous and dynamic .
