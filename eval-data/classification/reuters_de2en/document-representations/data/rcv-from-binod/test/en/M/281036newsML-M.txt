Swedish shares closed 1996 at a record high on Monday , supported by favourable international trends and a surge in pharmaceutical giant Astra . 
the general index rose 1.14 percent to a closing all-time high of 2371.12 , ending the record year 1996 , during which the index surged 38 percent , on an upbeat note . 
turnover was , however , a bit below average at 2.81 billion crowns as many market players were away ahead of the two-day New Year holiday . 
the market will open again on Thursday . 
Astra rose on getting marketing clearance from the U.S. FDA for Lexxel , an agent for the treatment of hypertension . 
Astra leapt nine crowns to 337 crowns on the news , in turn helping to lift the general index further . 
after the record year 1996 , in which turnover surged to 915 billion crowns from 665 billion crowns in 1995 , five analysts polled by Reuters forecast a slower development in 1996 , targeting , on average , a 13 percent general index increase . 
dealers saw , however , continued positive trends in January , but a downturn early in the month . 
&quot; People might want to take profits after the year-end , &quot; a dealer said , referring to investors &apos; reluctance to sell shares late 1996 and be taxed for the profit on huge gains . 
along with Astra , rival Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn helped make the chemicals and pharmaceutical sector the clear winner , up 2.35 percent . 
Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn rose 4.5 crowns to 279.5 crowns . 
telecommunications group Ericsson also supported indices the last day of trading 1996 and rose by 2.5 crowns to 211 crowns . 
computer company Enator was also going strong , lifted by a newspaper article saying that there were seven serious would-be buyers of the state &apos;s 25 percent stake , which will be sold shortly . 
the share rose seven crowns to 174.5 crowns .
