there is little to fear and little to cheer in the Bund market , leaving Bund option volatility levels on hold , dealers said on Friday . 
the absence of major U.S. data stifled options activity over the session . 
Bund volatility will remain stable early next week , ahead of a stream of German economic releases , dealers said . 
&quot; People are not expecting any big market moves , &quot; said Antoin Rolland at Transoptions Finance in London . 
&quot; The Bund future is staying between 103.00 and 103.50 . 
the June Bund future was trading at 103.41 at 1450 GMT , nine basis points below Thursday &apos;s close . 
volatility on the April Bund option exercisable into the June contract was at 5.60 percent , according to Transoptions Finance , compared with a LIFFE close of 5.18 percent . 
may volatility was quoted at 5.50 percent , against a close of 5.40 percent , and June was also at 5.50 percent , compared with 5.29 percent on Thursday . 
March Bund options expired on Friday . 
most Bund options volume was in the June 101.00 puts and 104.00 calls . 
dealers said a couple of firms were continuing a volatility play of the past two days , which involved buying the puts and selling the calls . 
over 8,000 contracts changed hands in the trade on Friday . 
the options market brushed off Eurostat &apos;s decision to give Italy the go-ahead for its &quot; Euro tax &quot; designed to cut Italy &apos;s budget deficit . 
&quot; BTPs were not affected , &quot; said John Holmes at Nationsbank in London . 
&quot; There is very little interest in all the markets .
