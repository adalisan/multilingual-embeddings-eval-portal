Britain &apos;s sickly manufacturing sector showed a slight sign of recovery in August with firms reporting a modest rise in overall demand , the Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) said on Friday . 
but its August industrial trends survey found orders were still well below normal levels for the time of year , hit in particular by sluggish demand for British goods abroad . 
only 19 percent of firms saw orders rise , compared with 29 percent who saw them fall . 
firms have regarded orders as below normal for the time of year for 12 months in a row . 
&quot; Although manufacturing demand has improved to its best level so far this year , companies will find it difficult to raise more than one cheer , &quot; said Sudhir Junankar , associate director of economic analysis at the CBI . 
he said total order books remained significantly below normal despite some improvement in home demand . 
the survey showed demand from overseas had weakened further , leaving export order books in their worst state since February 1994 . 
Junankar said the European market in particular showed little sign of improvement with France and Germany very weak . 
excessive stock levels continued to dog the industry but fewer firms than last month reported stocks of finished goods were more than adequate to meet expected demand . 
given the persistently low level of demand , firms said they did not expect to raise their prices over the next four months . 
but the beleaguered manufacturing sector will contribute significantly to output growth next year , the CBI said in its latest quarterly economic forecast , also released on Friday . 
the CBI forecasts manufacturing output will grow by 3.9 percent next year , a marginal downward revision from its previous forecast made in May , while its 1996 forecast has been revised down to 0.6 percent from 1.0 percent at the last round . 
output grew by 2.2 percent in 1995 . 
the CBI also forecast steady , unspectacular growth in gross domestic product ( GDP ) to continue in 1996 but said there was no need for another interest rate cut . 
&quot; Our stance is that interest rates should be left on hold , &quot; said Kate Barker , the CBI &apos;s chief economic adviser . 
&quot; The risk of a new recession is only slight 
it forecast that GDP would grow 2.0 percent in 1996 with activity picking up to 3.1 percent in 1997 .
