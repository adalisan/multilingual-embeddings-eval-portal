spot differentials -- except Colombians -- slid on the New York physical coffee market this week , as nearby futures surged to 20-year highs , traders said . 
lower differentials , however , did little to entice roasters , who balked at pricing against the sky-high CSCE July contract . 
July &apos;s premium to second-month September bulged to over 40 cents this week . 
&quot; differentials have collapsed on nearby coffees , but business is dead , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; Roasters don &apos;t want to buy coffee against July , they want to wait to price against September and they have enough coffee to slip by . 
spot Brazilian Santos 4s were heard at 65 cents under CSCE July this week , some 10 cents below week ago levels . 
spot Santos 2 / 3s fetched up to 60 cents under &quot; C &quot; , while August delivery Santos 2 / 3s garnered 30 cents under September . 
spot mild coffee from Central American origins , such as Guatemala and El Salvador , were offered at three cents over &quot; C &quot; , down sharply from some 20 cents over heard in recently . 
although Colombian MAMs for spot delivery held steady at 40 cents over the board , traders said they expect those premiums to start coming down too . 
private exporters in Colombia reported this week they were having a hard time finding buyers for about 300,000 60-kg bags of green coffee for shipment in June . 
exporters , who originally offered the coffee to European and Japanese roasters , said there have been little interest in the coffee in North America because it is priced against July . 
surging futures prices have forced roasters to pass along higher costs to consumers . 
this week , Starbucks Corp. said it planned to raise prices for the second time this year to reflect the higher cost of coffee beans worldwide . 
traders feared higher retail prices going into the low consumption season would prompt coffee drinkers to opt for other beverages . 
one trader said a major U.S. roaster said if futures prices remained near $ 3 , consumption could fall by 10 to 15 percent . 
CSCE July coffee fell 38.40 cents a lb Friday to settle at 276.40 . 
September ended 35.50 cents lower at 238.30 . 
differentials for spot coffee in New York , ex-warehouse , were quoted as follows , all against the CSCE May contract :
