a senior U.S. official departed on Wednesday for talks in Beijing on China &apos;s arms sales to Iran and Pakistan , paving the way for Secretary of State Warren Christopher &apos;s first visit there in two years . 
the trip by Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis , to be followed by Christopher on November 18-20 , is part of a U.S. effort to build a less contentious relationship with China . 
even as the United States was pursuing more constructive ties with Beijing , however , China sentenced prominent human rights activist Wang Dan to 11 years in prison . 
the sentence meted out Wednesday seemed a glum portent for Christopher &apos;s visit to Beijing , since frictions over human rights have been a main irritant in U.S.-Chinese relations . 
Christopher &apos;s 1994 trip to Beijing was a disaster because of disputes with Beijing , especially over the rights issue . 
the White House expressed deep concern over the prison sentence and said it was &quot; inconceivable &quot; that a government should restrict Wang &apos;s speaking out on human rights . 
in another sensitive development , the New York Times reported on Wednesday that a federal grand jury is investigating whether U.S. aircraft giant McDonnell Douglas or its Chinese partner , the Chinese Aviation Ministry , knowingly violated American export control laws . 
China has become increasingly loud in its demands for technology , some of it of potential military value , in return for billions of dollars in contracts . 
officials said Davis planned to discuss in Beijing how the two countries might implement a peaceful nuclear cooperation pact that could provide Beijing U.S. nuclear power reactors . 
although signed in 1985 , the accord has not been put into effect because the U.S. president must first certify China is not assisting unsafeguarded nuclear facilities . 
in the late 1980 &apos;s when certification was underway , U.S. officials received evidence of China &apos;s sales and other aid to Pakistan . 
then in 1989 , Chinese leaders forcibly ended a pro-democracy protest in Tiananmen Square , sending Sino-American ties into a downward spiral . 
but last May 11 , China agreed not to provide aid such as ring magnets and other devices used in nuclear arms production to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities . 
that set the stage for new talks with Washington on non-proliferation issues . 
Director John Holum of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency , recently visited Beijing , while Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Einhorn hosted talks here on peaceful nuclear cooperation and proliferation concerns . 
Einhorn and other U.S. officials are in Beijing now for expert talks ahead of Davis &apos; meetings on Monday and Tuesday . 
U.S. officials hope to build on the May 11 accord so China can qualify for U.S. lightwater nuclear power reactors . 
but they say it will take &quot; many months &quot; for Beijing to put in place the kind of export control system that will give Washington confidence China is adhering to its commitments . 
so far , senior U.S. officials insist they have no evidence China has violated the May 11 agreement not to provide more nuclear related assistance to states like Pakistan . 
recently , there were news reports that Beijing made a new nuclear-related sale to Islamabad but U.S. officials say this deal was struck before May 11 and was covered by that pact . 
Davis will renew concerns over Chinese sales of conventional arms to Iran , branded by Washington a terrorism-sponsoring state . 
transfers of cruise missiles to Iran have been going on for six months or more , officials say . 
U.S. officials are investigating reports Indonesia and China are close to a deal to sell Iran five French helicopters that are believed will be armed with air-launched missiles . 
officials said Davis and Christopher aim to ensure the dialogue on arms sales and related issues becomes a regular feature of the relationship , insulated from other issues .
