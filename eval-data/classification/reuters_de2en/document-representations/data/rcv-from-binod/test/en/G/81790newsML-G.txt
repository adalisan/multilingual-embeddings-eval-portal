the U.N. Security Council began a debate at 11 : 22 a.m. EDT / 1522 GMT on Friday on the bloody crisis between Israel and the Palestinians that threatens the Middle East peace process . 
the violence , which has killed at least 66 people over the past three days , followed Israel &apos;s opening of a second entrance to an archaeological tunnel for tourists in Jerusalem &apos;s Old City which runs close to the al-Aqsa mosque , Islam &apos;s third holiest shrine , and Judaism &apos;s Western or Wailing Wall . 
but the bloodshed was also fuelled by Palestinian frustration at lack of progress in the peace process since the election in May of Israel &apos;s right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . 
the debate was requested by the Arab group of states and by Egypt , the only Arab member of the 15-nation council . 
representatives of more than 30 countries were expected to take part , including a number of foreign ministers now in New York for the General Assembly session . 
Arab sources said they were discussing a possible resolution that would condemn Israel &apos;s actions resulting in loss of life and injury to Palestinians ; demanding the closing of the controversial tunnel ; and call for the immediate resumption of the Middle East peace process and the timely implementation of accords already reached .
