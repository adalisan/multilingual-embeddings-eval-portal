President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole on Sunday mounted a frenetic final push for votes as polls showed the race tighter but still forecast a victory for Clinton in Tuesday &apos;s election . 
Republicans , however , seemed in an increasingly strong position to maintain control of both houses of Congress , leaving Clinton with a clouded mandate for his second term . 
dole , halfway through an unprecedented 96-hour around-the-clock campaign blitz , arrived in California after a long night , during which he flew halfway across the country holding rallies along the way . 
the 73-year-old veteran , defying his years and ignoring the need to sleep , addressed supporters in Omaha , Nebraska ; Sioux Falls , South Dakota ; Grand junction , Colorado , and Las Vegas before making a pre-dawn landing in San Diego . 
the Dole campaign was energized by poll data showing Clinton &apos;s lead narrowing after weeks during which the president held a double-digit advantage and had seemed headed for a landslide victory . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to go around the clock , &quot; Dole told a cheering crowd in the ballroom of the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas . 
&quot; We can feel the momentum building and it &apos;s building all across America . 
although Dole &apos;s voice at times showed signs of strain , he continued to campaign enthusiastically . 
on Saturday , he added new stops to his itinerary , bringing to 19 the number of states on his route . 
in an interview with ABC &apos;s David Brinkley , Dole said undecided voters were coming to him in the final hours of the marathon campaign . 
&quot; We &apos;re just now been getting an indication that the undecided are breaking in our favor . 
&quot; But the president &apos;s tough , &quot; Dole added . 
&quot; Any incumbent president &apos;s tough . 
this president &apos;s a skilled orator . 
the Reuters daily tracking poll showed Dole within four percentage points of Clinton . 
ABC had the president 10 points ahead and Gallup put the president &apos;s lead at 13 points . 
individual state polls gave Dole some reason for hope . 
he was neck-and-neck with Clinton in Georgia and Tennessee , within five points in Ohio and led Clinton in Nevada -- all states Clinton carried in 1992 . 
equally significantly , Republicans pulled ahead in the Reuters poll in the battle for Congress . 
the Republicans seized control of both houses in 1994 for the first time in 40 years . 
this year , they have been targets of an all-out assault by Democrats and their Labor union allies . 
most analysts now expect the Republicans to hold their own or even increase their majority in the Senate and to hold their losses in the House to a relatively small number . 
Clinton aides said he remained confident of his own victory and struck a high-minded tone in his first event of the day at a black church in Tampa , Florida . 
he later met with the mayor of St. Petersburg , Florida , scene of a riot last month after police shot a black youth . 
Clinton said the choice before the voters on Tuesday was whether to build the nation &apos;s future on the &quot; shifting sands of division or the strong rock of common ground . 
&quot; We know that there are still too many white people who wouldn &apos;t feel as comfortable as I do sitting in this church , &quot; Clinton told the black congregation . 
&quot; They read the same Bible you do . 
they claim the same savior you do . 
they ought to feel at home here . 
in addition to Florida , Clinton &apos;s schedule on Sunday included New Jersey , Massachusetts , Maine and New Hampshire , where many of the stops are more designed to help congressional candidates rather than himself . 
after California , Dole was to head on Monday to Arizona , New Mexico , Texas , Louisiana , Tennessee and Iowa . 
dole said intends to finish his campaign on Tuesday in Independence , Missouri , the hometown of Harry Truman , who came from behind to win the 1948 presidential race .
