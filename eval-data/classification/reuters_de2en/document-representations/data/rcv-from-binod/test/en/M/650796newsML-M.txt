as if European bond investors didn &apos;t have enough to worry about with confusion over European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) , technical analysts said on Tuesday the charts could also send investors scurrying . 
as well as offering a haven from EMU , U.S. treasuries also offer the most positive chart outlook for those investors looking to switch . 
&quot; Europe remains bearish , and recent sharp falls have signalled tests of selling orders , &quot; said Robin Wilkin , senior technical analysis at MCM YieldWatch in London . 
&quot; If you &apos;re looking for a flight to technical quality , then T-bonds offer the best picture . 
analysts said the June 6 price action , when the September T-bond future shot to 111-09 , had completed a base from the end of February by breaking above 110-11 . 
&quot; The break above there ended any chance of a medium-term bear outlook , &quot; said shea Bennett , technical analyst at trend Analysis . 
&quot; It gives a sizeable measurement for the move up , leading to the peak in mid-February . 
on daily continuation charts , the mid-February peak was 114-08 . 
Bennett said the September contract , currently at 110-22 , would &quot; dither &quot; for two to three weeks before heading up . 
he advised buying on dips to 110-00 , adding that only a break down through 109-00 would raise doubts . 
a technical analyst at a major U.S. bank in London said that , while the T-bond chart had bullish potential , he would like to see confirmation of the recent upmove . 
&quot; The problem is , if you take out last Friday , the pattern could be toppish , &quot; he said . 
the 111-20 level was a 50 percent retracement of the move on daily continuation charts from a high of 116-28 at the end of 1996 , down to a low of 106-12 on April . 
a 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the same move using daily charts comes out at 111-22,23 . 
meanwhile , Bennett said the Bund continuation chart was dogged by a potential head-and-shoulders top , with the peak at the 104.04 high in February . 
&quot; Bunds will struggle to make any headway on the upside , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I see it aiming for 101.80 , 102.00 and then falling to take out 99.00 and then to 95.00 . 
by 1220 GMT , the September Bund future was at 100.77 , up 0.07 on the day . 
the U.S. bank analyst noted that Bunds had struggled above the 101.00 level , and would need to take out the recent 101.55 high to improve their outlook . 
but the most bearish chart appeared to be BTPs , according to Wilkin . 
he said the September contract was heading for 128.60 , the May 30 low , and a loss of that figure would lead the contract to 128.32 , a 61.8 percent retracement of the 126.15 to 131.86 April-May rally . 
&quot; Out of all of European ( bonds ) , gilts are a different animal , &quot; said the U.S. bank analyst . 
&quot; It &apos;s supported by strong support around 112-00 , which indicates the market is still healthy . 
recent declines have not negated the picture , he said , despite the dark cloud cover on the candlestick charts . 
he said gilts had potential as far as 114-16 , 115-00 . 
there was also trendline support at 112-26 . 
&quot; As long as that holds , it can head for the 114-31 contract high , &quot; he said . 
September gilt futures were down 8 / 32 at 113-09 .
