Hong Kong shares were mixed in quiet London trading on Tuesday amid a dearth of interest following the recent record-breaking run by shares in the territory , dealers said . 
&quot; The market has been as dead as a dodo , &quot; said a dealer at one major securities house in London . 
&quot; Even the banks have been quiet . 
the Hang Seng London Reference index eased 7.23 points or 0.04 percent to 16,364.29 , after the Hang Seng in Hong Kong closed 111.93 points higher at 16,371.52 . 
the benchmark Hong Kong index earlier set an intraday record of 16,482.74 . 
dealers said there was concern in London that Hong Kong could succumb to a bout of profit-taking though there were few obvious negative influences around . 
&quot; The market could go yet higher , &quot; the dealer said , &quot; there is just no negative news to bring it down .
