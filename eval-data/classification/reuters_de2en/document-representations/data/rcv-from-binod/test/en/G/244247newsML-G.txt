British Conservative &quot; Eurosceptic &quot; Teresa Gorman said on Monday she would introduce a bill in parliament calling for a referendum on Europe next month . 
Gorman said she would press ahead with a bid to give the people of Britain the option of pulling out of the European Union . 
she said she had won a slot on January 21 for introducing the bill . 
&quot; People on both sides of the political fence are frustrated because they are not being asked for their opinion . 
Gorman will introduce the bill under the so-called 10-minute rule which gives members of parliament an opportunity to discuss matters of importance . 
but the bill has almost no chance of becoming law . 
Gorman said she had the support of seven other Eurosceptics who were thrown out of the Conservative parliamentary party in November 1994 for rebelling against government policy on links with the European Union .
