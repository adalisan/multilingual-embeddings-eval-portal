the Thai baht fell to a record low of 31.60 baht per dollar in the domestic market on Wednesday morning on strong commercial demand for dollars , dealers said . 
some dealers believed the baht could slide to 32 against the dollar if the current trend continued . 
however , the baht moved in a 30.00-31.00 per dollar band in the offshore market , they said . 
dealers said most of the buying was from corporates and importers . 
&quot; I suspect corporates bought dollars to repay their foreign debt but I did not notice any panic buying , &quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank . 
&quot; The market was fairly thin actually , and there were virtually no buyers of the baht . 
so , any small dollar buying can exaggerate the market , &quot; he said . 
others said jitters over the soon-to-be-released non-performing loans data of financial institutions to the central bank could also be one of the reasons that sparked dollar buying . 
the figure , to be released , is expected to be discouraging and will put further downward pressure on the baht , they said . 
&quot; There has been this market talk about some foreign financial institutions having stopped rolling over their loans to Thai corporates . 
I don &apos;t know if that is related to the high demand for dollars now , &quot; said another dealer . 
the baht / dollar reference rate was announced by the central bank at 30.842 on Wednesday versus 30.370 a day earlier . 
the overnight interbank rate was steady at 15.00-18.00 percent in a lacklustre market , dealers said . 
although the rate remained high , there was not much activity in the market as major commercial banks preferred to invest in the central bank &apos;s bond repurchase market rather than lend in the overnight market , they said . 
dealers expected the overnight interbank rate to soften slightly as the central bank &apos;s repo rate of the same tenor was lower at around 15.00 percent . 
&quot; This indicated that the Bank of Thailand wanted the interbank rate to ease , &quot; said a dealer with Thai Farmers Bank . 
the one-month baht / dollar swap premium was quoted around 26 / 31 satangs per dollar .
