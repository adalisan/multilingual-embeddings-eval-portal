Henman , leading by two sets to one when bad light halted play on Tuesday evening , refused to permit the Dutchman an escape route to ensure two British players in the last eight for the first time since 1961 . 
the 22-year-old from Oxford , watched by a Centre Court crowd which included former American president George Bush , made the crucial break in the fifth game during a spell in which he won 12 out of 13 points . 
he completed victory in two hours 52 minutes with a love service game and now meets another ex-champion , Germany &apos;s Michael Stich , in the quarter-finals . 
Britain &apos;s other representative in the last eight is Greg Rusedski who meets France &apos;s Cedric Pioline . 
Henman , meanwhile , is the first British man to defeat a defending Wimbledon champion since Roger Taylor beat Rod Laver in 1970 .
