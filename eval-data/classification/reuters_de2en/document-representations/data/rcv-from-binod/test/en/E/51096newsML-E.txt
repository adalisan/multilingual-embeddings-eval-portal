the Shanghai city government has decided to lower income tax for all Shanghai listed firms to 15 percent from 33 percent to help support the stock market , the Shanghai Securities News said on Thursday . 
the policy will benefit about 100 Shanghai listed firms , the newspaper said . 
it gave no details on when the new policy would come into effect . 
in fact the lower tax rate has already been applied to many listed firms , including those with foreign currency B shares on the Shanghai stock exchange and H shares in Hong Kong , which are treated as Sino-foreign joint ventures in China , brokers said . 
&quot; Shanghai will take concrete measures to improve the quality of listed firms with the focus on blue-chip firms , &quot; the paper quoted Huang Qifan , deputy secretary general of the Shanghai municipal government , as telling a seminar on Wednesday . 
with the new measures and the improved national economy , &quot; it is expected that performance of the listed firms will improve around the end of this year or the first half of next year , &quot; Huang was quoted as saying . 
brokers said the measures were announced as part of an effort to boost morale on the Shanghai exchange , which has fallen behind Shenzhen in competition for stock business . 
China &apos;s two bourses have been locked in fierce competition since the establishment of the modern Chinese stock market in late 1990 . 
Shenzhen took the lead in the first two years before being taken over by Shanghai . 
but , since early last year , the underdog has gradually caught up , with its B share market capitalisation and daily turnover of domestic A share trading exceeding Shanghai since the start of this year . 
Huang said the Shanghai city government would cooperate with state-run banks to supply more loans to the listed firms , especially blue-chip companies . 
listed firms will have their laid-off workers transferred to special agencies and will no longer have to bear the financial burden of the medical costs and old-age pensions of these workers , Huang said . 
Huang said the city government was studying how to bring more liquidity to the stock market , including the possibility of setting up more stock investment funds . 
it will encourage firms to use funds raised through the market for mergers and acquisitions . 
it will also help strengthen cooperation between the Shanghai stock exchange and overseas counterparts , Huang said .
