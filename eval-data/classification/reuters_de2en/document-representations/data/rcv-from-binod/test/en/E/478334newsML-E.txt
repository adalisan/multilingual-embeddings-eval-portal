Hungary &apos;s policy will continue to focus on economic growth and stabilisation despite government plans to cut inflation radically next year and the nearness of the 1998 elections , Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy said on Tuesday . 
speaking to stockbrokers and journalists during his visit to the Budapest Stock Exchange , Medgyessy shrugged off concerns often quoted in the press over the country &apos;s economic course . 
&quot; Any softening in economic stabilisation could harm sustainable , long-term economic growth , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There is agreement on economic stabilisation within the government . 
Hungary cut its budget and current account deficits substantially with an economic stabilisation programme launched in March 1995 , while real wages dropped more than 10 percent . 
the government expects living standards to rise slightly this year , while growth of two to three percent in gross economic product ( GDP ) is targeted for this year , compared with stagnation in 1995 . 
Medgyessy added that the anti-inflationary programme , being prepared by the Finance Ministry and the National Bank of Hungary ( NBH ) , would not recreate restraint on the economy . 
&quot; I cannot imagine ( anti-inflationary ) measures drastic enough to harm the beginning of economic growth , &quot; he said . 
urged by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for a radical cut in inflation , the government is preparing an anti-inflationary programme for 1998 , to reduce the pace of nominal wage and price increases . 
this programme , the details of which have not been published yet , would be an alternative of previous plans , which target a cut of five percentage points in inflation in 1998 . 
the government forecasts average CPI of some 17 percent for this year , down from 23.6 percent in 1996 , and said the alternative programme could further reduce inflation to single-digit figures in 1998 . 
however , the more radical anti-inflationary programme can only be carried out if wide-scale price and wage agreement with the employees and the trade unions is reached , Medgyessy said . 
otherwise the government will return to its previous plans of a more moderate reduction in the inflation rate , he added .
