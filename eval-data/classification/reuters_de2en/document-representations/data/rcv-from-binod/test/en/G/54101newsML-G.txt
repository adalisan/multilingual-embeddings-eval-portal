Yemen on Saturday postponed to November the trial of 15 southern separatists who joined a bid to form a breakaway state in the country &apos;s 1994 civil war , a court official said . 
the defendants are being tried in their absence and it was the fifth time their trial was postponed . 
a court in Sanaa set November 17 for the trial after it asked the public prosecutor &apos;s office to demand that the defendants appear in person for the proceedings , the court official told Reuters . 
Yemen was formed in 1990 by the merger of the conservative north and the Marxist south . 
the two-month war between separatist forces led by former vice president Ali Salem al-Baidh and government forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh ended in July 1994 when Saleh &apos;s forces captured Aden , declared capital of a separatist state . 
southern leaders fled to different countries . 
the exiled leaders said in a conference in Cyprus in April they did not trust the government to give them a fair trial . 
a summons by the office of the public prosecutor in June said the 15 &quot; committed criminal acts with the aim of harming the unity of the country ... and violating the constitution by announcing the crime of secession &quot; .
