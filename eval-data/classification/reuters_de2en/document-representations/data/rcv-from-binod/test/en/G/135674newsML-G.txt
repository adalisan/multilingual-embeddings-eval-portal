Seve Ballesteros and Bernhard Langer , two of Europe &apos;s finest players , have one last chance to rescue otherwise forgettable seasons at the Volvo Masters starting on Thursday . 
while Colin Montgomerie need only strike a single blow to confirm his fourth successive season of pre-eminence in Europe , Ballesteros and Langer will be seeking to prove they can still be forces in the game . 
the 39-year-old Spaniard has never really regained the form which made him one of the world &apos;s foremost players for almost two decades since taking a five-month break from golf after last year &apos;s Ryder Cup match . 
this year he stands 72nd on the money list , his lowest position since he turned professional in 1974 and finished 118th in the order of merit . 
there have been slight recent signs he is making a recovery , notably joint fourth position in the European Masters in Switzerland last month and third place two weeks ago in the Oki pro-am in Spain . 
but he has not won the Masters title in its eight years and would love a victory to keep alive his hope of being Europe &apos;s playing captain at next year &apos;s Ryder Cup on this course . 
Langer has won here in 1994 when he also set a Valderrama course record of 62 , a score few thought possible on the demanding layout in southern Spain . 
now he must win again to extend a record which his seen him win a European Tour event every year for 16 seasons , 17 if the 1979 under-25 championship is counted . 
a play-off defeat by Robert Allenby of Australia in the French Open in June is as close as he has come this year as assorted injuries and putting problems have plagued him . 
now he has sore shoulders and a finger joint that hurts every time he hits a ball . 
&quot; My back is fairly good but I have had a bit of a problem with my shoulders the last few days . 
they &apos;re knotty and tense but hopefully they will get better each day , &quot; he said on Wednesday . 
he said the joint on the fourth finger of his right hand &quot; is painful every time I hit a shot . 
&quot; I guess I should take a few weeks off to rest it , but otherwise I feel all right , &quot; Langer added , saying he intended to stick with the broom-handled putter he began using earlier this year to cure his troubles on the greens . 
Montgomerie leads Ian Woosnam by some 175,000 pounds ( $ 279,500 ) on the money list with a first prize of 150,000 pounds ( $ 240,000 ) on offer here . 
but there is a bonus pool to be distributed to the leading 15 on the list after the tournament - on condition they play in the event - and Woosnam could in theory overhaul his rival if Montgomerie did not play . 
so Montgomerie will be assured of his 150,000 pounds ( $ 240,000 ) in bonus money when he hits his first shot . 
if he were also to win the tournament , his earnings for the year would make him the first player to pass one million pounds in official money in a single season . 
Woosnam , meanwhile , was wearing an elastic brace on Wednesday to protect his back which has been troubling him in recent weeks - and which may have cost him a chance of winning the money title . 
Allenby , third on the money-list , was expected to arrive in Valderrama late on Wednesday , prepared to hit one shot that will guarantee him his bonus reward of 73,000 pounds ( $ 117,000 ) . 
Allenby is recovering from a car accident which left him with a broken breast bone and will be playing against doctor &apos;s orders . 
tour officials refused to give Allenby a dispensation from the rule stating a player must play to collect the bonus , so Allenby is expected to hit a solitary shot to protect his reward .
