President Slobodan Milosevic has made his first significant concession after 52 days of street protests , admitting that the opposition won disputed municipal elections in Serbia &apos;s second city of Nis . 
but the opposition has vowed no letup in demonstrations and Belgrade students plan a blockade on Thursday to test the will of police barring the path of their daily protest marches . 
&quot; suppose Milosevic takes from you $ 10,000 and after 50 days of demonstrating he accepts finally to give you back $ 6,000 , would you be ready to accept this ? 
&quot; said Vuk Draskovic , one leader of the Zajedno ( Together ) opposition coalition . 
official news agency Tanjug said the government agreed that Zajedno had won Nis after a Justice Ministry inquiry ordered by Milosevic last month . 
&quot; On the basis of documents inspected by the Justice Ministry , the Zajedno political organization won 37 seats , the Socialist Party of Serbia ( SPS ) 32 and the Serbian Radical Party one seat in Nis local council , &quot; Tanjug said . 
Zajedno leaders vowed protests would continue and said they had won 41 council seats , not 37 . 
Milosevic has come under strong pressure from the United States and other countries who have warned he cannot expect financial aid to resume unless he respects democracy . 
Tanjug &apos;s report was the lead item on state television &apos;s main news , which has barely mentioned the protests . 
demonstrators nightly bang pots and pans and blow whistles during the broadcast , symbolically drowning out the sound . 
Zajedno &apos;s legal service spokeswoman , Vesna Rakic-Vodinelic , said it remained to be seen whether the SPS-dominated electoral commission would heed the central government &apos;s decision . 
Tanjug said that aside from Nis , &quot; the government would like to make clear that every irregularity established , regardless of protests , will be rectified in keeping with the law and within legal institutions &quot; . 
an inquiry by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) verified the opposition &apos;s claims of fraud . 
the government responded last week by admitting Zajedno had won in nine wards of Belgrade and three smaller provincial cities . 
but it said nothing about Belgrade &apos;s policy-making municipal assembly and contended that in the other cities no party won a majority or the results were inconclusive and required further examination . 
protesters on foot and in cars defied police cordons to jam central Belgrade for several hours on Wednesday afternoon . 
drivers pretending their cars had broken down stopped on main roads around the city , setting up red emergency triangles and peering at their engines in mock concern . 
on Thursday , the students plan to line up in front of the police cordon from about midday ( 1100 GMT ) and stay until the police give in and let them pass . 
groups of about 100 will rotate every hour . 
&quot; We shall form teams and take turns standing opposite the cordon for as long as it takes , &quot; said student protest leader Dusan Vasiljevic . 
the students &apos; encounters with police have so far been good-natured . 
at their daily demonstration on Wednesday , they at one point managed to pass through a gap in the police cordon and come up on them from behind . 
students distributed a leaflet asking the people of Belgrade to turn out to support them on Thursday . 
&quot; Our professors , bishops of our church and academicians will be together with us . 
we will stand in a quiet and dignified way in front of the police cordon until it moves away , &quot; it said .
