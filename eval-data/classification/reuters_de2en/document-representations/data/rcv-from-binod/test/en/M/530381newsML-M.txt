the Bank of Canada on Wednesday set reverse repurchase agreements at 2.75 percent in the Canadian money market , dealers said . 
the intervention came after the call loan rate fell to the bottom of the central bank &apos;s 2.75-3.25 target range for the rate because of excess liquidity in the system . 
one dealer said the intervention was likely caused by dislocations in the cash settlement system and the Bank of Canada was simply confirming its target for the overnight rate . 
Canada &apos;s three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 3.17 percent in the wake of the intervention .
