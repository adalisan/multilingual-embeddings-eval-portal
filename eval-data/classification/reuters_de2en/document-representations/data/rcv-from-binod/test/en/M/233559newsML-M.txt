Indian global depositary receipts ( GDRs ) skidded in thin London trade as cement , steel and automakers were pounded for the third day this week and the prices of other counters were marked down in sympathy . 
&quot; This is an appalling market . 
selling starts in Hong Kong and there are just no buyers in Europe or the U.S. , &quot; said a trader . 
the HSBC James Capel Indian GDR index closed down 2.45 points , 4.47 percent , at 52.33 points , with the premium over the local market sliding to 13.39 percent from yesterday &apos;s 16.34 percent . 
the Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index fell 52.94 points , or 1.89 percent to 2,754.06 and a late rally in Bombay failed to staunch the level of markdowns in London counters . 
&quot; The only buying I have seen here is market makers covering positions and that has been in very small amounts , &quot; said the trader . 
among major losers , Larsen &amp; Toubro lost $ 1.77 to $ 10.60 / $ 11.60 . 
&quot; The locals will turn better at some stage because traders will need to cover their shorts , but whether that will be a sustained bounce is anyone &apos;s guess , &quot; said a trader . 
the Capel Korea GDR Index ended down 1.28 points , 2.02 percent , at 62.14 , a premium of 27.29 percent over the local market after the Korea composite Index ended down 9.72 points at a provisional 715.87 . 
the Capel Taiwan GDR Index ended flat at 96.63 , a premium of 4.07 percent after after the Taiwan weighted Index rose 7.25 points to 6,943.64 .
