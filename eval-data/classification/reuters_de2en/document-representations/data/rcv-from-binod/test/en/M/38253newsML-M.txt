the mark sank to session lows against its European stablemates in late trade , with the French franc shooting through 3.42 per mark as mark / Paris longs found themselves squeezed out . 
&quot; ( Mark / Paris ) is the one people have been gunning for for the last couple of weeks and they &apos;ve got themselves a bit too long , &quot; said a trader at a German bank here . 
dealers cited talk that a UK corporate had been selling the cross in sizeable amounts every 10 ticks . 
players were also wary of shorting francs ahead of the European Union &apos;s monetary committee meeting on monetary union on Monday , they said . 
the franc had bounded as far as 3.4160 / 65 per mark by 1413 GMT , up from late Thursday &apos;s European level of 3.4214 / 19 and a far cry from the nearly seven-month low of 3.4315 it hit early yesterday , prompting Bank of France intervention . 
but traders and analysts were far from convinced that the beleaguered franc was now in the clear . 
&quot; It looks as if ( the mark &apos;s ) got another move on the downside to square the last remaining long positions , and then we &apos;re clear to go back up again , &quot; said one London-based dealer . 
analysts said worries over the French government &apos;s ability to meet the stiff monetary union criteria would also persist . 
the French are already looking for sleight of hand to get the deficit down to their targetted figure , &quot; said Keith Edmonds , chief analyst at IBJ International in London . 
France &apos;s government has forecast a total public deficit of four percent of GDP in 1996 and three in 1997 , down from five percent in 1995 . 
but the market fears labour and social unrest will upset the drive to meet monetary union targets . 
&quot; Whatever the government announces , I &apos;m sure the opposition to a number of their measures will be quite vocal , and that &apos;s bound to disturb franc assets , &quot; Edmonds said . 
France &apos;s Finance Minister Jean Arthuis today said the 1997 budget would forecast growth of 2.3 percent , and confirmed that he envisaged 1996 growth of 1.3 percent . 
the 1997 budget -- due to be presented to the cabinet on September 18 -- will increase taxes on alcohol and tobacco to help fund the welfare system , Arthuis said . 
the Italian lira firmed to 1013.15 / 50 per mark by 1431 GMT from Thursday &apos;s European close of 1017.70 / 8.00 , while the Swedish crown rose to 4.4690 / 20 from 4.4725 / 55 . 
Spain &apos;s peseta climbed a little , but its gains were unspectacular as budget jitters took their toll there too . 
Spanish markets buzzed with talk , centred on a newspaper story , that the government would use portions of tariffs on regulated sectors to help pay the public deficit . 
the Economy Ministry denied the report , which sent shares in sectors such as electricity and gas tumbling . 
the peseta was quoted at 84.41 / 43 per mark by 1444 GMT compared to 84.52 / 53 in late Europe yesterday .
