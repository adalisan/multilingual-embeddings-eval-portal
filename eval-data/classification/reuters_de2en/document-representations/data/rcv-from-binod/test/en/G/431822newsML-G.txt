Hong Kong schoolbooks that do not conform with China &apos;s principles should be revised after the British colony returns to Beijing rule on July 1 , Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said on Monday . 
some textbooks went against the Basic Law , Hong Kong &apos;s future constitution , and the &quot; One Country , Two Systems &quot; principle designed to let the territory keep its capitalist ways after the handover , Qian said . 
&quot; The contents of some textbooks currently used in Hong Kong do not accord with history or reality , are not suited to the changes after 1997 , contradict the spirit of &apos; One Country Two Systems &apos; and the Basic Law , and must be revised , &quot; he said . 
Qian , speaking to the National People &apos;s Congress , China &apos;s parliament , gave no details of which schoolbooks would have to be changed or in what way they contradicted the Basic Law or were otherwise unsuitable . 
Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 under a Sino-British accord that lets the territory keep its capitalist system and a &quot; high degree &quot; of autonomy for 50 years after the transfer of power . 
the Hong Kong Preparatory Committee had raised the issue of textbook content during its work to pave the way to the territory &apos;s handover , Qian said . 
the committee is a body appointed by China to deal with issues related to the transfer of power . 
in his report to parliament on the committee &apos;s work , Qian defended Beijing &apos;s decision to dismantle Hong Kong &apos;s legislature , saying British obstinacy destroyed a consensus that would have allowed it to continue making laws after the end of colonial rule . 
Britain has criticised China &apos;s plan to replace Hong Kong &apos;s elected Legislative Council with its own hand-picked body , the Provisional Legislature , after the handover , saying this was a breach of the territory &apos;s Basic Law . 
Qian said London had made it impossible to abide by arrangements to retain the existing council by pushing for political reforms ahead of the transfer of power . 
China has come under fire for moves to repeal Hong Kong legislation protecting civil rights , but Qian said Britain had also caused that problem by introducing its Bill of Rights ordinance without Beijing &apos;s approval .
