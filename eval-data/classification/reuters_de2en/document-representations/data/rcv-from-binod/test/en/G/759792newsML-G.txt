plastic models , political exhortations and a prize-winning army chef were all on show on Monday as China hailed its rapidly-modernising armed forces with an exhibition on development in the world &apos;s largest military . 
authorities launched the Exhibition on New-Era Construction of the People &apos;s Liberation Army last week as a showcase celebrating the three-million-strong PLA &apos;s advance towards mastery of the hardware and tactics of modern warfare . 
while displays lauded China &apos;s new appliance of military science , politics were also much on display -- with a high profile given to the thoughts and words of President Jiang Zemin , a leader who has worked hard to win military loyalties . 
plastic models of the navy &apos;s newest frigates and the air force &apos;s fastest fighter planes were the closest visitors got to the kind of advanced PLA weaponry that has sent shivers through security circles in the Asia-Pacific region . 
much was made of the role played by the former revolutionary red army , which celebrates its 70th birthday on August 1 , in anti-poverty campaigns , sheep-tending and fire-fighting . 
even army chef Li Chunxiang was given a small display showing off his skills at carving water melons . 
&quot; China has made a lot of progress in modernising its military , &quot; said one soldier from the PLA &apos;s Beijing garrison assigned to help staff the exhibition . 
&quot; Of course some of the most advanced stuff is not on show here because it is secret , &quot; he said . 
military analysts say China &apos;s military modernisation programme has been given a huge boost by generals and leaders shocked by the display of military might put on by Western nations during the 1991 Gulf War . 
while much of the nation &apos;s armed forces remain relatively backward , pockets of excellence have been developed among its nuclear , naval and air force arms -- and Beijing has vowed to attract overseas investment to help develop new weapons . 
the prospect of a PLA able to project its power far beyond China &apos;s borders has raised concerns among regional neighbours , many of whom have lingering border disputes with Beijing . 
high-technology training was a vital part of the development of a modern military , said one officer at the exhibition as he showed off a display of computer simulators designed to hone the skills of pilots , tank commanders and warship crews . 
a virtual-reality simulator with a three-dimensional headset allowed trainee aviators to practise in-flight refuelling -- a skill that would give China &apos;s warplanes new regional clout -- with what staff called total realism . 
&quot; It &apos;s just like the real thing , &quot; said the officer , who declined to be identified . 
&quot; You can even use it to play golf . 
most visitors to the exhibition in Beijing &apos;s Soviet-style military museum flocked to video screens showing missile launches or mock air-assaults , but some displays seemed more about commerce than combat . 
slick Western suits and popular headache tablets produced by military-run ventures illustrated the economic clout and profit-making prowess of the PLA &apos;s vast business empire . 
despite the clear technical transformation achieved by the PLA in its 70-year journey from peasant-backed militia to modern-day military , not all visitors were impressed . 
&quot; Actually , I feel our military development has been a bit too slow , &quot; said one 24-year-old Beijing entrepreneur . 
&quot; Overall , the weapons are not so advanced ... we should develop faster .
