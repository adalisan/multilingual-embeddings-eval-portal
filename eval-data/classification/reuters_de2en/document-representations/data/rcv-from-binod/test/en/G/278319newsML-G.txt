researchers said on Thursday they had identified one of the genes that help a mouse &apos;s brain build mental maps and confirmed the location in the brain where that work is done . 
in three papers to be published in Friday &apos;s edition of the journal Cell , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists describe how they pinpointed a gene responsible for the spatial maps . 
they said their finding could be useful one day in treating such diseases as Alzheimer &apos;s , Parkinson &apos;s and Huntington &apos;s , which slowly destroy the human brain . 
it also appears to confirm a 47-year-old theory that memories are made by strengthening the chemical connections between individual brain cells . 
&quot; It is the first time we have ever ( scientifically ) observed bad memory and good memory , &quot; said team member Susumu Tonegawa , a biologist and 1987 Nobel Prize winner . 
Charles Stevens of the Salk Institute called the work &quot; a big step &quot; in the direction of helping researchers understand memory from the molecular level to the level of individual behaviour . 
the MIT work involved some significant new twists on a well-established technique of selectively knocking out specific genes in cells . 
the so-called knockout technique allows scientists to discern the role of the deleted gene by seeing how the resulting animal develops and functions . 
in their experiments , biologist Matthew Wilson and his colleagues knocked out the gene responsible for a protein that studs the surface of a nerve cell . 
that protein , known as an NMDA receptor , picks up chemical messages from other nerve cells . 
usually changes made with the knockout technique affect all cells in the body . 
when that has been tried in the past all the animals lacking NMDA receptors usually died within a few days . 
what was different about this work was that the team was able to knock out the NMDA receptor from one particular type of nerve cell in the hippocampus , the portion of the brain known to create mental maps . 
scientists believe humans learn by strengthening the connections between individual nerve cells in the brain , creating stronger pathways for the electrical signals , and that those pathways are perceived as memories . 
the Wilson team discovered that when the NMDA receptors in the hippocampus , a wedge of the brain located just behind each ear , were knocked out , the mice had a harder time creating a mental map of their environment . 
while normal mice quickly learned how to swim to a submerged platform , the knockout mice were unable to find the platform because they could not learn the layout of their maze . 
&quot; The mutant mice swam all over the place , telling us they did not have this spatial memory , &quot; team member Patricio Huerta said . 
although there are no immediate practical applications for the work , the researchers suggest the findings might someday be useful in studying drug addiction as well as in treating degenerative brain diseases .
