a Czech deputy prime minister at the centre of a spying scandal called on Thursday for a non-partisan head of the BIS state intelligence agency , but said the row would not affect Senate elections this weekend . 
a Prague newspaper also reported on Thursday that BIS acting director Stanislav Devaty , forced to quit on Monday over the scandal , would sue the opposition Social Democrats for alleging that the agency spied on leading party members . 
with tempers ragged before the polls , the Social Democrats and junior parties in the coalition government have accused Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and his Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) of treating the agency like a private fiefdom . 
Christian Democrat chairman Josef Lux , who triggered the scandal last week , said on Thursday that Devaty &apos;s replacement as spymaster needed to be acceptable to all leading parties including the Social Democrats . 
&quot; I think that more than one political party must have confidence in this man , &quot; he told Radio Nova Alfa . 
&quot; I even believe that more ( parties ) than only the coalition ... including part of the opposition ... should have a say about this person . 
the Christian Democrats and the other junior coalition partner , the Civic Democratic Alliance , have been trying for at least two years to oust Devaty , who is a protege of Klaus . 
LUX , one of four deputy prime ministers , aimed his comments at Klaus &apos;s ODS . 
Devaty is a former ODS member who suspended his membership when he became head of the intelligence agency . 
LUX , who is also agriculture minister , accused the BIS last Friday of spying on him and concealing the operation from the cabinet and a parliamentary committee overseeing the agency . 
Klaus said a BIS agent in the Agriculture Ministry had not been spying on Lux but on one of his advisers , who was also director of a bank which collapsed amid fraud charges . 
the scandal escalated in the hothouse atmosphere before the Senate polls , the first test of public opinion since the coalition lost its majority in lower house elections in June . 
social Democrat chairman Milos Zeman , a personal enemy of the prime minister , accused the BIS of following himself and other leading party colleagues . 
he also alleged that agents had visited his elderly mother seeking compromising information on him . 
Klaus said the allegation was a fabrication . 
LUX said he doubted the scandal would have a major influence on the upper house elections on Friday and Saturday , with a second round runoff a week later . 
&quot; The affair around BIS will probably not influence the Senate elections , &quot; he said . 
the Prague daily Lidove Noviny reported on Thursday that Devaty had decided to sue the Social Democrats for five million crowns ( $ 186,100 ) over Zeman &apos;s allegations . 
the former acting spy chief said he was being accused of trying to re-establish a totalitarian police state seven years after the fall of communism .
