new York - The dollar ended a volatile week mixed Friday as traders squared their books and the German mark rose against a broad array of currencies . 
a government report showing builders broke more ground for new homes in April than in March failed to provide direction . 
market participants also played down rumours that some European central banks , the Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan were buying dollars for yen . 
this talk of central bank intervention to bolster the dollar emerged at the end of a week in which the dollar tumbled to its lowest level in more than four months . 
since reaching a 4-1 / 2 year high of 127.45 yen on May 1 , the dollar has declined some 10 percent against the Japanese currency . 
the dollar dipped briefly to 114.87 yen Friday then rebounded to fetch 115.63 yen in late New York trading , down from 115.97 yen on Thursday . 
&quot; They &apos;ve been selling all week . 
it &apos;s just squaring up here , &quot; said Robert Ryan , manager of corporate foreign exchange at the Bank of New York . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s just been a very long week and everyone &apos;s slowing down . 
the mark rose against the yen , the Italian lira , French franc , and British pound . 
analysts said mark gains against these currencies helped boost it against the dollar . 
the dollar settled at 1.6926 marks in New York , down from 1.6980 marks late on Thursday . 
it fell to 1.4203 Swiss francs from 1.4305 francs , but rose to Canadian $ 1.3738 from C $ 1.3713 . 
the British pound ended at $ 1.6365 , down from $ 1.6427 . 
the mark gained against European currencies a day after German Finance Minister Theo Waigel told parliament that tax revenues for 1997 would be 18 billion marks ( $ 10.6 billion ) less than expected . 
this tax shortfall could hinder Germany &apos;s efforts to qualify for the proposed single European currency . 
doubts about plans for the single European currency , also known as Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , often boost the mark , which is viewed as a safe haven in currency in Europe . 
part of the reason why the mark strengthened &quot; may have to do with the issue of the tax shortfall and some concern over EMU in general . 
and obviously that raises the spectre of it getting delayed or not happening at all , &quot; said David Solin , a partner at Foreign Exchange analytics . 
Solin also attributed the mark &apos;s rise to profit-taking in other currencies ahead of a holiday on Monday . 
financial markets in many European countries will be closed for the Whit holiday . 
on Tuesday , the Fed &apos;s policy-making Federal Open Market Comittee meets to debate another rise in interest rates . 
the central bank raised short-term rates a quarter point to 5.50 percent on March 25 . 
market participants were divided over what the central bank will decide to do . 
&quot; I &apos;d say the market is split on the Fed fifty-fifty , &quot; said Marc Chandler , a senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
Chandler said the housing data were not all that important because they did not change the perception that the economy is relatively robust . 
the Commerce Department said housing starts rose 2.6 percent in April from the previous month .
