LIFFE cocoa futures saw late short-covering late on Friday to end flat to slightly higher nearly across the board . 
July closed steady at 995 stg per tonne and September gained three to 1,019 . 
total volume stood at 6,407 contracts but most of that was seen in crosses . 
traders said crosses included 700 July / September contracts traded at 22 stg , 600 September / March and 600 May 1998 traded to help lift volume . 
in outright activity , they said a commission house bought at least 600 contracts distributed between September , December , March and May . 
they speculated the buying was for a single trade house . 
but nearby months spent most of the day in negative ground due to more fund and speculator liquidation . 
floor sources said traders seemed to have underestimated the size of long positions held in London and were caught off guard . 
they said traders had expected about 3,000 to 4,000 lots to be liquidated but have so far , received about double that . 
that has spurred some to believe a long July holder took advantage of the liquidation to hide a rollover of long Julys into forward months . 
they noted that the September / December spread has remained little changed compared to other spreads . 
September / December closed at one stg versus July / September &apos;s 24 , December / March &apos;s 12 and March / May &apos;s 11 . 
they said a fairer value for September / December in relation to the other spreads would normally be closer to 11 . 
though most of the July liquidation has occurred this week , traders speculated there was more to go . 
some estimated another few thousand longs had to be flushed out of the market , which would keep prices pressured . 
most traders expected July to revisit the April 9 low of 980 though July has resisted breaking that level three times in the past two months . 
if 980 fails to hold , they expected to hit sell-stops and then a rash of fresh selling from funds and speculators . 
but they said the bulk of sales may be seen in September instead of July as September edges closer to overtaking the front-month position . 
on the charts , technical analysts did not see any solid support for July until about 950 if 980 breaks . 
July and September each traded about 1,345 contracts to lead volume . 
options volume was nil .
