Shanghai copper futures ended down sharply on Thursday in active trading with later maturing contracts hitting a 1996 low on falls on the London metals Exchange and an expectation of further falls to come , traders said . 
the most active February 1997 contract ended at 18,930 yuan ( $ 2,281 ) per tonne , losing 570 yuan . 
it opened at 19,300 yuan , hitting an intra-day high of 19,370 and a low of 18,900 .

combined volume rose sharply to 147,350 tonnes from 31,240 . 
copper opened lower due to overnight losses on the London Metal Exchange and fell further with most contracts closing at or near their intra-day lows . 
traders said LME losses triggered expectation of further falls over the next few days and a significant quantity of &quot; hot money &quot; surged into the metals market as speculators built short positions . 
&quot; Many investors expect copper to breach the $ 1,900 support level on the LME , and speculators built large short positions at high levels today , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Later-maturing contracts found some support at the 19,000 yuan level , which indicated long position holders hoped the LME could move back above the $ 1,900 level , &quot; he added . 
analysts said copper will fall sharply if LME breaches the $ 1,900 level tonight , otherwise it will meet resistance at 19,500 yuan .
