Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing said Wednesday it has signed an 18-month , $ 3 million contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to explore the feasibility of developing a thin film tape to conduct electricity . 
Minnesota Mining , Southwire Co and research at two Department of Energy labs will examine the feasibility of developing the new high-temperature superconductor , which it said could increase the carrying capacity of electricity by 100 times over traditional copper and aluminum wire . 
the effort is part of the DOE &apos;s national Superconductivity Program for Electric Power Systems , Minnesota Mining said . 
&quot; If there is a way to scale up production of this technology for commercial use , its potential in applications like motors , generators , transformers , current limiters , underground power cables and magnetic energy storage is incredible , &quot; William Coyne , senior vice president , 3m Research and Development , said in a news release . 
&quot; For instance , transformers could be produced at half the weight and operate without oil , and far more efficient motors would run more quietly and produce double the output .
