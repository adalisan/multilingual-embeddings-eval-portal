Madrid stocks closed sharply lower on Wednesday after Wall Street &apos;s weaker start paved the way for a much-needed technical correction , dealers said . 
the general index shed 3.87 points , 0.81 percent , to 475.81 and the ibex fell 53.31 points , 0.97 percent , to 5,463.07 . 
sentiment was somewhat nervous amid volatility , but fund flows underpinning bullish sentiment still persist . 
the fact that the Telefonica retail share offering had been so popular was one proof of underlying strength , dealers said , although Telefonica shed 25 pesetas to 3,370 in line with the market today . 
but the bourse needed to pull back and consolidate . 
&quot; We &apos;ve shown signs of fatigue since Monday , and that &apos;s been behind the volatility . 
with Wall Street &apos;s lower open that was all we needed for a technical slide , &quot; said a dealer . 
dealers said buying on the part of domestic funds is still underpinning prices . 
&quot; The only risk is one of a sharp correction across the Atlantic , in which case we &apos;ll go down heavily too , &quot; one said .
