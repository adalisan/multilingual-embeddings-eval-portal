Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Thursday said he wants to visit Lima as soon as possible to thank Peru for resolving the hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence . 
&quot; I would like to visit Peru and only Peru to express our gratitude , &quot; Hashimoto told a meeting with the parliamentary alliance led by his Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . 
the Foreign Ministry said no firm date was set for such a visit . 
on Wednesday , Hashimoto said it would be impolite to add a Lima stop to the Washington trip he leaves for on Thursday . 
&quot; A visit of that kind to Peru should not be tagged on at the end of another trip , &quot; he told a news conference soon after Peruvian commandos raided the residence and freed 71 hostages . 
one hostage , two commandos and all 14 Marxist guerrillas died in the attack . 
Hashimoto leaves for Washington later on Thursday for talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton . 
he is due to visit Australia and New Zealand after that . 
Japan &apos;s Foreign Ministry issued a warning on Thursday to its 182 embassies and missions and Japanese nationals abroad of possible retaliatory attacks by the MRTA and supporters . 
in Thursday &apos;s meeting , LDP Upper House leader Masakuni Murakami proposed inviting President Alberto Fujimori for a state visit , alliance officials said . 
Hashimoto also thanked Canada and Cuba for their help in the four-month affair while Japan &apos;s parliament adopted a resolution thanking Peru . 
&quot; I would like to thank Peru from the bottom of my heart for thoroughly preparing for the raid and successfully freeing most of the hostages , &quot; Hashimoto told the Lower House of parliament . 
&quot; We were helped by Canada , especially by Canadian ambassador Vincent to the very end of the affair , &quot; Hashimoto told Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on the telephone . 
Ambassador Anthony Vincent , originally a hostage himself , was one of three members of a top mediators &apos; group which was trying to achieve a bloodless end to the crisis . 
Hashimoto was also preparing to send a letter of thanks to Cuban President Fidel Castro , government sources said . 
Cuba said it would have taken in the Marxist rebels if they had agreed on a deal to release the hostages in exchange for safe passage to a foreign country . 
Japanese newspapers on Thursday said Japan &apos;s own record of going soft on terrorism in general may have brought about the crisis . 
&quot; Perhaps the MRTA ( Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ) side had this optimistic notion that Japan , which persistently demanded a peaceful resolution , would prevent Peru from storming the residence , &quot; said the Yomiuri Shimbun , Japan &apos;s largest circulation daily . 
&quot; Japan should adopt a stiff attitude against terrorism to get rid of such an image , &quot; the Yomiuri said in an editorial . 
the Tokyo Shimbun said the world focused on Japan &apos;s behaviour in the crisis because of suspicions that Tokyo may once again give in to guerrilla demands . 
&quot; The world began to focus its attention on Japan because in the past , our country gave in to terrorists without principle , having put too much weight on saving the lives of hostages , &quot; the Tokyo Shimbun editorial said .
