the Lev fell to 283-285 per dollar at the close of the interbank market from 277-280 in the morning as foreign currency demand heavily topped supply despite dollar sales by the central bank , dealers said . 
&quot; A strong dollar-bullish sentiment persisted throughout the day while supply from commercial banks was very low , &quot; a bank dealer said . 
interbank trade was rather nervous as growing pressure on the Lev was carried over from the cash market amid Bulgarians &apos; concerns about the safety of their Lev savings under a currency board system being discussed for Bulgaria . 
&quot; If it was not for central bank sales the dollar could have risen by some 10-15 levs today , &quot; another dealer said . 
the central bank sold light foreign currency volumes at 276-278 levs per dollar on the interbank market , slowing down the fall , traders said . 
Central bank officials were not available for comment . 
people queued outside branches of the State Savings Bank ( SSB ) to withdraw Lev deposits and stack them at home or convert them into hard currency out of fear they might lose their savings under a currency board system , traders said . 
more than four billion levs were withdrawn from the SSB by panic-stricken Bulgarians since early last week , but queues were starting to die down , SSB head Bistra Dimitrova told Reuters on Tuesday . 
an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) mission , which left last week , proposed setting up of a currency board to stabilise the Lev , to defeat hyperinflation and to boost economic growth . 
under the scheme the Lev is to be pegged to a major currency and the amount of levs in circulation must be exactly matched by the central bank &apos;s foreign currency reserves .
