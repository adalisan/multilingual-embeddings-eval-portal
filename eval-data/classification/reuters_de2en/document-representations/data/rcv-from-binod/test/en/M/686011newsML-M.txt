Indonesian tyre-grader SIR20 rubber prices softened in late trading amid bearish market sentiment , traders said . 
they said deals were done at 45.00 U.S. cents / lb fob Surabaya and Palembang for August shipment . 
offer prices in other centres were generally softer following the deals . 
&quot; In general , many traders believe Indonesian prices cannot compete with offer prices in Thailand or Malaysia because we are still engaged in long-term contracts , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; It means of traders in those countries are offering rubber at much cheaper prices , we just can &apos;t follow suit . 
we also expect offer prices will fall again tomorrow because of slow demand and bearish market sentiment , &quot; he added . 
traders said offer prices were quoted at 45.125 cents / lb fob Medan , 44.875 fob Padang , 45.00 fob Surabaya and Palembang and 44.50 fob Pontianak and Jambi . 
traders earlier expected offer prices to fall to as low as 44.00 as the market continued to experience a lack of fresh leads .
