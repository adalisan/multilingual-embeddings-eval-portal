Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted on Friday as saying he opposed full Palestinian sovereignty and preferred a self-rule entity on the model of Puerto Rico or Andorra . 
&quot; I am against complete sovereignty and unrestrained self-determination , &quot; Netanyahu said in remarks published in Israel &apos;s Haaretz newspaper . 
&quot; A model is necessary that will allow the national group to manage itself without bringing the break-up of the state in which it lives and without threatening the majority , &quot; the paper quoted Netanyahu as telling a group of foreign diplomats . 
he proposed &quot; a model of a state like Puerto Rico or Andorra &quot; . 
a senior Palestinian described Netanyahu &apos;s reported remarks as &quot; arrogant &quot; and &quot; irrelevant . 
&quot; We are not tailoring our political desires to his desires . 
the reality is more solid and stubborn than Netanyahu &apos;s arrogance , &quot; Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan Asfour told Reuters . 
Puerto Rico is an autonomous commonwealth in association with the United States . 
Andorra is a tiny mountainous principality between France and Spain famous for its ski resorts . 
the Palestinians have won limited autonomy in much of the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank . 
they and Arab states have become frustrated with the near standstill in peace moves since Netanyahu won Israel &apos;s elections , ousting a centre-left government that had conducted negotiations on the principle of trading occupied Arab land for peace . 
Netanyahu opposes trading land for peace . 
his government is locked in talks with the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) on implementing a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron signed by the previous government .
