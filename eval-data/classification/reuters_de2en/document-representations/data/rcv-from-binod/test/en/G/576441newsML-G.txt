Gaullist National Assembly President Philippe Seguin , a past Euro-sceptic and a possible successor to Prime Minister Alain Juppe , said on Monday he favoured both European integration and an independent France . 
&quot; We want Europe , but we also want a France which continues to exist , &quot; Seguin said at a campaign rally for centre-right candidates . 
&quot; The nation will for a long time yet remain the irreplaceable framework for the exercise of our citizenship , &quot; he said . 
later , Seguin told France 2 television that Italy must be included from the start in a single European currency . 
if not , he said , a devaluation in the lire would occur which would aggravate the problem of high unemployment in Europe . 
Europe is a major issue in France &apos;s May 25-June 1 snap parliamentary election . 
the centre-right government has reaffirmed its commitment to a single European currency from 1999 , which could require more austerity to limit public deficits to the three percent of gross domestic product France needs to qualify from the start . 
the opposition Socialists have said they would go ahead with monetary union only if it served the interests of the French people and did not harm efforts to reduce record 12.8 percent unemployment . 
the Communists , who are likely to participate in a coalition government should the left win the election , oppose monetary union and have pressed the Socialists to take a stronger stand against it . 
Seguin was one of the leaders of a campaign to defeat a 1992 referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European integration . 
the treaty was approved in France by a thin margin . 
but lately he has fallen more in line with the majority . 
&quot; Yes , we want France to be involved in Europe , &quot; Seguin said . 
&quot; It is not through less Europe but through a better Europe that we will best preserve our identity , our values , our ability to act , &quot; he told the rally . 
Seguin acknowledged he occasionally veered from the party line but said he was committed to the policies of Gaullist President Jacques Chirac and the current parliamentary majority . 
he said his own economic philosophy was one of liberalism tempered by social protections and the possibility of state intervention . 
concerning a single European currency , he said , &quot; We need the presence of Italy ( from the start ) , first of all for reasons of equilibrium within Europe . 
and if Italy didn &apos;t enter , we would have by definition a lire that would devalue and a very big unemployment problem . 
Seguin poked fun at the &quot; incoherence &quot; of the left &apos;s programme and noted that numerous leftists outside the Socialist Party strongly opposed a single European currency . 
if the left won , &quot; the entire process would grind to a halt and all of the sacrifices made over the last several years , all of the efforts , all of the lost jobs , all of the austerity and the rigour would have been for naught &quot; , he said .
