the U.S. Producer Price Index ( PPI ) probably edged up moderately in January , pointing to stable , but not decelerating , wholesale price trends , economists said . 
in a Reuters poll , economists on average forecast a 0.3 percent rise in the overall PPI and a 0.2 percent increase in the so-called core PPI , the index minus its more volatile food and energy components . 
estimates for the January PPI rise ran as high as 0.6 percent at Nomura Securities International Inc and MCM International Inc , and as low as 0.1 percent at Daiwa Securities America Inc and JP Morgan and Co Inc . 
Elliott Platt , managing director and head of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp , said he expected 0.2 percent gains in both the overall and core PPI . 
he characterized such rises as &quot; obviously non-problematic . 
still , Platt said price trends at the intermediate and crude stages of production might not prove as beneficial for the credit markets as they had been previously . 
&quot; There seems to be a little updrift in some of the industrial materials prices -- in copper , zinc , nickel , &quot; he said . 
at the earlier production stages , the PPI has gone from negative readings to flattish readings , said Platt . 
&quot; The numbers ( at the earlier stages ) remain weak , but they are stabilizing as opposed to weakening further , &quot; he said . 
Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America , expected the overall PPI to be up 0.1 percent and the core PPI to rise 0.2 percent . 
&quot; The information we look at suggests that food and energy prices dipped during the month and will actually be holding down the PPI , &quot; said Moran . 
&quot; We look at the Agriculture Department &apos;s monthly survey of prices , and we look at various measures of gasoline prices , and all of that suggested that food and energy prices moved lower in January , &quot; he said . 
Christopher Rupkey , vice president and financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi , agreed that oil prices should have a beneficial effect on the PPI . 
&quot; The January PPI is due for better numbers just because the oil complex has come down , &quot; said Rupkey , who expects both the PPI and its core index to be up 0.2 percent . 
&quot; It &apos;s too early to see the PPI rise due to firmer commodity prices and more importantly , crude oil has collapsed here , &quot; said Rupkey . 
&quot; The latest ( Federal Reserve ) Beige Book said that the only price pressures evident anywhere were in oil &quot; and now we &apos;re not even going to show that , &quot; said Rupkey . 
&quot; Inflation is very quiet , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There are some signs that wages are up and that could lead to price pressures down the road . 
based on theory , prices should go up , but at the moment , we can &apos;t measure price pressure anywhere in the economy . 
Lee Youngdahl , bond market analyst at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co Inc , also looked for subdued readings in both the overall and core January PPI . 
but he said that does not mean the credit markets can rest easy . 
&quot; You get back to the pace of activity out there ( in the economy ) , &quot; said Youngdahl . 
&quot; That will keep people worried that the trends won &apos;t be as positive in the future as they have been . 
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re going to wake up and all of a sudden see 0.5 percent monthly gains , but you could get into a slowly upwardly grinding situation . 
&quot; The Fed wants to prevent that , &quot; said Youngdahl . 
&quot; They want to be forward-looking and preemptive enough .
