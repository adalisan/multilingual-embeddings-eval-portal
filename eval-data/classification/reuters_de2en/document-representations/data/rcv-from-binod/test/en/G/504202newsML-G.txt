an international row over plans to curb freedoms in Hong Kong is likely to be followed by further political disputes as China prepares to take back the territory from Britain , analysts said on Friday . 
the proposals offered by Hong Kong Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa are intended to carry out policies set by China &apos;s parliament . 
the plans restrict the ability of political parties to obtain donations from overseas and give police increased authority to block political demonstrations . 
the ensuing debate has highlighted the gulf between Tung and his supporters , who emphasise the importance of maintaining social stability and economic progress , and critics who fear that political freedoms and democratic principles will be sacrificed to Beijing &apos;s history of quashing dissent . 
Tung would have to face even thornier issues dealing with electoral reform and defining what constitutes attempts at subverting China &apos;s government , Andy Ho , a columnist with the South China Morning Post , said on Friday . 
&quot; They will be making unpopular moves just as thousands of journalists are arriving to cover the handover , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It will be bad timing . 
Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight on June 30 after more than 150 years of British colonial rule . 
Tung &apos;s plans , which will be subject to public comment , were swiftly attacked by departing British Governor Chris Patten , the United States and pro-democracy Hong Kong politicians . 
even some members of the China-backed provisional legislature , which will replace Hong Kong &apos;s elected Legislative Council , said the proposals might be more stringent than necessary and need to be re-examined . 
by Friday , even Tung &apos;s advisers had conceded it may be necessary to reconsider the plans . 
Michael Suen , Tung &apos;s secretary for policy coordination , promised that officials would take into account comments from the public before finalising the draft . 
the public has been invited to give their views during a consultation period . 
the Post &apos;s Ho said Tung risked damaging the popularity he has enjoyed since his selection in December as the future chief executive . 
&quot; This is the first general issue he has had to face and it has turned out a failure , &quot; Ho said . 
the United States was prominent among critics of the proposed changes . 
President Bill Clinton , who wants to improve ties with China , also told Chinese leaders that Washington would monitor Beijing &apos;s performance in honouring its pledge to preserve the way of life in Hong Kong . 
the territory of 6.4 million people has been promised a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover . 
U.S. Democrats and Republicans found common ground criticising the planned restrictions on civil liberties . 
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Washington wanted China to ensure &quot; Hong Kong will continue to thrive and its people will enjoy the freedoms that they have come to expect &quot; . 
the European Parliament said in a resolution that maintaining political , social and economic freedom in Hong Kong &quot; is a matter of determining importance for the European Union . 
China bristled at what it sees as meddling from outside and from the departing British . 
a foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing said Hong Kong &apos;s future government was justified in making the changes .
