the ringgit was expected to trade in a weak range as dollar / majors were strong , dealers said . 
Downtrending Malaysian interbank rates will also make the ringgit unattractive in the short-term , they said . 
&quot; Dollar / majors were firm overnight and still looks strong , &quot; said a European bank dealer . 
&quot; The market now is on a buying ( dollar / ringgit ) on dips mentality . 
dealers said they expect Malaysian interest rates to return to &quot; normal &quot; levels after sharp hikes recently due to a squeeze of interbank funds . 
&quot; It &apos;s no more attractive to hold ringgit with the rates falling , &quot; said a Malaysian bank dealer . 
the market also eagerly await Malaysian money supply data for April and the first quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) numbers , though no major surprises were expected .
