imprisoned leaders of the main Moslem militant group in Egypt repeated a call on Saturday for a truce in their fight to set up an Islamic government . 
&quot; The Group 81 at Tora prison confirms it insists on its ( truce ) statement . 
that statement was not an outcome of negotiations with security authorities , &quot; said a joint statement read out by a defendant at a military court trial . 
Group 81 refers to leaders of the Gama &apos;a Islamiya ( Islamic Group ) who are serving prison terms connected with the assassination of Egypt &apos;s President Anwar Sadat in 1981 . 
the statement was read out by one of 97 alleged Islamist militants on trial for charges including murder and belonging to an illegal group . 
the defendants have pleaded not guilty . 
the court on Saturday heard defence remarks and examined evidence before it adjourned until July 26 . 
it was the third session in the trial , the largest in Egypt of alleged militants . 
the six imprisoned Gama &apos;a leaders first asked followers to stop unilaterally all violent acts in an appeal read out for them at the start of the trial on July 5 . 
that appeal was later rejected by exiled Gama &apos;a leaders , who replied : &quot; We confirm ... that we will continue our fight . 
but one Islamist known for his close contacts with the Gama &apos;a abroad said he did not see any rift in the group . 
when Yasser el-Sirri , sentenced to death in Egypt and living in exile in Britain , was asked about the exiled leaders &apos; reaction to Saturday &apos;s statement , he told Reuters by telephone : &quot; I do not expect they would change their stand . 
&quot; That ( truce ) statement is their independent reasoning , but it does not change the core of the cause ... this regime ( in Egypt ) is illegal and does not respect human rights . 
the Gama &apos;a has been fighting the security forces since 1992 in a low-level guerrilla war largely confined to southern Egypt . 
more than 1,000 people have been killed in the conflict . 
police say they have broken the back of the military wing of the Gama &apos;a through raids on its hideouts and steps to prevent the organisation receiving help from abroad . 
the number of Gama &apos;a attacks has declined sharply since the mid-1990s , when the militants were killing about one policeman a day . 
in Cairo the organisation tried to kill the prime minister , the interior minister and the information minister .
