Conservative opposition leader Miltiades Evert , popularly known as the &quot; bulldozer &quot; , may be a push away from his 20-year dream of becoming prime minister . 
Evert , head of the New Democracy party , began the campaign for Sunday &apos;s vote as the outsider but his bold promises for more money to low-income earners seem to have paid off . 
he has defied early &quot; no hope &quot; predictions by most political commentators and is now running neck and neck in opinion polls with socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis . 
&quot; He &apos;s been waiting for this moment since he first got into parliament 20 years ago . 
he honestly feels he can change the face of modern Greece , &quot; one of Evert &apos;s close associates told Reuters . 
called the &quot; bulldozer &quot; for his roaring emotional outbursts and stocky build , Evert , 57 , stands apart from other mainstream Greek political leaders . 
he pounds his hand on the table to drive home a point , he has a pet monkey and is notorious for his misuse of the Greek language . 
his verbal blunders frequently make headlines in the Athens press . 
all people make mistakes when they talk and I believe it is better to be spontaneous than to be held back to avoid making any mistakes , &quot; Evert said . 
&quot; I was never good in language courses ... one time one of my teachers returned a corrected composition of mine where everything had been crossed out except the word &apos; and &apos; . 
Evert , an economist , tells voters he will change their lives for the better within 30 days of being elected . 
he promises higher pensions for farmers , less taxes for small businesses , and severe cuts in excessive state spending . 
he sees Greece &apos;s future firmly in the European Union and backs a harder line towards rival Turkey . 
Evert was elected Athens mayor in 1986 when he took on the socialist government of late prime minister Andreas Papandreou and set up the first independent radio station in Greece . 
&quot; That radio station broke the monopoly of state controlled radio and television . 
the same holds now and nothing will stop me from fulfilling my campaign proclamations , &quot; he said . 
Evert was elected New Democracy president in November 1993 replacing former prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis who had suffered a humiliating election defeat by Papandreou a month earlier . 
he has served in many ministerial posts and took advantage of Mitsotakis &apos; low popularity as premier from 1990 to 1993 to climb the party ranks and win support in the party . 
his top advisers and potential ministers include some of Greece &apos;s brightest minds who do not mind serving under a leader characterised more by emotion than reason . 
&quot; His strong will has inspired us all , &quot; one of his economic advisers said . 
&quot; We are all convinced that besides numbers and economic targets Greece needs shock treatment , and Mr Evert is the only politician who has the guts to do it . 
Evert does not come from a political family but his father was chief of police during Greece &apos;s 1941-1944 Nazi occupation and helped many Greek resistance fighters to escape arrest and flee abroad . 
he is married to Lisa Vanderpool , a well-known American photographer , and has two daughters and three granddaughters . 
he says his greatest pleasure is &quot; a couple of plates of spaghetti , with lots of cheese and tomato sauce .
