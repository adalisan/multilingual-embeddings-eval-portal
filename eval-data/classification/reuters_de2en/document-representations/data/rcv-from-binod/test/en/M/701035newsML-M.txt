U.S. stocks edged higher on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged following a two-day meeting of the central bank &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee . 
most U.S. economists had expected the Fed to keep monetary policy unchanged . 
the Dow industrials were up about six points at 7728 after spending most of the day in negative territory . 
the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 was up five to 896 , slightly higher than prior to the announcement . 
the Nasdaq composite was up nine at 1447 , also modestly adding to prior gains . 
-- &quot; The Fed has few reasons to raise rates , there &apos;s not enough inflation to rattle the Fed &apos;s cage . 
the market was beginning to feel comfortable with the fact that interest rates would be unchanged . 
-- &quot; This could bring some bargain hunters out but the market is still somewhat cautious ahead the upcoming stream of second quarter earnings . 
-- &quot; The lack of change in monetary policy and the therapeutic effects of that have been embedded in stock prices for the past three weeks , so we would not expect to see much of a pop in stock prices today . 
-- &quot; But what the stock market is not looking at is the likelihood that the Federal Reserve probably will not raise rates at its August meeting . 
once the bond market comes to this conclusion , stocks should get support . 
-- &quot; The Fed did exactly what everybody expected them to do ... Tomorrow is the important day because of the ( June ) employment numbers . 
if that surprises on the upside , that could hurt the bond market .
