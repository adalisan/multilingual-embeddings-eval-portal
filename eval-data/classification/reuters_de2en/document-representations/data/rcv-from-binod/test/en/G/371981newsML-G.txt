before riots swept this pretty sea-side town , it was best known as the place where Albania declared independence in 1912 and where thousands of people fled the country after a Stalinist regime fell in 1990 . 
Vlore has now become the centre of protest against the government of President Sali Berisha , who is blamed for the failure of get-rich-quick investment schemes which left many Albanians penniless . 
it is the home of schemes such as Vefa , Kamberi , Cenaj , Silva and recently failed Gjallica which prompted luckless investors to riot here this week and demand the resignation of the right-wing government . 
the town was tense but quiet on Wednesday . 
it exists but the people don &apos;t believe this government will give them their money back . 
while he spoke at Vlore &apos;s Independence Square , people began shouting that they wanted their money , not politics . 
&quot; Why don &apos;t you organise demonstrations in Tirana ? 
go there and make people protest , &quot; someone called out . 
for most of the decade , the residents of Albania &apos;s second largest port have lived largely off remittances sent by illegal workers in neighbouring Greece or in Italy across the Adriatic . 
the town is notorious for smuggling drugs and immigrants to neighbouring European Union states , and money earned in these activities may have gone into the investment schemes . 
in 1991 , Vlore grabbed world headlines when thousands of people tried to flee to Italy in commercial ships , fishing trawlers and makeshift rafts . 
as if getting ready to cash in on ferrying another possible wave of refugees , people seized scores of speedboats impounded by Vlore police in past crackdowns on the illegal trade . 
they raided the boat compound after police were driven from Vlore in violent clashes on Monday and Tuesday . 
police were stoned by angry crowds , stripped and then forced to leave . 
refugees streamed out of Albania in 1990 and 1991 after the country emerged from 40 years of strict isolation and Stalinist rule . 
the lucrative immigrant trade continues despite crackdowns , raking in profits and providing a &quot; smokeless industry &quot; for Vlore &apos;s 90,000 residents . 
during the height of the trade in 1993-94 , up to 1,000 Albanians fled each night from Vlore to Italy . 
the skeleton of an 11-storey hotel dominates Independence Square and symbolises the failure of the local economy . 
work started on it in 1984 , but the old Communist regime ran out of cash . 
it is now in the hands of one of the surviving high interest investment schemes . 
Vlore is the closest Albanian town to Italy . 
after gaining independence in 1912 , the Vlore government held office for 14 months while the country became a battlefield of foreign armies during World War One . 
Vlore &apos;s future looked set to be an Italian protectorate but in 1920 the Albanian government organised a revolt which routed Italian troops and assured Vlore stayed a part of Albania .
