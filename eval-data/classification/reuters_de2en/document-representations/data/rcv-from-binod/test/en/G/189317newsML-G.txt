even before he has had a chance to savor his re-election , President Bill Clinton is knee-deep in foreign policy problems in Africa and Bosnia -- and this might be an omen of things to come . 
at a time when he is trying to choose a team for his second term and prepare for an Asian trip starting on Friday , Clinton has been distracted by pressure to send U.S. troops to help ease Zaire &apos;s refugee crisis and continue the NATO-led peacekeeping operation in the Balkans . 
he agreed in principle to the former on Wednesday -- subject to a set of stringent conditions -- and is clearly in favour of the latter . 
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said on Thursday the United States was ready to commit as many as 8,000 troops to a new international force of up to 30,000 that would police the peace in Bosnia next year . 
U.S. officials said the need for immediate presidential action on these issues had slowed the process of putting together a new foreign policy team , which Clinton originally hoped to finish before he left on his 12-day trip . 
but Helmut Sonnenfeldt , an international affairs expert who served in President Richard Nixon &apos;s administration , said Clinton and his advisers had only themselves to blame . 
&quot; They kicked a lot of cans down the road to deal with after the ( Nov . 5 ) election . 
Zaire has been a mess for a while ... and everbody knew what has been accomplished in Bosnia is very fragile , and that there would have to be a continued military mission of some sort , &quot; Sonnenfeldt said . 
but Zaire and Bosnia are just leading indicators of the likely prominence of foreign policy in Clinton &apos;s presidency over the next four years . 
White House insiders see a host of potential problems ranging from rising tensions on the Korean peninsula to Russia &apos;s sensitivity over enlargement of NATO . 
shaky U.S. relations with China , an issue Clinton intends to address at a meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the Asian trade summit in Manila next week , is yet another big item on Clinton &apos;s second term agenda . 
and looming over all else on the foreign policy front is the precarious state of the Middle East peace process . 
U.S. officials believe agreement is imminent on an Israeli troop pullout from Hebron , the last West Bank city under Israeli military rule , but they see many more hurdles ahead . 
it is ironic that foreign policy has become so big a part of the workload for Clinton , a Democrat who came into office in 1993 planning a single-minded focus on domestic policy . 
Stephen Hess , a scholar of the presidency based at the Brookings Institution , a Washington think-tank , said Clinton &apos;s focus on international affairs was likely to become more and more pronounced as his second term unfolded . 
&quot; There &apos;s an old cliche that when presidents cannot run for another term they run for the Nobel Peace Prize . 
they certainly run for their place in history . 
Hess said it was also &quot; easier and neater &quot; for an American president -- particularly a second-term political lame duck like Clinton -- to deal with foreign policy , &quot; where he has power and elbow room , &quot; than it was to wrestle with an opposition-controlled Congress over thorny domestic issues .
