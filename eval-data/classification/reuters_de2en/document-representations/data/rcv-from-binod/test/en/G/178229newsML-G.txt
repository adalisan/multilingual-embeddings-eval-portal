Pakistan manager Mushtaq Mohammad said on Saturday he hoped the singer Champions &apos; trophy defeat by Sri Lanka would serve as &quot; a wake up call &quot; for his batsmen . 
Pakistan , who meet New Zealand on Sunday , were hustled out for 131 to lose by 75 runs to the world champions on Friday . 
&quot; Our bowlers did a great job by bowling out Sri Lanka for a modest score but still we blew the chance , &quot; said Mushtaq . 
&quot; I hope the defeat will serve as a wake up call for the batsmen ... most of the top order went to trash strokes which hardly justifies their reputation . 
&quot; We experimented by promoting Shahid Afridi to open the innings with Saeed Anwar but it did not work . 
we might resort to the tried and trusted combination of Aamir Sohail and Anwar on Sunday . 
new Zealand coach Steve Rixon said team morale was high after their victory over Sri Lanka in the opening match of the tournament . 
Sri Lanka spinner Kumara Dharmasena , who injured his right shoulder while attempting a diving catch on Friday , may be forced to miss his side &apos;s next match . 
&quot; The X-ray has shown he has no dislocation and there is no fracture . 
at the most he may miss one match , &quot; said manager Duleep Mendis .
