South Korea &apos;s real gross domestic product is forecast to grow by 6.6 percent this year , the Korea Institute of Finance said on Monday in predicting slower growth than forecast by the government . 
the government &apos;s revised economic forecast is for 7.0 percent growth after inflation . 
an institute statement said GDP growth would slow to 5.9 percent in the third quarter of this year , hit by worsening international trade and a slowdown in facilities investment by domestic companies . 
the growth is expected to rebound to 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter , it said . 
the statement said the South Korean economy would show a slight improvement from the third quarter of next year in line with a steady rise in the global economy . 
but the GDP growth would slow to 6.3 percent for the whole of 1997 , it said . 
the institute forecast the dollar / won exchange rate would average 820.7 won next year against a projected 800.1 won this year . 
the institute projected that in 1996 , South Korea &apos;s current account deficit would be $ 19.38 billion , up from a $ 8.95 billion shortfall a year earlier . 
the deficit is expected to narrow to $ 16.67 billion next year . 
the statement said exports on a free-on-board basis would total $ 131.72 billion in 1996 , while imports on a cost , insurance and freight basis would amount to $ 146.32 billion , resulting in a trade deficit of $ 11.47 billion . 
it said the consumer price index would rise 4.9 percent for the year , while the government has targetted 4.5 percent . 
the unemployment rate was seen rising to 2.7 percent from 2.0 percent on average . 
many South Korean companies , suffering from worsening profitability following slowing exports , planned to freeze spending on wages and benefits and to introduce an &quot; early retirement &quot; scheme to fight low-efficiency and high costs .
