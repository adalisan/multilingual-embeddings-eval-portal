China on Thursday promised to invite representatives from arch-rival Taiwan to attend ceremonies marking the return of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 . 
Taiwan residents invited to witness the end of London &apos;s 156 years of colonial reign in Hong Kong would have to approve of the territory &apos;s return to Beijing and accept that Taiwan was part of China , said Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang . 
&quot; We will invite Taiwan people to attend , &quot; Shen told a news briefing . 
&quot; But they must conform to the principle of &apos; One China &apos; , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Those invited must uphold China &apos;s resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong . 
Communist-ruled China has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since 1949 , when defeated Nationalist forces took refuge on the island at the end of a long civil war . 
Beijing , which reserves the right to invade Taiwan if it ever declares formal independence , has repeatedly demanded the island &apos;s leaders accept the principle of &quot; One China &quot; and prove their intention to eventually reunify with the mainland . 
while Taipei &apos;s Nationalist government is publicly committed to reunification , Beijing accuses it of secretly favouring succession and has broken off official talks aimed at improving relations across the narrow Taiwan Strait . 
spokesman Shen said the guest list for the glitzy Hong Kong handover ceremony on June 30 had been basically decided , but gave no details of who was likely to be invited from Taiwan . 
an official of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing declined to comment on who would represent Taiwan or how they would be invited . 
&quot; This is currently a secret , &quot; the official said .
