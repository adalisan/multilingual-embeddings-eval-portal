two of the towering figures of the 20th century , Pope John Paul and Fidel Castro , are to meet for the first time on Tuesday in an encounter that will almost certainly lead to a papal trip to communist Cuba . 
it will be the highest-profile papal audience since December 1 , 1989 when the Polish-born Pope received then Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev as the Iron Curtain began to disintegrate . 
ironically , exactly 24 hours before his scheduled meeting with Castro , the Pope met for the fourth time with Gorbachev , whose &quot; perestroika &quot; restructuring reforms began the domino effect that led to the end of communism in Eastern Europe . 
&quot; Your Holiness , I recall our first meeting here which led to the start of so many changes both inside and outside of the Soviet Union , &quot; Gorbachev said , according to a spokesman . 
the restrictions on the Roman Catholic Church in Cuba now are similar , if not identical , to those in place in the Soviet Union and parts of eastern Europe until the fall of the Berlin Wall . 
at 11 a.m. ( 1000 GMT ) on Tuesday Castro , one of the world &apos;s few remaining Marxist leaders , will walk into the frescoed private study of a Pope whose personal crusades encouraged the peoples of eastern Europe to shake off communism . 
nothing has prepared Castro , who was schooled by the Jesuits before he became an atheist , for the splendours of the Vatican palaces . 
nothing except perhaps the Kremlin , where Castro was a regular visitor until Moscow shut off the aid tap to Cuba . 
the 70-year-old veteran revolutionary and icon of the international left will almost certainly ask the Pope , 76 , to speak out even more forcefully than he has already against the 34-year-old U.S. embargo on his Caribbean island nation . 
Castro is expected to defend his social achievements , such as education and health care , on the island which is still about 42 percent Catholic . 
Vatican sources said the Pope was expected to call on Castro to introduce democratic political reforms . 
the Pontiff is also expected to ask Castro to allow the Catholic Church in Cuba to enjoy more educational and religious freedom and to have more access to the media , the sources added . 
shortly after Castro took control in 1959 , Cuba was officially declared a socialist state . 
some 350 Catholic schools were nationalised and more than 100 priests expelled . 
freedom of worship and religious instruction in Cuba , the only Spanish-speaking country in Latin America the Pope has not visited , are limited to church premises . 
the local church , which the Pope rewarded for the hardships it has suffered by naming its first cardinal in 1994 , has often clashed with what it calls the government &apos;s atheistic philosophy . 
an historic papal trip to Cuba , for years seemingly impossible , now looks to be almost a certainty . 
Castro , answering reporters &apos; questions on Sunday at the close of a U.N.-sponsored World Food Summit in Rome , suggested that the Pope could come at any time he wanted . 
he said the Pope has travelled at all times of the year , and any season would be good for a papal trip to Cuba . 
some Italian intellectuals had urged the Pope to shun Castro to draw attention to what they called human rights abuses . 
but the Vatican &apos;s policy is to grant a papal audience to any head of state who requests it . 
that policy , as some visitors to the frescoed study have discovered , does not rule out a lecture . 
Castro told reporters that he planned to take a &quot; message of peace &quot; to the Pope , but added : &quot; I &apos;m not going to get into theological issues at all . 
he added , though , that the world was no longer a spacious Garden of Eden and that artificial birth control , divorce and abortion -- all opposed by the Vatican -- were perhaps necessary evils on an overcrowded planet .
