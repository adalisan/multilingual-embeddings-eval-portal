the Asian debt markets limped to a quiet close on Friday , after a subdued week , marked by holidays in major markets and currency concerns in Thailand . 
more terms have emerged on the Perwaja Terenggamu SDN Bhd S $ 400 million five-year floating-rate note through Standard Chartered Bank . 
the FRCDs are issued at par to float at 22 basis points over the London Interbank offered Rate ( Libor ) , and there are no puts and calls . 
the issue is guaranteed by the Malaysian government , hence the tight pricing . 
in other news , Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp has launched a US $ 50 million one-year term loan through coordinating arranger Societe Generale Asia . 
handover euphoria may help the Bank of China &apos;s HK $ 2 billion floating-rate certificate of deposit ( FRCD ) issue , launched in late June , before the June 30 handover to China . 
bankers said they had heard the deal had been 2.5 times subscribed . 
they said the Bank of China might increase it to HK $ 5 billion , stamping its mark on the Hong Kong dollar market , which was closed for the first three days of the week to mark the handover . 
bankers said the paper was reasonably priced and a chance to build relationships with Boc in the new post-colonial Hong Kong . 
Hong Kong &apos;s regal Hotels International Holdings Ltd is expected to join the ranks of myriad Hong Kong corporates taking advantage of a borrower &apos;s market . 
bankers said they expected it to raise HK $ 4.6 billion through a term loan facility , launched through a special-purpose company backed by regal Hotels International . 
the seven-year deal has a put option in year five . 
the loan is mainly denominated in Hong Kong dollars but part of it is available in U.S. dollars at lenders &apos; option . 
it pays a margin of 125 basis points over the Hong Kong Interbank offered Rate or 120 basis points over the London Interbank offered Rate . 
bankers are still trying to re-assess Thai banks and corporates to work out their foreign currency exposures now that the baht peg had been snapped . 
one said reaction to sovereign Thai debt had been positive , with a Kingdom of Thailand Yankee coming in about seven basis points to 102 basis points over the underlying treasuries . 
but the jury is still out on Thai banks , which have been borrowing U.S. dollars and on-lending to clients . 
however , one banker said there was still money to be made from good quality Thai convertible bonds , issued in U.S. dollars , but redeemable in baht at the old rate when the baht was linked to the U.S. dollar .
