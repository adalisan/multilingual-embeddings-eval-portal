running out of patience with a wave of violence that has swept the countryside , the Brazilian government on Tuesday announced it would take steps to disarm battling landowners and militant squatters . 
in his weekly radio address to the nation , President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said it was time those who broke the law were punished and a stream of deaths in clashes between the hired guns of estate owners and the dispossessed came to an end . 
&quot; People and known groups have gone beyond the norms of behaviour that must be respected , killing and causing trouble in several parts of Brazil , &quot; Cardoso said . 
justice Minister Nelson Jobim , speaking on the same radio broadcast , said he would start touring the worst troublespots later this month with orders for local justice authorities to arrest lawbreakers and confiscate illegal weapons . 
&quot; Our mission is to re-establish order in the countryside , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I appeal to the good sense of the representatives of the landless movement and the rural employers to obey the law and abide by the Brazilian peoples &apos; desire for peace and order . 
so far this year , at least five people have died in fighting between landless peasants and farmhands . 
the Catholic Church says Brazil has one of the world &apos;s worst rates of land distribution , with 46 percent of arable land in the hands of just 1 percent of landowners . 
frustration at slow advances on government promises of agrarian reform have led the militant landless Movement ( MST ) , which claims to represent nearly 5 million families , to organise mass occupations of farms . 
dozens of people have died as a result over the past two years , with the worst incident occurring in the northern state of Para last April when military police killed 19 landless squatters blocking a road .
