Taiwan has granted permanent residency to Chinese dissident Wuerkaixi , who shot to fame in Beijing &apos;s 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests and fled into exile after they were crushed . 
&quot; The mainland Affairs Council has agreed to let Wuerkaixi stay in Taiwan permanently , &quot; an official of the cabinet &apos;s top China policymaking body told Reuters by telephone . 
the official said Wuerkaixi was not the first mainland dissident granted Taiwan residency , but he would not name others . 
the United Evening News said Wuerkaixi &apos;s case had been approved because Taiwan recognised his &quot; outstanding achievement in leading the pro-democracy movement &quot; and because he may face unspecified imminent danger . 
the government has maintained a low-profile in handling Wuerkaixi &apos;s application to avoid further angering Beijing , which has viewed the island as a renegade province since a civil war spilt them in 1949 , the newspaper said . 
as a student , Wuerkaixi was one of the most outspoken leaders of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement that swept China in May and June of 1989 . 
the ethnic Uighur student from China &apos;s far western Xinjiang province sprang to fame in May 1989 when he argued with Chinese Premier Li Peng in a televised meeting with student leaders who were demanding greater democracy in China . 
after China &apos;s army crushed the demonstrations on June 3-4 , 1989 , with the death of hundreds , Wuerkaixi fled into exile and was granted political asylum in the United States . 
he married a Taiwanese woman in August 1994 and recently has been hosting a television interview show .
