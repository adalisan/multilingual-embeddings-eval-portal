shares were seen opening higher after the Dow industrials posted their second biggest one-day gain ever , but the rise here was expected to be less spectacular , brokers said . 
&quot; Expectations are positive ... Hopefully we &apos;ll rise more than one percent , &quot; one broker said , but added : &quot; I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll rise as fast ( as Wall St ) because the decline here was less steep , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think we could rise by one percent to one and a half percent , &quot; another broker predicted . 
the strong dollar was seen boosting cyclicals and Nokia . 
Nokia alone , which closed in New York on Tuesday at about 305.60 markka , or 5.60 markka above its Helsinki close , would probably help the index higher , brokers said .
