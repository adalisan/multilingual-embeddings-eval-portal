Cahners publishing Co , the U.S. publishing unit of Reed Elsevier , expects to post a 15 percent gain in operating income in 1998 , Cahners chief executive Bruce Barnet said Wednesday . 
in an interview with Reuters , Barnet said the publishing company would post revenue gains of about 7-9 percent this year and in 1998 . 
on Monday , Reed Elsevier announced it was buying Chilton publishing Group from Walt Disney Co for $ 447 million . 
Barnet said the percentage gain in operating income would be significantly higher this year due to the acquisition . 
the company said Chilton recorded 1996 EBITDA -- earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization -- of about $ 28 million on revenues of about $ 203 million . 
he would not disclose Cahner &apos;s total revenues or operating income , and Reed Elsevier does not separately disclose those results . 
Barnet didn &apos;t dispute industry estimates of Cahners annual revenues ranging from $ 600 million to $ 1 billion . 
Barnet said Cahners would continue to seek acquisitions , but he declined to elaborate . 
earlier this year , Reed Elsevier bought the law publishing business of Thomson Corp. 
Barnet said that while revenues in the overall category of electronic publishing are currently small , they should grow to five to 10 percent of revenues within the next three years , then more rapidly afterwards . 
Barnet said the current U.S. advertising market for trade magazines was strong due to a robust economy . 
Cahners 
publishes 92 trade and professional magazines in such areas as entertainment and manufacturing . 
Chilton publishes 39 trade magazines as well as automotive books . 
in the wake of the Chilton purchase , Reed Elsevier will change Cahners &apos;s name to Reed Elsevier Business Information within the next two months .
