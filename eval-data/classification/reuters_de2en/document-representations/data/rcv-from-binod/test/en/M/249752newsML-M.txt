India &apos;s sluggish stock markets ended a three-week slide on Wednesday after Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda promised to review a controversial new corporate tax , brokers said . 
the 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ) -- which had tumbled 33 percent in recent months from a June peak -- leapt 142.86 points , or 5.10 percent , to close at a provisional 2,941.43 . 
&quot; The prime minister &apos;s remarks and institutional buying lifted the market , &quot; said Ketan Jhaveri , chief dealer at Kotak Securities . 
&quot; Foreign buy orders poured in . 
&quot; He said the rebound was boosted by hectic short-covering , but that the sharp rise could prove the market &apos;s undoing . 
&quot; If the market hadn &apos;t moved so abruptly we could have hoped for a sustained turnaround , &quot; he said . 
on Tuesday , DEVE Gowda told industrialists in New Delhi he would review the recently introduced minimum alternate tax ( MAT ) , which the industrialists had told him was the reason behind slowing industrial growth and corporate profits . 
&quot; About your point on taxation , we have taken note and will consider it when next year &apos;s budget is being formulated , &quot; the prime minister had said . 
India &apos;s budget for fiscal 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) is normally presented to parliament in late February . 
the MAT , imposed in July , hit companies that had previously avoided paying tax by investing in tax-exempt expansions and diversifications . 
&quot; psychologically , it &apos;s a big morale booster , &quot; said Bharat Iyer , market strategist at UBS Securities , the investment arm of Union Bank of Switzerland , referring to the prime minister &apos;s statement . 
&quot; It is very positive . 
analysts said the market had been waiting for some good news after prices had slumped on a string of poor first-half company results , slowing industrial production and rising fuel and energy costs . 
though the economy has slowed down , economists don &apos;t foresee a recession . 
&quot; We feel that a turnaround over the next six months is the most probable of all scenarios , &quot; Sanjeev Mohta , research head at James Capel B &amp; K , said in a note to investors . 
&quot; The most positive development is higher rural incomes which should drive demand growth . 
Iyer of UBS was not convinced the market had bottomed out . 
&quot; In terms of valuations , the market is cheap , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But there &apos;s nothing to conclude the prices won &apos;t get cheaper . 
he said the government would have to make some harsh decisions such as an increase in subsidised petrol and diesel prices probably early next year . 
Kotak &apos;s Jhaveri agreed the fuel price increase was the market &apos;s biggest worry .
