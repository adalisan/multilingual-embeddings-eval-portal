at least 32 people were killed when a bus carrying 40 passengers fell into a river in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh on Thursday , state officials said . 
&quot; Thirty two have been confirmed dead , &quot; a spokesman of the Madhya Pradesh state government said . 
the spokesman said the bus was on its way to Indore in Madhya Pradesh from Amravati in the western state of Maharashtra when it went into the Narmada river near Nemawar , about 220 km ( 140 miles ) west of the state capital Bhopal , he said . 
a police official said two passengers swam to safety and the fate of the others was not known . 
&quot; The bus is still in the river and army divers have been called to retrieve the bodies , &quot; the police official said . 
early this month , at least 27 people died when a bus fell into a swollen river in northern Uttar Pradesh state . 
in another incident , 25 people died after a bus fell into a water-logged ditch in Bihar state . 
monsoon rains from June to September cause havoc with normal life in India , where a poor drainage system fails to cope with the excess water .
