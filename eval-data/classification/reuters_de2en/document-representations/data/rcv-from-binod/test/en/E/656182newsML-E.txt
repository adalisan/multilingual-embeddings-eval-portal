Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan denied a newspaper report published Thursday which said the government was preventing imports from entering the country . 
&quot; There is absolutely no basis for the report that imports ... are being restricted , &quot; Malan said in a statement read out by a spokesman . 
Gazeta Mercantil reported up to $ 2.0 billion worth of imports had been stuck for two months awaiting paperwork from tax officials . 
the newspaper quoted private sector importers who complained of delays in getting their goods through customs . 
it also said officials at the Finance and Industry and Commerce ministries were at loggerheads over who should control import policy . 
Malan &apos;s spokesman acknowledged there had been some delays in goods entering Brazil in recent weeks following a decision to restrict access to the government &apos;s new , computerized Siscomex import system to only three or four civil servants . 
&quot; There could have been some problems , but they have been cleared up , &quot; the spokesman said . 
earlier Thursday , state petroleum giant Petrobras denied a report on national Globo television that it suspended oil imports to help Brazil &apos;s trade balance .
