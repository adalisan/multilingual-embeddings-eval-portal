few would have bet on Piero Liatti to win the Monte Carlo rally but the unfancied Subaru driver took a gamble and on Wednesday became the first Italian to triumph in the gaming capital since Miki Biasion in 1989 . 
brilliant driving on slippery roads and astute but risky choices of tyres were the keys to the 34-year-old Liatti &apos;s success in the winter classic , which opened a season marked by a revolution in formats and rules . 
on several occasions in the four-day race , the Italian , who clocked the best time in half of the rally &apos;s 18 timed stages , fitted his brand new Impreza with dry asphalt tyres when his rivals expected wet terrain . 
&quot; It really paid off because the sun had melted the remaining ice and dried out the wet sections , &quot; said Liatti , who finished 55 seconds ahead of the Ford Escort of Spaniard Carlos Sainz , twice a Monte Carlo winner . 
&quot; To win a rally like this one is just fantastic , &quot; added Liatti , holding his three-month-old son in his arms . 
world champion Tommi Makinen of Finland long looked like winning but he dropped out of contention by losing control of his Mitsubishi Lancer and hitting a snowdrift with three tests remaining and had to be content with third place , two minutes 31 seconds behind Liatti . 
&quot; It was a tough day for us with lots of problems , &quot; said Makinen . 
&quot; Not only did we lose time in the accident but we also had problems with the tyres and the intercooler . 
never mind , the championship is only starting . 
you have to give Liatti credit . 
he had a sensational race . 
Liatti was hired by Subaru to share their second car with Swede Kenneth Eriksson this season but he became their sole chance after team leader Colin McRae crashed out on Tuesday . 
&quot; We turned a bit late on a third gear corner , hit a patch of ice on my side and went off into a snowbank , &quot; explained Briton McRae , who was fourth overall before his accident . 
&quot; We lost a lot of time getting the car out of the snow but we managed to finish the stage , &quot; added the 1995 world champion . 
&quot; But the steering arm was broken and it was impossible to continue . 
we were just plain unlucky . 
Liatti , whose best previous results were three second places , attracted only polite curiosity when the rally started on Sunday , partly because of his female co-driver Fabrizia Pons . 
lying second , 24 seconds behind Makinen , when the final day started , he captured the lead by claiming Wednesday &apos;s crucial first test , the longest of this year &apos;s race over 36.67 kms from Sisteron to Thoard . 
he set the fastest times in four of the last six timed stages . 
he kept pushing until the very last one on the lower part of the Monaco Grand Prix circuit which went to German Armin Schwarz , who ended up fourth overall in his Ford Escort . 
to comply with new formats making rallies shorter , the organisers were forced to drop the traditional night finale in the mountains overlooking the principality . 
the concentration run , which used to see the drivers setting off from several European cities to gather in Monte Carlo for the start , was also scrapped . 
the race marked the introduction of the new , world rally cars ( WRC ) , which have aggressive looks with fat wings and a rear ailerons . 
instead of having to build at least 2,500 units of their racing car , constructors can now work from an existing family saloon and improve it with four-wheel drive and a turbocharger . 
it will take time to measure the effects of this cautious return to purpose-built machines , aimed at attracting more manufacturers by making it cheaper to develop a rally car , as only Subaru and Ford entered WRCs in Monte Carlo . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of work to do on the car still but it sounds promising , &quot; Sainz said of his Ford Escort . 
other constructors are still getting their WRCSs ready , starting with Mitsubishi , who plan to launch their new Carisma in the next race , in February in Sweden . 
there will be 14 rounds this year , compared to nine in 1996 , and constructors fighting for the title will have to enter every one of them .
