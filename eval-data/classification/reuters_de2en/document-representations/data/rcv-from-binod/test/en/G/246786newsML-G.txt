the European Commission adopted on Tuesday its report on the review of Directive 90 / 220 on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) , pointing to various areas of possible change . 
the Commission said the existing directive was not clear enough about the objectives for GMO risk assessment , which could result in &quot; cumbersome procedures for low-risk releases &quot; , the report said . 
it said there was also poor linkage between the directive &apos;s section B on experimental releases and section C on releasing products onto the market . 
that meant that experimental releases did not always provide relevant information for marketing applications . 
cumbersome administrative procedures also led to approval delays , said the document , which was released to reporters . 
these were compounded by the lack of an active Commission role in part C , which meant the executive could not suggest simplified procedures , the report said . 
it also said the absence of an independent dispute-solving body of scientists and of sufficient flexibility for technical adaptation created problems for marketing approvals . 
the directive also made no provision for labelling requirements , it said . 
&quot; It will be essential to address this issue in order to take account of the need to inform consumers and to comply with the international obligations , &quot; the report said . 
the Commission will propose amendments to the directive under the co-decision legislative procedure , the report said .
