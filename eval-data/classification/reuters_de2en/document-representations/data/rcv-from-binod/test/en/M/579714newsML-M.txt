Italian bond futures drifted lower in late afternoon following the trend in treasuries while worries over the 1998 budget and the government &apos;s three-year economy plan undermined investor confidence , dealers said . 
U.S. April retail sales showed a 0.3 percent decline on the month and initially pushed T-bonds higher , but then they eased back which soon led to a weakening in BTPs and bunds . 
dealers said there is some caution over the prospects for the 1998 budget and what measures it will contain , which coupled with fading hopes of a interest rate cut by the Bank of Italy caused the market to look and consolidate at these levels . 
dealers are expecting to see a deficit-cutting budget of around 25 trillion lire but are waiting to see what measures are contained in the package , while the market also awaits details of the government &apos;s three year economic plan ( DPEF ) containing targets for 1998-2000 which is expected around the end of May . 
&quot; What we are seeing is a little bit a caution creeping in and we can expect some consolidation around these levels , &quot; said one LIFFE trader . 
economic data released earlier showing that Italian March PPI posted a year-on-year rise of 0.9 percent against a previous 0.8 percent increase had little market impact . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi met trade union leaders on Tuesday for the first round of talks over controversial welfare reforms , but the heads of Italy &apos;s big three trades union federations told Prodi they would not start full negotiations until the government released its DPEF plan .
