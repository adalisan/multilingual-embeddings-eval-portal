the recent slump in prices for Russian Urals makes the marketing of Iraqi crude in the Mediterranean a trickier task , oil traders said on Thursday . 
when the December price for Iraqi Kirkuk crude of dated Brent - $ 1.55 a barrel was released in late November , refiners said that it looked like an attractive alternative to high-priced Urals . 
but the prospect of a renewed flow of Kirkuk to the Mediterranean market has heavily depressed prices for Urals , the region &apos;s main sour crude marker . 
over the last week , differentials have slid from a traded high of dated Brent -12.5 cents to recent traded levels of dated Brent - $ 1 and - $ 1.05 . 
the extent of the fall should prompt Med refiners to reassess the profitability of the Russian crude relative to Kirkuk , traders said . 
&quot; Kirkuk looked fantastic when Urals was in the minus 30s , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; But Iraqi barrels have already caused a reassessment of sour differentials . 
at least two major Mediterranean refiners are believed to be on the brink of signing crude purchasing contracts with Iraq . 
in addition , several European trading houses and Russian oil firms have already signed deals to lift Iraqi crude cargoes , which they are expected to tout on the Mediterranean spot market . 
&quot; ( European traders ) haven &apos;t lifted anything yet so we &apos;ll have to see what the situation is when they do , &quot; a traders for a Mediterranean refiner said . 
&quot; But of course it &apos;s not going to be as easy to sell ( Iraqi barrels ) as it would have been last week ( when Urals prices were high ) . 
traders said that refiners &apos; familiarity with Iraq crude would allow them to make quick calculations of profitability . 
&quot; Keep in mind that ( before the Gulf War ) Iraqi barrels were very well traded ... both U.S. and Med refiners know its quality and its yield very well , &quot; said one . 
at least three tankers with European destinations are expected to load with Iraqi crude from the Turkish port of Ceyhan before the end of the month , shipping sources said . 
the 142,000 deadweight tonne ( dwt ) Tito Tapias has been chartered by Elf to load on December 21 , and is expected to sail to Lavera in the south of France . 
the sources said that the 142,000 dwt marble had been chartered by Spain &apos;s Repsol to load on December 24 , while another cargo with options into northwest Europe or the Mediterranean is expected to load before the end of the December . 
these vessels will follow the Gole , which was the first ship to load Iraqi oil since the approval of the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal . 
two tankers loaded with Iraqi crude have so far left the northern Gulf export terminal of Mina al-Bakr . 
the first , the Star of Africa , was chartered by U.S. Coastal Corp and left for the Caribbean island of Aruba on Tuesday . 
this was followed the Leonidas , chartered by U.S. independent Bayoil , and also headed transatlantic .
