new Zealand Finance Minister Bill birch said on Thursday that inflation was expected to move back into the middle of the Reserve Bank &apos;s 0-2 percent target band next year , allowing interest rates to fall further . 
birch said in a breakfast speech in Wellington that next month &apos;s Economic and Fiscal Update from the Treasury contained no surprises but included a slight downward revision in tax forecasts . 
this would in turn slightly reduce forecasts for the government &apos;s operating surplus in this and subsequent years , he said . 
birch said the economy was showing &quot; quite remarkable &quot; strength . 
&quot; At the bottom of a business cycle , we have growth well above two percent of GDP . 
birch said the December update would confirm that &quot; export growth is now slowing , but the economy will nonetheless rebound next year , then show solid , sustained levels of growth through to the year 2000 and beyond &quot; . 
he said income-based GDP , which adds up all income , principally wages and profits , earned in the economy during the year , had risen six percent in the 1995-6 year against Treasury expectations of 5.1 percent . 
statistics New Zealand had revised its estimate of nominal expenditure-based GDP over the year to 5.5 percent from 3.9 percent . 
profits rose 5.8 percent in the 1995-96 year against Treasury expectations of just two percent , versus 7.1 percent in 1995-95 . 
&quot; These numbers significantly change the picture we all had until now of what happened in the past year , &quot; birch said . 
&quot; There is more momentum to growth , coming out of 1995-96 , than previously anticipated . 
the cycle will bottom from a higher base .
