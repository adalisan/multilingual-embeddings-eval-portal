the ratio of Italy &apos;s public administration deficit to gross domestic product ( GDP ) may be cut by no more than three percentage points in 1997 unless supplementary deficit-cutting measures are adopted , the Bank of Italy said in a report on Friday . 
Italy &apos;s public administration deficit-to-GDP ratio in 1996 was 6.8 percent . 
the government has set itself a target of cutting the ratio to three percent in 1997 as part of a bid to qualify as a founding member of European economic and monetary union , planned for launch in 1999 . 
&quot; In the absence of further measures , the reduction of the ratio , compared to the 1996 level , may not surpass three percentage points , &quot; the central bank said . 
the government is expected to introduce a supplementary budget in the coming weeks which would attempt to slice a further 15 trillion lire off the 1997 budget deficit .
