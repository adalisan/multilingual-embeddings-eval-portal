Japan &apos;s political parties are revving up their electoral machines for polls expected later this year , but a growing number of legislators want to scrap their parties for new vehicles to get them through the race . 
foremost among the tyre kickers is Yukio Hatoyama , 49-year-old grandson of a 1950s prime minister and an official of Sakigake , the junior member in a three-party coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) and the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) . 
Hatoyama , who boasts an engineering doctorate from Stanford University in California , will need all the design skills he can muster to forge a party from the idealistic reformers of Sakigake and the ideologically fatigued SDP , pundits say . 
the latest round of manoeuvring -- which intensified this week -- involves some of the very same legislators whose 1993 defections from the LDP ended four decades of unbroken rule by that party and put a reformist coalition in power . 
the mavericks &apos; goal in 1993 was reform to undo the side effects of one party-rule -- political corruption , bureaucrats &apos; dominance of policy-making and an absence of policy debate -- projects that still await completion , analysts say . 
the aim this time around , ironically , is for the small parties to survive one of the only major reforms the previous coalition made stick -- a radical overhaul of the electoral system under which they must face voters before next July . 
in 1994 , then-prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa &apos;s coalition government introduced an electoral system in which 300 legislators are elected in first-past-the post , single-seat districts and 200 others by proportional representation . 
the new system replaced one in which 129 districts sent between two and six legislators to parliament . 
the multi-seat districts , in which a legislator could win a seat by finishing in fifth place with about 10,000 votes from a narrow interest group , were thought to foster pork barrel politics and corruption . 
the old system , however , was friendly to smaller parties , which lack the personnel and resources to win one-on-one contests against the well-oiled and deeply entrenched LDP and Shinshinto , the main opposition party . 
the parties expected to face the toughest battle in the next electoral contest are Sakigake and the SDP . 
Sakigake , with only 23 seats in parliament , is too tiny to take on the big parties , while the larger SDP suffers an identity crisis after dropping its traditional leftist defence and foreign policies without coming up with new ones . 
policy issues have taken a back seat to public disputes over personnel and timing questions in Hatoyama &apos;s group , prompting scepticism about whether it can recapture the reform spirit of 1993 that the LDP &apos;s re-emergence has all but stymied . 
&quot; It was only three years ago , but it &apos;s almost like 30 years ago , &quot; said policy analyst Kenichi Ohmae . 
&quot; I think it ( a chance for reform ) will come back again , but the biorhythm today is very low . 
you have to wait for the next wave . 
Hashimoto must call polls by mid-1997 , and has repeatedly said he would not consider calling an early general election . 
but many analysts and politicians believe he may dissolve parliament soon after it reconvenes in early October . 
no date has been set for the opening of parliament .
