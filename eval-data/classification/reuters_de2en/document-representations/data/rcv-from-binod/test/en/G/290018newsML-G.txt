renegade Sri Lankan priest Tissa Balasuriya has been excommunicated for challenging fundamental beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church , the Vatican said . 
cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , said in an official statement dated Saturday that the penalty was incurred over a &quot; a series of grave errors &quot; in the cleric &apos;s vision which distorted Catholic dogma . 
Balasuriya refused to retract claims made in his book &quot; Mary and Human Liberation &quot; , published by his Centre for Society and Religion , in which he questioned fundamental Catholic beliefs like baptism , original sin and the immaculate conception . 
&quot; Father Balasuriya has deviated from the integrity of the truth of the Catholic faith and therefore cannot be considered a Catholic theologian , &quot; Ratzinger &apos;s statement said . 
&quot; Moreover , he has incurred excommunication latae sententiae , &quot; he added in the statement , dated Saturday . 
excommunication -- which forbids excommunicates to receive the sacraments or share in acts of public worship -- is usually imposed &quot; ferendae sententiae &quot; , that is after a formal &quot; trial &quot; . 
however seven offences , including heresy , schism , laying violent hands on the Pope and procuring abortion , are considered so disruptive of ecclesiastical life that they trigger automatic excommunication &quot; latae sententiae &quot; . 
it is very rare . 
father Balasuriya told Reuters in Colombo he could not comment until he was officially notified . 
Church officials said they believed it was the first time a Sri Lankan priest had been excommunicated . 
the Roman Catholic Church first denounced Balasuriya &apos;s book in 1994 and ordered him to stop reading from it . 
he refused . 
Balasuriya last month refused to sign a profession of Faith , especially drafted for him by the Church , saying it was not in line with current theological thinking and that his conscience would not allow him to sign . 
he appealed directly to Pope John Paul , saying his text was within the limits of orthodoxy . 
the appeal for a stay of excommunication fell on deaf ears after the Vatican said Balasuriya refused to adhere to the faith of the Church .
