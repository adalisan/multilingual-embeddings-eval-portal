a New Jersey transportation official said Tuesday the state has not yet decided whether a $ 200 million cash windfall will translate into more bonding in fiscal 1998 by the Transportation Trust Fund Authority . 
David Brown , a spokesman for Department of Transportation , said in a telephone interview that officials are still considering whether the extra spending planned for the fiscal year beginning July 1 will require more bonds . 
in an earlier interview , Brown said the state did not expect more bonding to result . 
the trust fund normally spends about $ 700 million annually , but in fiscal 1998 the figure will jump to $ 900 million , boosted by unexpectedly low debt service payments on outstanding debt . 
&quot; We &apos;ve not decided where the $ 200 million will break down between cash and bonds , &quot; Brown said . 
&quot; That &apos;s being decided right now .
