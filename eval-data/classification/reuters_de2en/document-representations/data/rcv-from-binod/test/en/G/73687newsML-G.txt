Algeria &apos;s main opposition parties have rejected President Liamine Zeroual &apos;s proposal to join in the government while the former ruling National Liberation Front ( FLN ) still has to decide whether to enter the cabinet . 
Zeroual on Saturday invited all legal opposition parties into his government with the aim of &quot; associating all political partners in the country &apos;s management . 
the main secular opposition Socialist Forces Front ( FFS ) said on Tuesday it had rejected the proposal because it disagreed with Zeroual &apos;s whole approach to settle the country &apos;s crisis , which has seen nearly five years of conflict between security forces and Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas . 
&quot; The FFS wants to give no support for a move which is not seeking a real solution to end the crisis . 
we had demanded that a neutral government to be set up when an accord was reached on a solution . 
it is not the case now . 
we reject the proposal , &quot; said FFS spokesman , Ali Rachedi , speaking by telephone from Algeria . 
the FFS earlier walked out of talks with Zeroual and it stayed away from a national conference which ended 10 days ago with a pact being signed by 38 party , union and other organisation leaders . 
the pact , most of whose signatories were seen as having little popular support , lends support for Zeroual &apos;s plans to hold a referendum to amend the constitution this year followed by general elections in 1997 . 
the legal Islamist Nahda party , whose leader Abdallah Djaballah signed the pact , has also decided against taking part in the government . 
&quot; We rejected the idea of entering the government because the authorities linked this also to joining the Transitional National Council , &quot; said a Nahda spokesman speaking by telephone from the party headquarters in Algiers . 
the Council was appointed by the authorities in 1994 to overlook legislation in the absence of a parliament , dissolved at the start of Algeria &apos;s crisis in January 1992 when the authorities scrapped a general election dominated by the radical Islamist Salvation Front ( FIS ) . 
the Nahda spokesman said : &quot; We see the government as legitimate as it draws its power from Zeroual who was elected last year . 
but the Council was appointed to replace a parliament . 
the other secular parties , Rally for Democracy and Culture ( RCD ) and Ettahadi , said Zeroual &apos;s plan to &quot; reinvigorate &quot; his government did not interest them . 
the two groups boycotted the September conference over a row on secularist demands . 
while two main parties , the legal Islamist Hamas party and Algerian Renewal Party ( PRA ) which signed the pact , are represented in the current cabinet , the FLN said it had taken no final decision on joining the government . 
&quot; The FLN &apos;s decision will be known on October 4 or October 5 after the party has convened its ( policy-making ) central committee , &quot; said FLN &apos;s spokesman Mounir Alimi . 
he dismissed an Algerian newspaper report on Tuesday that the FLN , which ruled Algeria from 1962 to 1991 , was seeking more than three portfolios and more than five seats in the Transitional National Council .
