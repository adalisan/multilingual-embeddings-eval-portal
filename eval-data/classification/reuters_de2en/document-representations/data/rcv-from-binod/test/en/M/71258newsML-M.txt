sugar - World market for September 20 - White sugar futures in London ended lower in quiet dealings . 
December finished at $ 328.50 per tonne , down $ 3.10 , while March lost $ 3.00 to close at $ 338.60 . 
raw sugar futures in New York ended a volatile session lower in technically- driven speculative liquidation . 
traders said open interest remains high and speculators could have more positions to liquidate . 
apparently speculators have realized that no shortage is likely to develop given predictions of another surplus in 1996 / 97 . 
USDA - According to the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) world sugar production in 1996 / 97 could reach 121.4 million tonnes while consumption was put at 119.5 million tonnes . 
however , USDA said the apparent surplus of 1.9 million tonnes disappears after adjustments for unrecorded trade . 
the world production figure is up 1.2 million tonnes from the earlier forecast published in the June Situation and Outlook summary , and 1.5 million tonnes below the revised estimate for 1995 / 96 . 
us imports in 1996 / 97 should be 2.74 million tonnes , USDA said , making the United States the second top importer and at the highest level since 1983 / 84 . 
the Department recently set the sugar import quota for the 1997 fiscal year ( October 1996 / September 1997 ) at 2.3 million tonnes , with 1.7 million tonnes to be allocated immediately and the rest hinging on reviews set for January , March and May 1997 . 
the higher US import quota is expected to reduce western hemisphere raws availability and balance the expected increase in production .
