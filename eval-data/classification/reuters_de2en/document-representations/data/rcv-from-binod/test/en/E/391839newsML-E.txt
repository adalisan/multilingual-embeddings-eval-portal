a strong rise in British broad money growth and a surge in mortgage lending in January point to buoyant domestically-led growth despite the pressure from the relatively strong pound on manufacturing , economists said on Thursday . 
a leading business lobby , the Confederation of British Industry , said manufacturers were struggling to cope with the pound &apos;s recent advance against other European currencies . 
the CBI revised down its forecast for economic growth this year to 2.8 percent from a previous 3.1 percent . 
but economists were more impresed with hard data . 
the Bank of England said M4 money supply -- which measures notes and coins in circulation and bank and building society deposits -- grew by 9.8 percent in the year to January , a bold step up from December &apos;s 9.4 percent rise . 
in the housing market , the British Bankers &apos; Association said mortgage lending surged to 771 million sterling in January compared to 643 million a month earlier -- the largest monthly rise since the market &apos;s recovery began roughly a year ago . 
&quot; It is the personal lending figures that catch the eye this month , particularly that for the major banks &apos; mortgage business , &quot; Tim Sweeney , BBA &apos;s director general said . 
both money supply and mortgage data points to strong consumer demand and defies expectations that Britain &apos;s economy would slow considerably early in 1997 after the sprint ahead late last year . 
economists also said that it should fuel doubts about the government &apos;s refusal to raise interest rates to counter inflationary pressures . 
the government has argued that the strong pound is keeping inflation in check by making imported goods cheaper . 
the CBI also said there was no need to raise base rates from six percent until the third quarter , arguing this would boost the pound even further . 
&quot; While the overall economic outlook remains healthy , there is a less robust projection for the manufacturing sector as exports and profits growth come under pressure , &quot; CBI chief economist Kate Barker said . 
Barker is also one of Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke &apos;s independent advisors . 
so far , he has ignored Bank of England Governor Eddie George &apos;s calls for higher rates to extinguish inflation before it gets going . 
but there is little doubt that consumer spending continues apace . 
the growth in M4 -- an indicator which accurately predicted an upturn in inflation in the 1980s -- was much stronger than had been forecast , even stripping out distorting factors such as a sharp fall in December . 
&quot; With six month annualised M4 growth at 11.0 percent , this is inconsistent in the long term with the Chancellor &apos;s 2.5 percent inflation target , &quot; said Marian Bell , economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in London . 
nonetheless , with elections due by May , many economists believe Clarke is on course to avoid a rate rise . 
&quot; underlying growth in broad money remains strong , while both the housing and non-housing components of personal lending growth show no sign of slowing -- all of which lend additional support for the Bank of England &apos;s view of the world , &quot; said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy . 
&quot; Alas for Eddie George , the Chancellor is in no mood to agree with him . 
in a separate mortgage lending release , the Building Societies Association said new approvals for mortgages fell slightly in January to 3,343 million stg . 
but it said the housing market continues to improve . 
Andrew Milligan , economist at General Accident , said the underlying trend money growth data showed stronger demand from the private sector . 
he agreed the risk of higher interest rates before the election was limited , but said there would probably be a need for a half-point base rate rise afterwards .
