Ecuador &apos;s deposed President Abdala Bucaram handed Venezuela &apos;s leader Rafael Caldera on Friday documents he said proved that he fell victim to a military-backed coup two months ago . 
Bucaram , living in exile in Panama , called on Latin American leaders to help him return to office , saying his ouster on grounds of &quot; mental incompetence &quot; was a disguised coup . 
&quot; I handed President Caldera a document detailing plans for the coup staged in Ecuador and backed by General Paco Moncayo , &quot; Bucaram told reporters at Miraflores presidential palace . 
he accused Ecuador &apos;s armed forces chief Gen. Paco Moncayo of being a warmonger and the real power behind interim President Fabian Alarcon . 
Ecuador &apos;s armed forces last month declared him &quot; persona non grata &quot; and sought a lawsuit against him for slander . 
Bucaram , in Caracas to attend a political forum , said the documents , including taped telephone conversations , also showed that former presidential candidate Jaime Nebot -- whom he beat for the presidency last year -- and Interior Minister Cesar Verduga &quot; planned the repression &quot; to topple him . 
the eccentric leader , whose six-month rule ended in a wave of popular protest and strikes , vowed to contest presidential elections next year when Alarcon &apos;s interim presidency ends .
