Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who said for months he would meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat only if absolutely necessary , said in an interview published on Saturday that he now respected the man . 
after taking office in June , Netanyahu waited 10 weeks before meeting Arafat for the first time on September 4 . 
they met again at the Middle East summit in Washington this month . 
&quot; Arafat was a former enemy and as a human being I have feelings like anyone else but I spoke to him with respect ( in September ) . 
I respect Arafat and there was mutual respect between us , &quot; Netanyahu told orbit , an Arab television station . 
the text of the interview was published in the Egyptian government newspaper Akhbar el-Yom . 
Netanyahu , under hostile questioning from the interviewer , acknowledged that he had an image problem in the Arab world . 
but part of the effort we are making now is to overcome this image and move on to the facts , &quot; the prime minister said . 
pressed on what kind of future Palestinians could expect from negotiations with his government , Netanyahu offered them what appeared to a limited version of local autonomy . 
&quot; We can reach arrangements which guarantee Palestinians complete freedom to run their lives ... We want to let them run their institutions , their schools and their affairs , bring up their children and raise the coming generations , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What we want to do is preserve our security and the life of Israel ... There must be a balance between the Palestinians &apos; need for freedom and our need for security , &quot; he added .
