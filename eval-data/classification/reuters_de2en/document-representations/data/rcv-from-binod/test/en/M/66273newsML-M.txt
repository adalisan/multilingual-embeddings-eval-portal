the gathering of Federal Reserve policy makers in Washington on Tuesday will highlight the coming week for the U.S. Treasury market . 
the meeting &apos;s outcome remains in doubt . 
nearly everyone says the Fed &apos;s decision to raise or not raise rates could tip either way , although a slim majority of analysts polled by Reuters expect the Fed to raise rates by 25 basis points . 
meanwhile , economic data due next week are generally of less interest to investors than data on retail sales , inflation and employment that have recently drawn attention . 
&quot; The highlight of the week will be the FOMC ( Federal Open Market Committee ) , &quot; said Waldo Best , senior economist at BZW Securities . 
&quot; There &apos;s no other important data on the calendar . 
August Federal budget figures come out on Monday . 
economists polled by Reuters expect to see a $ 34.8 billion deficit , versus a $ 27.1 billion deficit report in July . 
the Conference Board &apos;s September consumer confidence index , due at 1000 EDT / 1400 GMT on Tuesday , is expected to read 107.0 , off a bit from the August reading of 109.4 . 
economists polled by Reuters estimated , on average , that those transactions occurred at an annualized 4.09 million rate last month , versus 4.14 million in July . 
jobless claims for the week ended September 21 , due at 0830 EDT / 1230 GMT on Thursday , are forecast at 328,000 , barely changed from 329,000 new claims for state unemployment insurance filed the week before . 
&quot; For me , jobless claims are always a highlight because if the jobless claims numbers stay here , in this range , the mystery grows deeper about what &apos;s going on in the economy , &quot; said James Glassman , senior economist at Chase Securities Inc . 
&quot; To people who look at all the indicators of final demand , the spending side of the economy looks flattish , &quot; said Glassman . 
&quot; Yet the production side of the economy is booming . 
&quot; The manufacturing component of industrial production is up sharply and this is either happening because the numbers on demand are just volatile and underlying demand is doing fine or because businesses are trying to restock depleted inventories , &quot; Glassman said . 
&quot; Job growth , wage growth and jobless claims data all signal that the economy has a lot of momentum . 
August durable goods orders data are also due on Thursday . 
economists polled by Reuters estimated , on average , that orders edged down 0.1 percent in August after jumping 1.7 percent in July . 
without defense-related items , orders are expected to be down 0.7 percent after rising 3.6 percent in July , they said . 
the Conference Board &apos;s August Help-Wanted Advertising Index , due Friday , is forecast at 84.75 , up from 83 in July . 
Monday is expected to be a very quiet day , analysts said . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll see any trades on Monday , &quot; said Best . 
&quot; It &apos;s a High Holy Day , &quot; he said , referring to the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday . 
the market on Monday will be preoccupied with what elements of the economy will prove most persuasive to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and the other central bank policymakers . 
according to Reuters latest poll , seventeen of 30 economists said the Fed is likely to raise interest rates at its September 24 Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) policy meeting . 
all but one of those seventeen expect the rate hike to be 25 basis points . 
economists who say the Fed will weigh in with an interest-rate hike argue that the central bank will be swayed by evidence of wage pressures in the August employment report and the decline in new claims for unemployment insurance . 
those who say the Fed will keep rates steady point to tepid retail sales in June , July , August and early September . 
and they note monthly core inflation data has consistently been benign . 
TIM McGee , senior U.S. economist at Tokai Bank Ltd . , said there is &quot; enough support among the governors &quot; to support the rate hike already favored by many Fed bank districts . 
brokers indicated that Federal funds would open between 5-1 / 4 percent and 5-3 / 8 percent on Monday .
