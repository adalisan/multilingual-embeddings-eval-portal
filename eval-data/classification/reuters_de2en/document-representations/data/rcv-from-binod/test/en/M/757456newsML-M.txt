U.S. West Coast light crude prices edged up Friday in line with broader market gains but trading was minimal due to end-of-month pipeline scheduling . 
&quot; Not only is there scheduling and people are finished for August but it is way too early to be thinking about September , &quot; said a refinery crude trader . 
regional benchmark Alaska North Slope ( ANS ) crude , which last traded in the West Coast market in mid-June at $ 2.16 under benchmark West Texas Intermediate / Cushing , didn &apos;t trade on Friday . 
August WTI was hardly changed on the day at $ 19.68 / 73 , down a cent from the previous day , while September was up around 25 cents at $ 19.91 / 96 . 
traders said dominant ANS seller BP Oil was still trying to get $ 1.85 under for the crude , but buyers were bidding $ 2.50 or more under , and there is plenty of alternative supply available . 
&quot; There are now four refiners running ( Ecadorean ) Oriente and by the end of August there will be five running ( Mexican ) Maya , &quot; said one trader . 
meanwhile , Arco Pipeline Co plans to announce its apportionment Monday for Line 63 , the major pipeline between California &apos;s San Joaquin Valley ( SJV ) oil fields and Los Angeles refineries .
