the governor , who accelerated payments due in March to December 23 for 44 cities , also pledged to push for a reform that will aid municipalities , which have objected to the state requiring them to pay for programs that it does not fund . 
&quot; I will continue to push for significant mandate relief and other initiatives that will help lower the burden on our local governments and their taxpayers , &quot; Pataki said , in prepared remarks . 
new York City will get a one-time accelerated payment of $ 54 million , in addition to the $ 59 million that it gets each month . 
and 43 upstate cities will get payments totaling $ 54 million .
