CBOT November soybean futures closed higher on another day of strong stopping of deliveries posted against that month , traders said . 
&quot; There was no farmer selling and ADM stopped the beans , &quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds . 
the ADM investor Services house account stopped 740,000 bushels of the 745,000 posted Friday for delivery on the November contract . 
Friday was the third consecutive session ADM surfaced as a strong commercial stopper of the soybean deliveries . 
traders said short covering boosted the market . 
position squaring was noted before the release late Friday of the commodity futures Trading Commission Commitments of Traders Report . 
also the market was evening-up for the weekend amid positioning before the release Tuesday of USDA &apos;s November crop production report . 
the Leslie-ADM elevator survey released early Friday showed 1996 U.S. soybean production at 2.38 billion bushels , above an average analysts &apos; estimate of 2.376 billion . 
soybeans closed 1-1 / 4 cents per bushel higher to 3-1 / 4 lower , with November up 1-1 / 4 at $ 6.87-3 / 4 . 
traders said the soybean market found significant underpinning from the gains in corn and wheat . 
&quot; Commercial buying in wheat and corn kept the market up all day , &quot; said Mark Cermak of O &apos;Connor and Co . 
he also said , &quot; There &apos;s a lot of talk ADM may make the play ( delivery ) good , &quot; referring to trade speculation that ADM may not redeliver the beans it stopped this week . 
soybean futures volume was estimated at 48,000 contracts , below the 51,470 traded Thursday , according to the CBOT .
