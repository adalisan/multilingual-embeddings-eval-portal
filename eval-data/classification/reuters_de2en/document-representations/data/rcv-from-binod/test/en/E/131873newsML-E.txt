Australian Assistant Treasurer Rod Kemp said on Monday the government expected strong economic growth to continue in 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; We expect solid growth to continue this year and are forecasting real GDP ( gross domestic product ) growth of around 3.5 percent , &quot; Kemp told a Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia conference . 
the forecast is line with the government &apos;s 1996 / 97 budget prediction . 
Kemp also said Australia &apos;s current account deficit remained a problem . 
&quot; It is wrong to conclude that the current account problem is over , &quot; he said . 
Kemp said the main challenges facing the government were to boost national savings and reduce the current account deficit , which stood at A $ 1.330 billion , seasonally adjusted , in August . 
&quot; It has been argued by some that the recent decline in the current account deficit - which has been significant - means that it is under control , &quot; he said . 
&quot; While this statement is true , it is wrong to conclude that the current account deficit problem is over . 
he said improvement in the current account deficit during the past year was the result of cyclical , rather than structural factors and the fact that it had come off a high level . 
Kemp said national savings were too low to keep the current account deficit at a comfortable level . 
&quot; Higher national savings , which helps address the current account deficit and takes pressure off interest rates , can be expected to boost growth and employment over the medium term , &quot; he said . 
Kemp also said the government expected to meet its 8.25 percent unemployment rate target for 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; The government is also expecting a fall in the unemployment rate , although this will be muted to some extent as people are encouraged to enter or re-enter the workforce , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Hence , the unemployment rate is forecast to fall only modestly to around 8.25 percent by next June . 
employment growth was expected to strengthen through 1996 / 7 as a result of continued strong economic activity and expected moderation in real wage growth , he said .
