Miami Heat guards Dan Majerle and Gary Grant will both undergo back surgery on Thursday and each could be sidelined two months , the NBA club said on Wednesday . 
the Atlantic Division-leading Heat ( 31-12 ) suffered another bad injury blow last Friday when forward Kurt Thomas re-fractured his right ankle in a hotel in New York last Friday and is out indefinitely . 
the 31-year-old Majerle , in his ninth NBA season and first with the Heat , signed a three-year , $ 8 million contract during the off-season and has averaged 12.7 points and 5.1 rebounds in 26 games . 
grant , another nine-year veteran in his first season with the Heat , is averaging 3.9 points in 28 games . 
Thomas , put on the injured list Saturday , is averaging 6.3 points and 5.9 rebounds in just 18 games . 
the Heat , who hold a scant half-game lead over the New York Knicks , signed swingman Willie Anderson Tuesday for the remainder of the season to help compensate for the losses of Majerle and Grant . 
Anderson is a nine-year veteran who has played with San Antonio , Toronto and New York , averaging 12.7 points per game in his career .
