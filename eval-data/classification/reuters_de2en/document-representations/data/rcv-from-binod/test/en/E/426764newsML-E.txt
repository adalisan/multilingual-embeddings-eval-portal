international Monetary Fund ( IMF ) chief Michel Camdessus expressed confidence on Friday that Hong Kong would maintain its financial autonomy under Chinese rule . 
Camdessus held up Hong Kong as a shining example of fiscal success and said the British colony &apos;s prudent monetary and exchange rate policy had &quot; created an environment of macroeconomic stability and investor confidence &quot; . 
the IMF &apos;s managing director expressed confidence the Sino-British treaties governing the handover , which enshrine the principle of &quot; one country-two systems &quot; permitting Hong Kong considerable autonomy and fiscal independence would prevail . 
Hong Kong , a British colony for more than 150 years , reverts to China at midnight on June 30 , 1997 . 
the arrangements for Hong Kong &apos;s quasi-central bank , the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ( HKMA ) , and China &apos;s central bank , the People &apos;s Bank of China , to operate as two mutually independent but cooperative monetary authorities had been clearly established , Camdessus told an IMF-HKMA conference . 
Camdessus said China had a stake in maintaining Hong Kong &apos;s success . 
&quot; History , geographic location , openness in trade and importance as a financial centre all point to its ( Hong Kong &apos;s ) critical interest in continued global integration -- an interest that is shared in China , in the region and in the rest of the world . 
Hong Kong was &quot; a prime example of an economy that has managed rapid structural transformation in an increasingly integrated world economy in a most successful way &quot; , he said . 
Camdessus said the territory &apos;s sound legal and administrative framework , neutral civil service , impartial judicial system and freedom of information had all been critical to its economic success today &quot; and will remain so &quot; . 
Hong Kong was one of the world &apos;s most open economies and China was also moving towards greater openness , he said . 
&quot; One can easily see how promising this converging trend in China and Hong Kong is , &quot; he added . 
Hong Kong could be assured of the IMF &apos;s &quot; continuous interest &quot; and IMF and World Bank members would have a chance to see one country-two systems in action at the bank &apos;s annual meeting in the territory in September , Camdessus said .
