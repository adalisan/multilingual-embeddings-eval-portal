Hong Kong shares in London ended lower in a market lacking direction , despite significant gains in Hong Kong . 
&quot; The market is quiet and has lacked direction after the overnight close . 
there was not much trading today , but we hope for some short covering tomorrow , &quot; one dealer said . 
the Hang Seng London Reference Index ended 21.17 points , or 0.16 percent , lower at 13,145.99 after the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong ended 110.23 points higher to set a record closing high of 13,167.16 . 
the index set a new intraday high of 13,229.15 early in the day in Hong Kong .
