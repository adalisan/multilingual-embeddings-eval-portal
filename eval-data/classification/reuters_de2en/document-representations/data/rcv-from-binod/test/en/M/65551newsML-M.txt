LME copper was stronger but virtually ignored an announcement by Sumitomo that it had liquidated most of its positions , since many questions remain unanswered , dealers and analysts said . 
&quot; It &apos;s difficult to know whether this marks the final chapter , &quot; said Robin Bahr , analyst at broker Brandeis . 
three month prices popped up to a high of $ 1,953 per tonne in early trading , but modest strength had been expected after a bullish close on Wednesday , dealers said . 
by 0900 GMT , however , prices were back around $ 1,940 , the level attained in late trading on Wednesday evening . 
last kerb business on Wednesday was at $ 1,925 per tonne . 
it would take several days for the market to digest the news , which could be interpreted many ways , analysts said . 
&quot; It &apos;s bullish on the face of it , since it removes some uncertainty , but I don &apos;t think we should get too carried away , &quot; Bahr said . 
Sumitomo did not say how much copper had been liquidated and it could refer to passing positions on to banks , he said . 
the question of physical stocks was unclear , but if the firm has loosened its hold on LME stocks , that would be bearish for the market since more supplies would be available , Bahr said . 
if prices breached $ 1,950 , resistance was expected at the previous important level $ 20 higher . 
the spreads were little changed , with cash / threes indicated even after a $ 1 / $ 2 backwardation on Wednesday . 
most of other metals were holding around Wednesday &apos;s closing rates . 
aluminium was last at $ 1,430 , down $ 3 from Tuesday , after touching a high of $ 1,439 in early activity . 
resistance was expected at around $ 1,450 / 5 , support at $ 1,400 . 
prices may have difficulty making progress on the upside , with a break of $ 1,480 needed to improve negative charts . 
nickel was an exception to the generally little changed market , dropping sharply in early business by $ 110 to $ 7,350 , its low for the morning . 
&quot; The $ 7,350 level continues to be very important support and , if broken on a close , $ 7,200 would be targeted , &quot; said chartist Harry creates of broker AMT . 
lead was slightly lower at $ 785 , down $ 3 , and tin was unchanged at $ 6,140 . 
zinc was easier at $ 1,037 , down $ 4 , and alloy was little changed at $ 1,240 / 50 versus $ 1,245 / 50 .
