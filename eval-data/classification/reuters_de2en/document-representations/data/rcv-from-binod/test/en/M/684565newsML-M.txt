dealers said trading activity was thin as most dealers still prefered to stay on the sidelines to see how the new finance minister fared . 
&quot; People are still waiting to see what will happen next , &quot; said one Thai baht dealer in Singapore . 
&quot; We don &apos;t expect a devaluation , but you never know .

dealers in Singapore said the market remained quiet as most players appeared to square their positions ahead of the month-end . 
in the domestic market , the baht firmed to 25.850 / 25.910 early against 25.950 / 26.050 late on Monday on the U.S. unit &apos;s weakness abroad and easing demand for the dollar , dealers said . 
&quot; Dollar demand eased this morning . 
but some players still bought the dollar to cover positions ahead of the mid-year period , &quot; said one dealer at a European bank . 
the Bank of Thailand set the mid-rate at 25.78 per dollar against 25.81 on Monday . 
the Indonesian rupiah eased against the dollar in slow trading on Tuesday , dealers said . 
spot rupiah was last quoted at 2431.00 / 32.00 at 0320 GMT against an opening of 2429.50 / 30.50 . 
&quot; The dollar / rupiah appears capped at 2432 now as the market believes there are some heavy sell-orders at that level , &quot; said a dealer in Singapore . 
he said the current bottom for dollar / rupiah was around 2429.50 / 2430.00 . 
the central bank kept its intervention band at 2,424 / 2,616 and its conversion band also at 2,424 / 2,472 on Monday . 
the Malaysian ringgit fell against the dollar overnight amid rumours of intervention by Bank Negara in London . 
the ringgit fell again to below 2.5200 in Sydney but quickly recovered . 
&quot; Dollar / ringgit was pushed up to 2.5215 in Sydney but came back down quickly , &quot; said a European bank dealer in Kuala Lumpur . 
&quot; It triggered stop-loss dollar sales around 2.5190 / 00 . 
it closed at 2.5150 / 60 in Kuala Lumpur on Monday . 
dealers said fears of central bank intervention again capped the dollar &apos;s rise . 
in Singapore , the local dollar strenghtened through the morning to stand at 1.4267 / 77 at 0400 GMT after early trade at 1.4280 to the dollar . 
it also rose against the ringgit , with the Malaysian currency bid at 0.5667 from 0.5673 / 5 in early trade .
