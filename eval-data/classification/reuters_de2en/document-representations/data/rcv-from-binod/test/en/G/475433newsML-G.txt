Russia hopes a planned charter to define its relations with NATO will &quot; neutralise &quot; the negative effects of the alliance &apos;s enlargement for Moscow as far as possible , Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said on Saturday . 
Primakov , in Bonn to brief his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel on the results of the superpower summit in Helsinki , was cheerful and conciliatory despite the fact that NATO expansion is set to proceed with scant regard for Russia &apos;s objections . 
Primakov reiterated Moscow &apos;s often-stated position that NATO &apos;s admission of eastern European countries was a mistake , but repeatedly declined to dwell on the negative consequences . 
he told a news conference that Moscow had to be realistic and could assert its security interests through the NATO-Russia charter which it hopes to sign before a NATO summit in July , expected to invite new membership applications . 
&quot; If we succeed in signing a document of substance that defines our relationship with NATO , we will try to neutralise to the maximum extent , to the maximum possible , the consequences of NATO enlargement for our relations with the West , &quot; he said . 
Primakov struck an upbeat tone despite criticism at home , particularly from the communist-dominated parliament , that Russia had sold out vital security interests at the Helsinki summit between Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton . 
Primakov said it was &quot; very important &quot; for Russia that Clinton had reiterated to Yeltsin that NATO had no plans in the foreseeable future to deploy troops in eastern Europe . 
but he said intensive work still had to be done on the charter to counter Russian concerns &quot; that NATO infrastructure will roll towards our borders &quot; . 
Primakov was at pains to praise the constructive role played in the talks by Bonn , little more than a decade ago an ideological enemy which it would have been unthinkable for a Russian foreign minister to come and &quot; brief &quot; . 
next month Chancellor Helmut Kohl , the staunchest Western advocate of integrating Russia in Western economic and political structures , entertains Yeltsin for a two-day working visit . 
Kinkel said Germany believed it was important to show how relations with Russia now went far beyond military and geo-political issues . 
the two men discussed the thorny issue of the cultural treasures which victorious Soviet troops took from Germany at the end of World War Two , and which Bonn would like back . 
Primakov said the fact that Yeltsin had used his veto to block a Russian parliamentary bill which would have ruled out any return of the treasures &quot; shows that there is a special relationship between Russia and Germany &quot; . 
Kinkel chose to cement that relationship by inviting Primakov to spend two days with him over Easter , in the company of their wives , touring wine-growing areas in the kind of down-home diplomacy pioneered by Kohl . 
the idea appeared to be achieving its purpose of putting all the participants at their ease when Kinkel followed up appreciative comments on Yeltsin &apos;s veto of the art bill by personally welcoming Primakov &apos;s wife . 
the often-dour Primakov laughed and quickly added : &quot; I take it from the comments of Minister Kinkel that he sees my wife &apos;s visit as part of the transfer of cultural goods to Germany .
