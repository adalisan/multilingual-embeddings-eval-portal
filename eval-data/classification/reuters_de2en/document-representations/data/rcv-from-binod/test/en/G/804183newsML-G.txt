one of the leaders of Egypt &apos;s main Islamist militant group said on Saturday from exile that he was suspicious of a call by imprisoned founders of the group for a truce with the government . 
last month six leaders of the Gama &apos;a Al-Islamiya ( Islamic Group ) , serving life sentences for their role in the 1981 killing of President Anwar Sadat , issued a statement ordering followers to cease armed struggle against the government . 
&quot; For us ( those in exile ) , this truce call is ambiguous . 
there are a lot of question marks . 
hidden fingers are moving it , &quot; Yasser el-Serri , who lives in Britain after being sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian court , told Reuters by telephone . 
Serri , one of the main Gama &apos;a leaders , said he was in favour of an end to hostilities but only &quot; within the framework of a comprehensive and just solution &quot; . 
the truce call was welcomed by Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfi , the official at the forefront of the fight against the Moslem militants . 
it was also backed by Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman , the spiritual leader of the Gama &apos;a jailed in the United States for a plot to blow up New York City landmarks . 
but other exiled militant leaders expressed doubts about the call , saying they would continue their armed struggle . 
Egypt &apos;s official newspaper Al-Ahram on Saturday quoted Salah Hashem , who it said was a founder of the Gama &apos;a and its leader in the southern province of Sohag , as supporting the call to unconditionally lay down arms . 
&quot; Let &apos;s look for development and investment and put our hands in the state &apos;s hand ... We should give the fugitives in mountains and farms more chances ... to lay down arms and surrender , &quot; Hashem said , according to the paper . 
Serri condemned Hashem &apos;s remarks , saying they would hurt the safety of young Islamists . 
&quot; This is nonsense . 
this statement will ruin the youths . 
security must be for both parties , &quot; Serri said . 
Serri said all those detained under martial law should be set free and no civilians should be tried at military courts . 
&quot; I tell Salah Hashem : &apos; You yourself are a prisoner inside Egypt even if you are ( free ) in the street &apos; . 
Egyptian courts are trying more than 150 suspected Moslem militants in three simultaneous cases that analysts say are part of the government &apos;s bid to show it has the upper hand in the bloody war with Islamists . 
Serri said he doubted that Alfi was sincere in welcoming the ceasefire call and said the minister &apos;s statement on Monday did not refer to the fate of the numerous militants who have taken refuge in Egypt &apos;s mountains and sugar-cane fields . 
more than 1,000 people have been killed since Gama &apos;a took up arms in 1992 to overthrow the government and transform Egypt into a strict Islamic state . 
police say they have broken the back of the military wing of the Gama &apos;a through crackdowns and the number of attacks has declined sharply since the mid-1990s , when the militants were killing about one policeman a day .
