the U.S. government delivered a double dose of good news on the economy on Wednesday , saying wholesale prices dropped for an unprecedented seventh straight month in July , while sales at retail stores picked up steam . 
prices paid to producers of goods ranging from eggs to gasoline fell unexpectedly last month , the Labor Department said in a report offering more proof that the economy has managed to keep on expanding without producing inflation . 
the producer price index declined 0.1 percent in July following an identical drop in June . 
even without the volatile food and energy components , wholesale prices fell by 0.1 percent last month . 
&quot; This really tells us that on the short-term horizon there are certainly no price pressures whatsoever , &quot; said Anthony Chan , chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus , Ohio . 
at the same time , the Commerce Department released July figures showing retail sales rose 0.6 percent , compared with an upwardly revised 0.7 percent gain in June . 
the news sparked a rally in the U.S. Treasury bond market , which had slumped in previous sessions on fears of higher interest rates . 
the benchmark 30-year bond jumped 9 / 32 of a point , or $ 4.06 on a $ 1,000 bond , and its yield fell to 6.64 percent from 6.67 percent Tuesday . 
bond prices and yields move in opposite directions . 
while the sales report indicated that consumer demand is up this summer for just about everything but furniture , some of the impetus can be linked to aggressive discounting by retailers . 
car prices , for instance , have been falling in recent months , a factor helping to boost sales of new cars , which account for about one-fourth of total retail business . 
car sales rose 1 percent in July to $ 51.13 billion after a 1.4 percent rise in June . 
excluding new cars , total retail sales rose 0.5 percent in July and 0.4 percent in June , the Commerce Department said . 
so far this year , sales have jumped 4.6 percent from their level for the same 1996 period , with the economy now into its seventh consecutive year of uninterrupted growth . 
still , the retail sector &apos;s growth has been relatively moderate , which could help to keep inflationary pressures from mounting , some economists forecast . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t appear that consumer spending is going to cause the economy to move ahead too rapidly when the gain still can be characterized as moderate , &quot; said Lynn Reaser , chief economist at Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville , Fla . 
with employment growth strong and incomes rising , however , consumer spending could strengthen further in the months ahead . 
&quot; Very strong consumption is the greatest threat to the stable inflation environment , as it will trigger additional solid gains in employment and income , &quot; according to Joel Naroff , chief bank economist at First Union in Philadelphia . 
the new batch of data is expected to be considered by considered by Federal Reserve policy-makers next week when they decide whether economic growth is strong enough to require a hike in interest rates to keep inflation in check . 
&quot; The Fed will relax and do nothing when it meets next week , &quot; predicted Cliff Waldman , chief economist with the National Federation of Independent Business . 
&quot; Why fool with an economy so balanced that a recession is unlikely for a number of years ? 
still , the central bank will need to keep the possibility of a rate hike on &quot; its radar screen , &quot; Banc One &apos;s Chan said . 
&quot; We run the risk of growing above the speed limit , &quot; he said of the economy . 
in the July report on wholesale prices , the index &apos;s decline was paced in part by a drop of 0.2 percent in food costs . 
prices for beef , veal , fish and fresh fruit all posted declines . 
egg prices tumbled by 21.7 percent , the biggest drop since November 1995 . 
despite the overall decline in the price of food , prices for vegetables , poultry and pork all increased , the department said . 
energy costs inched up by 0.1 percent in July after rising by 0.7 percent the month earlier . 
gasoline prices , however , posted a drop of 1.0 percent , the report said . 
the data also showed little evidence that inflation may be gaining . 
overall prices of intermediate goods , which are used to make finished wholesale products , were down 0.2 percent in July . 
prices of crude goods , materials used at the beginning of the production process , fell by 0.1 percent .
