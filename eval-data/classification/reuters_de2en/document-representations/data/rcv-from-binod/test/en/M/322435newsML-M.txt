European stocks recovered on Tuesday from an early slide as Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan gave an upbeat report on the U.S. economy and failed to deliver the warning on overheating markets investors had feared . 
share markets , looking for an excuse to correct after a long New Year bull run , had fallen from record highs in the morning . 
but they stabilised when Greenspan did not repeat his comments made last December in a testimony to the U.S. Senate that financial markets had become irrationally exuberant . 
Greenspan &apos;s warning in December wiped billions of dollars off share values around the world . 
since then the Dow has risen about 400 points more and investors had worried Greenspan would strike again . 
but in his statement to the Senate budget committee , he described the stock markets &apos; performance only as breathtaking . 
&quot; The economy has retained considerable vigour , with few signs of the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions , &quot; he said . 
the Dow dipped as Greenspan spoke but investors could not resist the temptation to buy on the dips and by 1600 GMT it was was up 8.85 points from Monday &apos;s record close at 6,852 points . 
European markets , which had a rocky ride before the testimony , also took things in their stride . 
London &apos;s FTSE-100 , spooked in the morning by an interest rate warning from the British central bank governor , recovered from early lows and was down only 3.2 points at 4,190.8 . 
British investors bought heavily last week when finance minister Kenneth Clarke left interest rates unchanged . 
but the Bank of England governor , engaged in a tug of war with Clarke who has the final say on monetary policy , warned investors on Monday night that there were &quot; real dangers &quot; in letting sterling strength delay an interest rate rise . 
his comments rekindled market speculation that interest rates could go up in early February even though Clarke is not keen on the idea before the general election due by May . 
German shares also gained heart from Greenspan after morning falls triggered by an index from the IFO organisation indicating that the business climate remained soft . 
the DAX index , which fell through the 3,000 point barrier in early trade , closed down 53.97 points at 2,976.71 . 
but the Greenspan factor emerged in after-hours electronic trading , with the IBIS DAX-30 index closing back at 3,000.66 , up 1.47 . 
Paris followed the roller coaster trend , with the CAC-40 index well down in the morning but closing post-Greenspan at 2,409.88 , up 3.78 
on foreign exchange markets , the dollar took a breather after hitting an almost four year high against the yen on Monday . 
it closed little changed in Europe , underpinned by Greenspan but unable to build on gains made after his speech . 
the dollar was steady at 1.6254 marks compared with Monday &apos;s late European level of 1.6258 . 
against the yen it eased to 117.85 after breaching the the 118 barrier for the first time in almost four years on Monday . 
the dollar was trading at 117.85 yen and 1.6258 marks compared with Monday &apos;s late European levels of 117.97 and 1.6258 . 
the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 3.2 points at 4,190.8 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index closed at 2,409.88 , up 3.78 . 
gold was at $ 353.65 , compared with a $ 353.65 close in London on Monday . 
silver was at $ 4.73 after closing Monday at $ 4.75 .
