it will be news to those fleeing genocide or smarting under military dictators but Africa is on the road to recovery , according to the International Monetary Fund . 
beyond the media image of the &quot; The Dark Continent &quot; , Evangelos Calamitsis , head of the Fund &apos;s African Department , sees a bright economic future for countries adopting IMF reforms . 
&quot; This year in sub-Saharan Africa growth would be five percent or in that neighbourhood , a country like Ivory Coast will be higher , &quot; Calamitsis told Reuters . 
the IMF estimates Gross Domestic Product growth at 5.5 percent for 1996 compared with 4.6 percent in 1995 and 2.5 percent in 1994 for black Africa , excluding Nigeria and South Africa . 
countries exceeding that average are Ivory Coast , Uganda and Zimbabwe . 
the IMF did not include Sudan , Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa countries in its survey . 
Calamitsis sees the upward trend continuing if countries stay the course of painful structural adjustment reforms . 
they also have to immunise themselves against the plagues of political and ethnic violence sweeping the Great Lakes region and parts of West Africa . 
&quot; It &apos;s an unstable continent , &quot; said David Smock , an analyst at the United States Institute of Peace . 
&quot; Political problems have pulled down economies . 
Calamitsis acknowledges that the Fund has differences with Nigeria , the most populous and potentially wealthiest black African country . 
he also accepts that fighting in Zaire , Burundi and Rwanda blights economic prospects in much of Central Africa . 
he senses the scepticism , so asks and answers his own questions . 
&quot; Is the recovery true ? 
yes , this is what the numbers show . 
is it sustainable ? 
it remains to be seen . 
if these policies are sustained in the medium term , then yes , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We had the lost decade of the &apos; 80s . 
now we are seeing things turn around , good policies are beginning to take hold in a number of countries , &quot; he added . 
he said African leaders and economic planners were no longer hostile to exchange rate and interest rate reform , trade liberalisation and fiscal reform , even if it was painful at first . 
&quot; There has been a fundamental change of approach and a new breed of leadership in Africa sensitive to political and economic reform ... All the good policies that are required are now on the table , no policy issues in Africa are taboo , &quot; Calamitsis said . 
the near total economic collapse of some states had brought the realisation that &quot; alternative strategies don &apos;t work &quot; , he added . 
he said international donor debt relief policies had made many countries &apos; debt manageable . 
there had been little pickup in trade but inflation was moderating . 
the Fund said inflation would decline to an average 28.7 percent this year from 41.1 percent in 1995 and 59.3 percent in 1994 in sub-Saharan Africa . 
the 1994 figure was distorted by the devaluation of the CFA franc . 
Africa &apos;s image of political instability and economic mismanagement still persists in many investors &apos; minds , but portfolio equity flows rose to $ 830 million last year from $ 812 million in 1994 for the sub-Saharan region , World Bank figures show . 
this ranks it second to last in the table of developing regions , above the Middle East . 
&quot; Direct foreign investment in Africa has been relatively poor ... but there &apos;s still interest in some parts like South Africa , Kenya , Ivory Coast and Ghana , &quot; Calamitsis said . 
the biggest interest is in mining . 
Washington-based economists and political analysts are heartened by the relatively peaceful transformation of South Africa from apartheid , but they note no enthusiasm on the part of Pretoria to become the engine of recovery for the whole continent . 
they are even more pessimistic about Nigeria , the economic powerhouse to the north which is under military rule . 
&quot; We continue to be concerned about developments in Nigeria , &quot; Calamitsis said . 
other economists , off the record , are more forthright , citing corruption , particularly in the oil sector , as a major deterrent to foreign investment . 
the Fund is anxious for Nigeria , once again , to scrap its dual exchange rate , cut the budget deficit and rein in inflation which swings between 40 and 70 percent . 
&quot; Nigeria is the greatest failure of all economically , &quot; Smock said . 
but he too , tries to counter the pessimism which has shrouded much of Africa . 
&quot; If five or six countries could show the way economically this could have an impact on rest of the countries , &quot; he said citing the brighter prospects of Uganda , Zimbabwe , Zambia . 
but as in the past , politics clouds the horizon . 
&quot; Before Central Africa the balance between successes and failures was positive , &quot; Smock said . 
&quot; But it is really hard to be optimist after the Great Lakes . 
it shows how conflict can spill over .
