Pakistan said on Friday it had urged the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to restrain India from posing a missile threat to it as the two neighbours schedule a new round of peace talks for June 19-23 . 
the Foreign Ministry said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had written to leaders of the United States , Russia , China , Britain and France , &quot; drawing their attention to the serious degradation in the security environment of our region resulting from the deployment of the ( medium-range ) Prithvi missiles by India &quot; . 
&quot; He has reminded them of their special responsibility for the preservation of international peace and security and urged them to call upon India to exercise restraint , &quot; a ministry spokesman told reporters at a news briefing . 
he said Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan had also written to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the matter . 
Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral has denied a U.S. newspaper report of the deployment of the Prithvis , which Islamabad says pose a threat that Pakistan will take &quot; necessary measures &quot; to meet . 
the Washington Post last week quoted U.S. intelligence agencies as saying India had moved less than a dozen Prithvis near Jullundur in the north-eastern state of Punjab . 
&quot; The deployment of Prithvi missiles across our borders entails a qualitative change in the security environment in South Asia , &quot; the Pakistani spokesman said . 
&quot; We feel that our region can ill-afford a missile race . 
at the same time , we have to address our legitimate security concerns and will take all necessary measures to meet any threat . 
there have been repeated reports that Pakistan obtained M-11 missiles from China , which Islamabad denies . 
both India and Pakistan said on Friday that top foreign ministry officials of the two countries would meet in Islamabad on June 19-23 , and the Pakistani spokesman said the reported missile deployment could be discussed . 
the talks will follow a rare meeting between the two countries &apos; prime ministers in May during a South Asian summit conference in the Maldivian capital of male , and an earlier round of negotiations in March in New Delhi , which ended a tense three-year stand-off . 
&quot; We have entered into the dialogue with seriousness of purpose , &quot; the Pakistani spokesman said . 
&quot; We are making all efforts to sustain this process so that all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan , including the core issue of ( the disputed Himalayan region ) of Jammu and Kashmir are meaningfully addressed . 
any escalatory action or provocation which vitiates the atmosphere must be avoided . 
Pakistan on Thursday accused India of raising tension before the talks with a recent alleged airspace violation , the reported missile deployment and a border clash on Tuesday in which a Pakistani army major was killed . 
India promptly denied the charge . 
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence in 1947 , two of them over Kashmir . 
India rules two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest . 
the last round of talks between the two countries in January 1994 derailed over Kashmir . 
India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Moslem rebels fighting New Delhi &apos;s rule in Kashmir , while Islamabad says it provides them only moral and diplomatic support . 
Pakistan says Kashmir is the core issue that the neighbours must resolve , while India says it is keen to make progress in other areas such as trade .
