Hong Kong people seemed less positive about China &apos;s resumption of sovereignty three weeks after Britain returned its former colony to Beijing , a survey said on Tuesday . 
the handover on July 1 ended more than 150 years of British colonial rule . 
almost 12 percent of 538 polled by Hong Kong University on July 8 were positive about the sovereignty changeover , a drop of some 20 percentage points compared with a similar survey on July 1 . 
some 76 percent were neutral towards the handover , the survey said , but it did not ask respondents why they were positive or negative about the handover . 
&quot; This drop , I think , was due to the passing away of all the excitement due to the celebration activities , &quot; said Robert Chung , who conducted the polls . 
&quot; Probably about 20 percent of the public were excited because they liked to watch the fireworks and all the celebration activities . 
but a week passed , they went back to normal life and they were no longer excited about the transition , &quot; he said . 
Hong Kong &apos;s new government has been embroiled with legal challenges over the legitimacy of its legal system and the right to deport illegal child migrants from mainland China after the handover . 
outside the courts , post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa also faced mounting pressure from pro-democracy groups and trade unions in Hong Kong after suspending three labour rights laws passed a week before the July 1 changeover .
