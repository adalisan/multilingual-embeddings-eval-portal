German shares ended Wednesday &apos;s bourse trade slightly higher , but at the day &apos;s low point , after the dollar slipped and German bonds lost some Sheen following the surprise raising of the UK interest rate . 
the DAX index of 30 blue-chip shares closed up 5.11 points , or 0.19 percent , at 2,678.73 , slipping back about ten points after Britain raised its base interest rate by 25 basis points to six percent . 
German players took the move as a signal that German interest rates would not sink further in the future . 
German exporting stocks also suffered after the dollar lost ground against the mark , slipping under 1.51 marks . 
earlier the DAX had touched 2,691.55 , encouraged by a firm close on Wall Street overnight , but volumes had been thin , dealers said . 
one of the most heavily traded DAX stocks was German &apos;s largest commercial bank , Deutsche Bank , which rose 94 pfennigs to touch 71.30 marks , after it said management board member Rolf Breuer would suceed Hilmar Kopper as chief executive . 
the stock lost some of its gains to end bourse trade up 49 pfennigs , or 0.7 percent , at 70.85 marks . 
meanwhile shares in carmaker Volkswagen ignored news that German courts had dismissed its law suit against Opel , a unit of U.S. firm General Motors . 
VW shares rose 10.75 marks , or 1.8 percent , to 600.75 marks in bourse dealings . 
VW had sought 10 million marks in the suit , which was the latest twist in the ongoing legal battle between the two carmakers over charges top GM officials left for VW in 1993 and brought along trade secrets . 
dealers called the stock &apos;s rise &quot; illogical &quot; and said it should have been hurt by the news of the dismissal of the law suit . 
business software firm SAP had been the darling of the bourse , but plummeted last week after a profits warning .
