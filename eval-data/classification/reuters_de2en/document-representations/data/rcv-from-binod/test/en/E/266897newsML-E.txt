Colombia &apos;s economy should return to vigorous growth in the second half of 1997 at the latest , Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo said Thursday . 
and while Ocampo predicted the strongest growth of 1997 would come after June , he repeated Wednesday &apos;s comments that signs of recovery were already visible and that business optimism was on the rise . 
&quot; I expect the economy will take off midway through next year . 
the first half of 1997 will be a period of recovery and that optimism is already being seen in business surveys , &quot; Ocampo told the Caracol radio network . 
although the 1996 growth in gross domestic product was just 3.0 percent , he said the economic slump had not been as bad as some critics had first feared . 
GDP growth was down from 5.28 percent in 1995 but not as low as the 1991 result -- the worst of the decade so far -- of 2.0 percent . 
Ocampo &apos;s predictions coincide with those of private business analysts who are forecasting a general upturn in the economy , spearheaded by growth in the recession-hit construction industry , from July 1997 . 
private analysts still have doubts , however , about the prospects for key exports sectors next year .
