Moldovan Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc said on Saturday that the government would press ahead with economic reforms and concentrate on boosting the role of the private sector . 
&quot; We are convinced that it is only through social and economic reforms that we can improve the situation in Moldova , &quot; he told the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) . 
Ciubuc called for support from international institutions but made no reference to a threat this week by the International Monetary Fund to suspend a $ 195-million three-year loan programme because of what it called an unsatisfactory economic performance . 
&quot; Without foreign investment and support from international institutions it will be difficult for Moldova to solve the problems it faces in the transition to a market economy , &quot; Ciubuc said . 
&quot; Increasing participation of the private sector in the economy is going to make the republic more attractive to foreign investors , &quot; he added . 
over 40 percent of Moldova &apos;s gross domestic product comes from the private sector . 
the energy and agro-business sectors have been targetted as priority areas for restructuring and privatisation . 
Deputy Prime Minister Ion Gutu , responsible for the economy and reforms , said Moldova had lagged behind in restructuring at the micro-economic level . 
world Bank representatives in Moldova have voiced concern at the slow pace of structural reforms in the former Soviet republic of 4.4 million people , located between Ukraine and Romania . 
Moldova , which had built up a reputation as one of the fastest reforming members of the Commonwealth of Independent States , saw output continue to fall last year . 
&quot; We are really gearing our efforts to restructuring our domestic industrial enterprises , &quot; Gutu said . 
&quot; We must single out those sectors of the economy that are viable from those doomed to fail . 
Gutu said the emphasis would be on creating and strengthening small- and medium-sized companies and many of these would be sold off at auctions in the coming days .
