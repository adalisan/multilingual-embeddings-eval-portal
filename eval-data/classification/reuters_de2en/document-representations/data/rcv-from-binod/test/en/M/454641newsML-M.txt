* Banks see interest rates bottoming out 
Manila overnight money remained at 10.03125 percent in a liquid market on Wednesday , with rates moving from 10.25 to 10.03125 percent . 
market volume was still high at 14.301 billion pesos from 13.469 billion pesos , reflecting the high liquidity in the market , traders said . 
however , more sellers of T-bills emerged at the secondary market after the lukewarm response to yesterday &apos;s sales of seven-year T-bonds , traders said . 
the auction of seven-year T-bonds was undersubscribed with tenders totalling 3.34 billion pesos against planned sales of 3.5 billion pesos . 
&quot; We &apos;ve hit a resistance at these levels , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; Interest rates are seen bottoming out , &quot; a second dealer said , adding banks are now taking profits . 
a Reuter poll of six financial institutions gave offer rates of 9.70 to 9.75 on three-month bills , 10.0 to 10.10 percent on the six-month bills , and 10.45 to 10.50 percent for the one-year bills .
