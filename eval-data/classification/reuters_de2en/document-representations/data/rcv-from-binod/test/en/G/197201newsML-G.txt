defence ministers from the Western European Union will discuss on Tuesday the defence grouping &apos;s growing links with NATO and to see how the WEU can help in Africa &apos;s troubled Great Lakes region . 
diplomats said the meeting in the Belgian port would also announce the setting up of a Western European Armament Organisation to coordinate defence research in a continent facing reduced defence budgets and non-stop technological growth . 
the main thrust of the meeting , which began on Monday , will be for the WEU ministers to take stock of what WEU and NATO diplomats say has been a remarkably speedy preparation for a new relationship between the defence groups . 
NATO agreed in June to the concept of Combined Joint Task Forces ( CJTF ) in which the WEU would borrow troops and equipment from the Atlantic alliance for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations . 
the move was taken partly in response to increasing calls by EU members to have their own identity in NATO under which they could carry out operations without the non-EU members of NATO , notably the United States . 
EU diplomats said that as the general principle has been agreed , all that remained was for the WEU and NATO to hammer out exactly what kind of mission the equipment could be used for , and exactly how to cooperate with NATO . 
&quot; The Ostend meeting should sketch out illustrative scenarios on which kinds of mission it would use the NATO means for , &quot; a Belgian foreign ministry spokesman told reporters last week . 
at Belgium &apos;s request , the ministers will also examine how WEU could help in a Canadian-led military intervention in Eastern Zaire . 
although it is not a question of sending a full-scale WEU force , it has been suggested that WEU troops could be used to help coordinate transport of U.N. troops and humanitarian aid and provide other logistical support .
