Manchester United virtually guaranteed themselves a place in the European Cup semifinals for the first time since 1969 when they imperiously crushed Porto 4-0 in the first leg of their quarter-final on Wednesday . 
United &apos;s outstanding performance was highlighted by goals from David May ( 22nd ) , Eric Cantona ( 34th ) , Ryan Giggs ( 61st ) and Andy Cole ( 80th ) and evoked memories of their greatest victory which came in the 1968 European Cup final against Porto &apos;s Portuguese rivals Benfica . 
Porto , who had won all three away matches in the Champions &apos; League phase of the competition , were simply overwhelmed for much of the match . 
the first goal came when David Beckham &apos;s long cross was headed on by Gary Pallister . 
goalkeeper Hilario failed to hold the ball and May swept it home from close range . 
the outstanding Cantona made it two when he took advantage of a mistake by Aloisio to lash the ball under Hilario &apos;s body from 12 metres and Giggs completed the 21-year-old goalkeeper &apos;s personal nightmare when he failed to stop a shot from Giggs squeezing past him on his near post . 
Cantona was the provider for Cole to score United &apos;s fourth .
