dark northern spring wheat bids were slightly higher on Friday , in line with gains in MGE spring wheat futures , but movement remained slow as farmers waited for higher prices , cash grain dealers said . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty quiet , &quot; a Montana dealer said . 
&quot; A lot of people are getting anxious to sell but they &apos;re still not happy with the price . 
one Minnesota dealer said movement was further slowed by a widely circulated report saying the IRS might impose a tax on certain deferred-payment grain contracts . 
while accountants downplayed the significance , farmers were concerned , he said . 
&quot; They want some of the money up front and now they &apos;ve got the government saying they can &apos;t do deferred payment contracts tax-free , &quot; the dealer said . 
&quot; The IRS , to a certain degree , is dictating grain movement this year . 
farmers have relied on the contracts for years as a means of deferring tax payments . 
traditionally , they sell the grain at the end of the year and defer payment -- and tax bills -- until the following year . 
but IRS ruled last December that a potato farmer in Washington state had to report income from a deferred-payment contract in the same year .
