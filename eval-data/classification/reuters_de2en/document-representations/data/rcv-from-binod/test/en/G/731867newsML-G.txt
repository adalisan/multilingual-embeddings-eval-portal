the largest Czech opposition party , the Social Democrats , maintained their eight percentage point lead over Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus &apos;s Civic Democratic Party in an IVVM opinion poll released on Wednesday . 
the state-funded demographics agency said that 28 percent of the potential electorate surveyed from June 30-July 7 said they would vote for the centre-left Social Democrats ( CSSD ) , unchanged from a similar poll in June . 
meanwhile , Klaus &apos;s Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) which has been battered by a recent economic downturn and falling approval ratings , stabilised at 20 percent , the same as in June , after falling to 18 percent support in May . 
IVVM said the popularity of the centrist partner in the ruling centre-right coaliton , the Christian Democrats ( KDU-CSL ) , was unchanged at 11.5 percent , while the third coalition party , the pro-business Civic Democratic Alliance ( ODA ) , gained one point to eight percent . 
the far-left opposition Communist party gained one point to nine percent while the far-right opposition Republicans were unchanged at four percent . 
the next general elections to the lower house are scheduled for mid-year 2000 . 
some analysts and politicians have forecast that instability within the three-party coalition and poor popularity of the current government may bring an early poll . 
* Note . 
July 1996 results for stem reflect the actual vote count from general elections in June last year , while IVVM conducted its own survey for that month . 
the new IVVM poll ( listed as left figure in each column ) was conducted June 30 - July 7 from a sample of 721 people aged 18 and over and has a margin of error of 1-3 percent . 
the new stem poll ( right results ) reflect 1,601 respondents in the first week of July and have been rounded to the nearest full number , with no margin of error disclosed . 
the remaining balance of both polls is comprised of those saying they had no preference .
