Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Saturday Moscow would cooperate with the winner of breakaway Chechnya &apos;s presidential election on Monday . 
&quot; Let &apos;s see whom the Chechens elect as their leader . 
it is the will of the Chechen people and not to heed the will of the people is impermissible , &quot; he said during a speech in Moscow . 
&quot; We will work with the leaders , the president , the leadership that will be organised after the elections , &quot; he told a gathering of his Our Home is Russia movement . 
all 16 of the Chechen presidential candidates support independence for the tiny southern region . 
Russia sent troops into Chechnya in 1994 to crush its independence drive but pulled them out less than two years later after humiliating defeats , leaving the region with its de facto sovereignty intact . 
some Russian officials have publicly expressed their concerns that the Chechen elections are another step in the region &apos;s move toward full independence , but Chernomyrdin &apos;s remarks appeared to signal Moscow &apos;s acceptance of their outcome . 
&quot; I &apos;m sure that the leadership of Russia will find a possibility to cooperate with the leadership elected by the Chechen people -- if there is a desire from the other side , &quot; he said .
