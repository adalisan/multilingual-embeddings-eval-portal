wall Street economists had expected the advance estimate of fourth quarter GDP growth to show a 3.9 percent increase , the price index to be up 2.2 percent and the implicit deflator to rise 1.8 percent . 
commerce said that the price index for gross domestic purchases , which measures prices paid by U.S. residents , increased by 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year after rising by 1.9 percent in the third . 
&quot; The step-up in prices was more than accounted for by energy prices , which increased in the fourth quarter after decreasing in the third , &quot; the department said . 
department officials said that the 4.9 percent rise in final sales last quarter was the largest since the fourth quarter of 1993 , when that figure posted a 5.0 percent increase . 
they said the acceleration in consumer spending in the fourth quarter was mainly in services -- household utilities and brokerage services -- and was due to colder than usual weather and a buoyant stockmarket . 
on a fourth-quarter-on-fourth-quarter basis , GDP rose by 3.4 percent in 1996 compared with a 1.3 percent increase in 1995 . 
in putting together the fourth quarter figures , the department had to make several assumptions about key data in December that have not yet been compiled . 
specifically , it assumed that the trade deficit in goods excluding gold increased in December and that the pace of inventory investment outside the auto industry slowed dramatically from November .
