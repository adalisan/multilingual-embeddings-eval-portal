international Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus has urged the Angolan government and rebel Unita movement to work toward a joint reconstruction to restore confidence in its economy . 
&quot; We hope that from the moment a unity government is installed it should begin finding the key elements of a programme of reconstruction based on stability and reforms , &quot; Camdessus said at the start of a three-day visit . 
he told a joint ceasefire commission meeting on Monday night that his visit was aimed at finding the best way to restructure Angola &apos;s war-ravaged economy . 
&quot; I have held meetings with the government and the economic team aimed at seeing how to establish the best possible programme to spare the Angolan people additional suffering , &quot; he said . 
economists in Luanda said the IMF would look specifically at government efforts to make its oil account more transparent and steps to reduce inflation and the budget deficit . 
Camdessus &apos; visit comes after the IMF withdrew its representative last year after the MPLA-led government failed to implement real economic reforms for the fourth time since 1987 .
