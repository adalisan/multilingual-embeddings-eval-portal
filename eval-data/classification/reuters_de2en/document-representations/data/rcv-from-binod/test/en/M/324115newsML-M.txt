the steady rise in short sterling since the beginning of the year has left little value along the strip and made it vulnerable to a correction should signs of stronger economic activity emerge , analysts said . 
but with a number of short positions in the market still to be shaken out in the next few days , and receeding chances of an interest rate rise before the election , the front contract may yet offer some value , analysts added . 
short sterling rose by around 10 to 14 basis points right along the strip on Wednesday after weaker than expected December retail sales data added to expectations interest rates may remain on hold at 6.0 percent ahead of the election . 
by 1610 GMT the March contract was up eight basis points at 93.67 , implying official rates of around 6.33 percent by the end of the quarter . 
Union plc chief economist Philip Shaw said if rates do remain on hold ahead of the election , which must be held by May , this contract may provide some value . 
&quot; In terms of March , you &apos;re looking at three-month rates being 6.30 to 6.40 percent . 
it is possible three-month money goes out at 6.25 percent , if there &apos;s no interest rate increase next month , so you could argue that there is still a little bit of value , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Even with March there doesn &apos;t look to be too many interesting opportunities , &quot; he said . 
&quot; And I would probably expect to see those longer contracts correct a bit . 
further out , the June contract was up 12 basis points at 93.45 , the September was up 14 bps at 93.21 and the December contract was up 15 bps at 93.04 . 
that implies official rates of around seven percent by the end of the year , bang in line with expectations , according to a But analysts said any sign Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is putting politics before economics and keeping rates on hold in the face of stronger economic activity , would likely prompt a correction in the longer contracts . 
a growing number of analysts now expect Clarke to withstand increasing public pressure from the Bank of England for a rate rise and leave them unchanged at the February 5 monetary meeting . 
&quot; politically , February is Clarke &apos;s last opportunity to tighten policy , so the market &apos;s perception is that if he doesn &apos;t do it then , he won &apos;t before the election , &quot; said Shaw . 
&quot; So if we get firmer data on activity or disappointing inflation numbers , the curve will take the strain . 
much of the potential value in short sterling depends on the extent to which the pound &apos;s recent rise can stem inflationary pressure , analysts said . 
&quot; Much of whether short sterling is good value depends on whether you think the currency will exert much of a squeeze on economic activity , &quot; said Shaw . 
&quot; If that is the case , then base rates could end the year below seven percent in which case there is obvious value there . 
short sterling has had a rollar-coaster ride in recent months as expectations of an imminent rate rise have been scaled back in the face of weaker than expected economic acitivity . 
and with an election just four months away at most , the strip should be carefully watched , analysts said . 
&quot; Looking down the list , the March to June spread , which spans an election , discounts a 24 basis point change between the two contracts , which doesn &apos;t seem like a lot , &quot; said Capelton . 
Wednesday &apos;s 0.8 percent fall in retail sales in December also had knock-on effects in the gilt repo market , traders said . 
&quot; The curve flattened considerably , &quot; said one . 
&quot; People are looking to buy general collateral . 
they &apos;re not looking for a rate rise in February now so there &apos;s been a fair bit of readjusting . 
he said there was some interest in the 7.25 percent gilt due 2007 , the new auction stock announced by the Bank on Tuesday . 
he said the stock was bid 50 basis points through general collateral at two months . 
he said onvernight general collateral was trading around 5.95 percent .
