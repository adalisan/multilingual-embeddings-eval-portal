Harrison Roth , senior options strategist at Cowen &amp; Co , said it appeared the leaps investor bought the 80-strike puts and sold the 65-strike ones . 
&quot; It &apos;s a new trade on both sides , &quot; he said . 
&quot; buying the 80 put and selling the 65 put to reduce cost . 
the LSX 80 put traded about 10,100 contracts , the 100 call traded 3,000 , the 75 put traded 1,750 and the 77-1 / 2 put traded 1,600 . 
Roth said it was difficult to determine what those investors were doing . 
the LSX 80 put had open interest of 6,382 through Wednesday and the 100 call was added today so had no contracts open . 
&quot; Everyone &apos;s sitting around . 
among the few highlights , one institution sold 2,000 June 850 calls and another institution was selling May 810 calls . 
in the March series , the most action was in the 780 , where 5,375 contracts changed hands , and the 820 call , where about 5,200 changed hands . 
the only OEX call trading more than 4,000 contracts was the March 800 , with volume of about 4,160 . 
the March 745 put traded about 7,065 and the March 780 put traded 6,400 , making them the most active OEX puts . 
the underlying index was down 8.42 at 776.17 .
