U.S. stocks fell Tuesday after nervous investors locked in profits from Monday &apos;s record rally amid growing speculation that the Fed would engineer another interest rate rise , analysts said . 
the stock market &apos;s mild losses were surprising because they defied steeper losses in the bond market .

we &apos;ve got multiple excuses to pull out the rug from under the Dow . 
it &apos;s acting very well considering the circumstances , &quot; said said Al Goldman , chief market analyst for A.G. Edwards and sons . 
the mild losses in stocks came amid a downturn in the T-bond market and ahead of several key inflation reports due this week . 
however , several economists said this week &apos;s data should not contain any unexpected inflationary signals that could spook Wall Street .

the long bond fell 14 / 32 , pushing the yield to 6.92 percent . 
&quot; They could easily justify one more rate hike but not a series of rate hikes . 
we still don &apos;t see the whites of inflation &apos;s eyes yet . 
although you could argue we see some seeds being planted , &quot; said Anthony Chan , chief economist for Banc One , citing low productivity and capacity utilization rates among other factors . 
Chan said considering the headstrong gains made in the stock market in the past few weeks , he does not believe stock market has fully priced in the possibility of rate hike . 
despite their modest closing levels , the Dow industrials exhibited some of their recent trademark volatility , lurching down 50 points late in the session , prompting curbs in index-arbitrage trading . 
but the average recovered , with the curbs lifted about ten minutes later .
