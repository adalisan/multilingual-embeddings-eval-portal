the Bulgarian Lev closed around 525-530 per dollar in light interbank volume , down from 510-515 in the morning and weaker than 515-520 at the previous close , as dollar demand topped supply in the afternoon , dealers said . 
&quot; Some final clients were bidding for dollars in the afternoon , but supply was insufficient and the Lev lost ground , &quot; a dealer said . 
dealers said they were not sure if large energy importers were among the buyers . 
dollar bids from fuel and energy importers pressured the Lev to 530-535 on Monday from 362-364 a week earlier . 
the central bank was not seen supporting the Lev on the market in the afternoon , dealers said . 
Central bank officials were not immediately available for comment . 
foreign currency supply briefly rose in the morning on profit-taking and because final clients needed levs for pending payments , dealers said . 
the central bank was seen bidding for dollars in the morning , absorbing part of the rise .
