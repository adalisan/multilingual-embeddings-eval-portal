the Islamic Taleban militia said on Tuesday that northern opposition leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum had lost two more cities to pro-Taleban mutineers within his forces . 
Maulvi Wakil Ahmad , a senior Taleban official based in the southern city of Kandahar , told the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press ( AIP ) that forces led by a disaffected Dostum commander , General Abdul Malik , had captured Kunduz , capital of Kunduz province , and Sar-i-Pul , capital of Jowzjan province . 
there was no independent confirmation of the latest reported advances by Malik &apos;s troops , who launched a Taleban-backed rebellion against Dostum in four northern provinces on Monday . 
Malik declared support for the Taleban on Monday and said he had captured 5,000 Dostum soldiers and two provinces , including Faryab , to the west of Dostum &apos;s stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif . 
Taleban radio said in a broadcast from Kabul on Monday night that the Islamic militia was advancing on Faryab after breaking through Dostum &apos;s defences . 
it gave no details . 
AIP said on Monday Dostum seemed to have kept control of Mazar-i-Sharif , but there has been no word on his whereabouts .
