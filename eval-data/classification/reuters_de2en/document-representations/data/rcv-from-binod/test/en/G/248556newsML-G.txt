Hungary &apos;s Parliament Tuesday night put the final seal on the country &apos;s historic basic treaty with Romania by ratifying the accord with large majority provided by the parties of the ruling coalition . 
the treaty , which lays new foundations for the two country &apos;s relations , is vital for their ambitions to join the European Union . 
differences over the treatment of Romania &apos;s 1.6-million-strong ethnic Hungarian minority made relations strained before the signature of the treaty . 
foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs said in its conclusion to the discussion of the treaty that the treaty was a large step ahead though nobody expected it to solve every conflict between the two countries overnight . 
&quot; The document is regarded , also abroad , as a step towards reconciliation to be reached in a European manner , &quot; Kovacs said . 
the parliament decided on the ratification with 249 votes in favour , 53 against and 12 abstentions , Hungarian papers said on Wednesday . 
Romania &apos;s Senate approved the treaty in September . 
the Socialists and the Free Democrats , the member parties of the ruling coalition which holds 278 votes of 386 in the parliament , voted in favour of the treaty , while the parties of the right-wing opposition did not support the ratification . 
the opposition earlier heavily criticised the treaty , saying the accord did not assure sufficient rights for Romania &apos;s ethnic Hungarians and would influence the Romanian elections held last month . 
the treaty &apos;s opponents had said that the signing of the accord would strengthen re-election chances of Romanian leftist ex-President Ion Iliescu and weaken the positions of UDMR , the party of ethnic Hungarians in Romania . 
but Iliescu and its ruling party were toppled by the Romanian opposition and UDMR takes part in the new ruling coalition . 
however , opposition politicians said the haste with which Hungary agreed on the treaty with the previous government was unfortunate as the present Romanian leaders would probably make more lenient negotiating partners . 
Gyorgy Csoti of the opposition party MDF was quoted as saying by the national MTI news agency that his party had voted against the treaty because it was weak and incomplete . 
Ex-foreign minister Geza Jeszenszky of the opposition party MDNP said the treaty could mislead foreign observers , giving the impression that all the problems of ethnic Hungarians in Romania were solved .
