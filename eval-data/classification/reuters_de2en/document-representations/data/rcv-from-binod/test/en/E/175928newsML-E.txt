Croatia will not introduce a new VAT ( Value-Added-Tax ) system on January 1 , 1997 as previously announced , a major state-run newspaper said on Friday , quoting an unnamed ruling party official . 
Parliament passed a bill earlier this year stipulating that a single 22 percent VAT would replace a complicated turnover tax as of the New Year . 
but the ruling party -- Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) -- decided earlier this week to put off the launch of the new system , a source close to the party headquarters told the Zagreb newspaper Vjesnik . 
the HDZ feared that a sudden rise in prices could cause social unrest and damage its chances to stay in power in the presidential and local elections due next year . 
&quot; The implementation of the Value Added Tax would surely lead to a rise in prices of some strategic products , including food stuffs , &quot; the source said , adding that the new system would be postponed for at least few months . 
no government offical was available for comment .
