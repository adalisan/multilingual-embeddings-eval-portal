moderate issuance in the U.S. high-yield bond market on Thursday was led by a $ 200 million offering from Venezuela &apos;s CANTV Finance Ltd , dealers said . 
investment grade issuance , meanwhile , will pale in comparison to Wednesday &apos;s $ 2.5 to $ 3 billion in volume , syndicates said . 
most new issues were flat to firmer . 
--General Motor &apos;s GMAC $ 1.0 billion global five-year notes were quoted unchanged from Wednesday &apos;s close at 41 bid-lock , traders said . 
the issue was priced at 42 basis points over the U.S. Treasury curve . 
--GTE Corp $ 500 million 30-year debentures traded near the initial issue spread of 97.5 basis points . 
the deal was priced by a Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co syndicate . 
investment grade issuance , beefed up by the three-month deluge of capital securities , has added up for one of the busiest January &apos;s in recent years , according to several seasoned syndicate members . 
that volume is expected to slow during the next two weeks , they added . 
&quot; This market has absorbed the supply surprisingly well and we think things will begin to let up going forward , &quot; one syndicate manager said . 
&quot; Trust issues , for one , will subside . 
back in the high-yield market , CANTV Finance Ltd issued $ 100 million 8.875 percent five-year notes to yield 260 basis points over the Treasury note . 
another tranche of $ 100 million 9.25 percent notes due 2004 was priced to yield 285 basis points over the Treasury curve . 
CANTV was more than five times oversubscribed with orders from a range of emerging markets , high-yield , crossover high-grade and European investors , according to the Chase Securities syndicate . 
other high-yield issues set to price on Thursday are $ 100 million senior subordinated notes from Vintage Petroleum Inc from Salomon Brothers in the 215 to 230 basis point range and $ 125 million senior notes from Advanced Radio Telecom Corp from Merrill Lynch .
