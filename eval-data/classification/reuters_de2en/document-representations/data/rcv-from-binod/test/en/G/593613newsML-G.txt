Socialist opposition leader Lionel Jospin said on Sunday he would oppose Gaullist President Jacques Chirac &apos;s move to bring France back into NATO &apos;s military wing if a forthcoming parliamentary election took him to power . 
Jospin said Chirac &apos;s initiative could be thwarted as France was not getting the concessions it asked for in return , including the transfer of NATO &apos;s southern command to a European officer . 
&quot; I believe I heard it said that , if we could not obtain the concessions the move would be aborted , &quot; he told France 3 television in an interview . 
&quot; If it were ... it would suit me fully , &quot; he said . 
Washington has rejected relinquishing the Naples-based southern command which includes control over the U.S. Mediterranean Sixth Fleet . 
Jospin said he had never agreed to the government &apos;s move , and he was surprised that it was made by a disciple of the late General Charles de Gaulle who had taken France out of the Atlantic alliance &apos;s military organisation . 
opinion polls released at the weekend said Chirac &apos;s centre-right coalition &apos;s lead was slipping a week ahead of the first round of the May 25-June 1 election to the National Assembly .
