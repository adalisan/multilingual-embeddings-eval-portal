the United States sees no quick solution to a dispute with France over who is to command NATO &apos;s vital southern flank , an emotive issue with major political ramifications in both countries . 
but U.S. officials are hopeful that they can agree with Paris a formula that would in effect defer the issue well into the future , allowing the 16-nation alliance to focus on other matters that Washington considers more pressing . 
ever since NATO was set up in 1949 , an American officer has held the Naples-based southern command , which carries with it control of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean . 
now , France is demanding that the post be turned over to a European . 
this , Defence Minister Charles Millon has warned , could be the price if France is to carry out its plan to rejoin NATO &apos;s military structure , which it left 30 years ago . 
as NATO prepares for its regular foreign ministers &apos; winter meeting in Brussels next Tuesday , France is pushing the issue again . 
in a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton leaked to the media last week , French President Jacques Chirac said the matter was of &quot; capital importance . 
but Washington has refused to give way and U.S. officials say they see no likelihood that the Brussels meeting , where the southern command , or AFSOUTH , will be just one of numerous subjects on the agenda , is going to settle the dispute . 
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns , calling it a &quot; very serious disagreement &quot; , said on Wednesday : &quot; I don &apos;t expect that it will be resolved by next week because of the serious differences that exist . 
U.S. leaders say that since the Sixth Fleet is American , the U.S. Congress and people would never accept the command being held by anyone except an American officer -- the current incumbent is Admiral Joseph Lopez . 
the importance of AFSOUTH has increased in recent years since the Soviet threat gave way to new challenges NATO sees coming from across the Mediterranean in the Middle East and North Africa . 
the whole issue of U.S. forces being commanded by foreigners has long been touchy in the United States . 
but Clinton faces the extra problem of a Republican-led Congress suspicious of most U.S. commitments overseas , particularly any where Americans are not fully in charge . 
France argues that times are changing , the Cold War is over , NATO is adjusting to a quite different set of tasks , and the United States itself supports the notion of a stronger European &quot; pillar &quot; within the alliance . 
U.S. officials accept that Chirac too is under political pressure at home . 
France &apos;s opposition Socialists have charged that Chirac has &quot; obtained nothing &quot; in return for the major concession of taking France back into NATO &apos;s military wing . 
the officials say they have made some concessions , including giving greater responsibility to the European deputy to NATO &apos;s American Supreme Allied Commander , Europe ( SACEUR ) . 
diplomats in Paris say the French have also suggested compromises such as putting the Sixth Fleet directly under SACEUR or rotating the Southern Command between an American and a European . 
and Chirac has not recently repeated France &apos;s threat to freeze reintegration into NATO &apos;s military structure if it does not obtain satisfaction on the AFSOUTH issue . 
but U.S. officials say they see little prospect for a speedy compromise . 
a direct and public slap-down of the French demand by Defence Secretary William Perry in September &quot; left very little room &quot; , one said . 
although Italy , Germany and Spain have expressed some support for the French position , U.S. officials say that in general , allied support for Paris is weak . 
one official suggested the most likely outcome was that the AFSOUTH issue would be &quot; kicked down the road &quot; with an agreement that it could be reopened for discussion in three or five years &apos; time . 
&quot; The French are just looking for a way to save face and let things move forward , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What you &apos;ll see is both sides making room for some negotiations to happen , so that discussion on bigger issues can go ahead . 
these issues -- likely to take up much of the time in Brussels -- include the military re-structuring of NATO , relations with Russia , future expansion of the alliance , and the next phase of NATO operations in Bosnia .
