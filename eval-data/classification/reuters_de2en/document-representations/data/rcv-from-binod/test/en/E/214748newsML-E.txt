Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on Monday that Slovakia &apos;s plan to restrict imports on eight food items and commodities next year was a warning signal about the countries &apos; bilateral customs union . 
speaking at a joint news conference with Slovak Economy Minister Karol Cesnek , Dlouhy said the Slovak plan to impose quotas or completely ban imports of selected commodities was against the concept of the customs union forged between the former federation partners in 1993 . 
&quot; I see it as an unfortunate and warning signal , and I am saying that there already is the moment when we have to consider everything .... It is not possible to always back off under pressure , &quot; Dlouhy said . 
the commodities listed by the ministers after a meeting of the Council of the Customs Union , now headed by Cesnek , include margarine , sugar , beer , non-alcoholic drinks , tobacco , spirit and liquers , and potatoes . 
Czechs and Slovaks have been partners in a customs union since the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993 . 
the union allows the imposition of quotas if increasing imports threaten local producers in one of the countries . 
Dlouhy said Czech and Slovak data on bilateral trade differed and a joint committee would meet to unify statistics before the Customs Union council discusses the issue in extraordinary meeting next month . 
Cesnek said agricultural commodities and products were one the most sensitive areas around the world . 
&quot; I believe that with eight items noticed they ( mutual committee ) will finally agree that the statistical data , confirmed by both sides , show that there is some threat ( to local producers ) from one or the other side . 
&quot; he said . 
&quot; If they agree on three or four items , it will also be a success . 
but Dlouhy said he could only find a room to discuss two of the eight items . 
he refused to name them . 
he also declined to comment how would the Czech Republic react to a one-sided measure taken by Slovakia . 
Czech and Slovak officals also failed to agree on mutual recognition of technical certificates necessary for access to the Slovak market , Dlouhy added .
