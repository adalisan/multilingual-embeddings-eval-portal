U.S. debt futures ended mixed with December Treasury bonds lower after mixed economic data and inaction from Federal Reserve policymakers . 
December Treasury bond futures gyrated early after a surprise in October producer price data , slipping on a stronger-than-expected overall figure then spiking to a fresh nine-month high when the focus switched to a drop in the core rate . 
traders said profit-taking quickly cut those gains . 
an hour and a half later , a drop in the Atlanta Federal Reserve business activity index buoyed the long end briefly , before the downside bias returned . 
near midday , December sank through key support at 114-17 / 32 and 114-12 / 32 , attracting technical selling . 
some traders tied a subsequent bounce from the lows to midafternoon comments by U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Jeffrey Shafer reiterating U.S. support for a strong dollar . 
&quot; I think 114-08 / 32 was a very good ( support ) level but I think we would have settled well below 114-20 / 32 without those comments , &quot; a T-bond futures trader said . 
others downplayed the Shafer comments . 
they said two shops simply turned buyers in light volume after the announcement the Fed would stand pat on monetary policy . 
October PPI rose 0.4 percent overall and fell 0.3 percent excluding food and energy . 
wall Street had expected prices to rise 0.2 percent overall and 0.1 percent in the core rate . 
Atlanta Fed &apos;s business activity index fell to minus 9.4 from a revised 3.4 in September . 
traders awaited October consumer prices and retail sales on Thursday . 
CPI is forecast up 0.3 percent overall and up 0.2 percent in the core rate . 
October retail sales are forecast up 0.3 percent overall and in the core rate . 
December T-bonds settled down 6 / 32 at 114-23 / 32 , muni-bonds lost 10 / 32 to 116-27 / 32 , March Eurodollars were flat at 94.46 and December Euros closed steady at 94.49 .
