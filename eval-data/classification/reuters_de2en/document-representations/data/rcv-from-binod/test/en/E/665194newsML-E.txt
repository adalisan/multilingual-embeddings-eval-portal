corporate Japan , which tops the list of direct investors in Hong Kong , expects business as usual after the British colony returns to China at the end of this month . 
but Tokyo will be watching closely to see whether -- and for how long -- Beijing preserves the free-wheeling atmosphere that has made Hong Kong a major magnet for Japanese money . 
&quot; At least in terms of economic ties , there will be no change after the reversion , &quot; said Ryosuke Ikegami of the Japan-China Investment Promotion Organisation . 
&quot; The handover will occur in an instant , but it has been in the works for a decade and if we look at the past few years , there is no reason to expect a change , &quot; Ikegami said . 
Hong Kong , a British colony for more than 150 years , reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 . 
under Sino-British treaties on Hong Kong &apos;s handover , the new Special Administrative Region of China is promised a high degree of self-rule for 50 years after the handover , including fiscal independence and maintenance of a separate currency . 
Japan is currently the leading foreign investor in Hong Kong . 
its non-financial direct investment in Hong Kong totalled $ 1.14 billion in 1995 , or nearly 25 percent of the territory &apos;s total foreign investment , according to Hong Kong official figures . 
economists say that the flow of funds was unlikely to dry up as long as Hong Kong &apos;s economy stayed in good shape . 
unlike some Western firms that were eyeing a move to Singapore to escape Hong Kong &apos;s uncertainties , Japanese companies were not likely to pull up stakes . 
nor does Shanghai look like becoming a viable alternative to Hong Kong as a financial centre any time soon , Japanese analysts said . 
&quot; In terms of infrastructure , availability of information and standard of living , Hong Kong is extremely advanced compared to the rest of China , &quot; said Hiroshi Honkawa , an official at the Japan External Trade Organisation ( JETRO ) . 
&quot; Considering Hong Kong &apos;s base , Japanese firms are not likely to shift their profitable businesses elsewhere . 
behind Japan &apos;s expressions of confidence in Hong Kong &apos;s immediate future was the belief that Beijing would have nothing to gain and everything to lose from undermining Hong Kong &apos;s unique economic role . 
&quot; China would reap no benefits from change , and in fact wants a stronger Hong Kong economy , &quot; Ikegami said . 
Japanese fund managers have said they see little reason to shift their Hong Kong investment strategies in the short-term . 
but some economists cautioned that the colony &apos;s overheated share and property prices could take a tumble post-handover . 
&quot; Hong Kong &apos;s economy has been a sort of a &apos; bubble &apos; this year and there is a lot of speculative money from China flowing into land and shares , &quot; said Takashi Hoshino , an economist at LTCB Research Institute . 
&quot; Chinese speculators have not considered the fact that a market mechanism means prices could fall , and once prices start to decline , there could be panic selling , &quot; he added . 
China &apos;s central bank governor , Dai Xianglong , vowed recently to take further action to cool speculation in China &apos;s own stock markets and punish officials for improper conduct . 
longer-term , Japanese worry that Hong Kong &apos;s integration with China will squeeze the free flow of information and boost official corruption , thus dulling its attraction as a place to do business . 
&quot; Hong Kong has functioned as a gateway to China because it had freedom and convenience not found on the continent , but that freedom will be affected by the handover ... and Hong Kong &apos;s strong points will weaken , &quot; said Tomoo Marukawa , an economist at the Institute of Developing Economies . 
others share those concerns . 
&quot; Hong Kong will become a Chinese city , so it will be run like a Chinese city , and that will change the way the Japanese will be doing business there , &quot; said Kenneth Courtis , chief economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets ( Asia ) . 
&quot; The business environment will be less transparent , the political environment will be more complicated , the security environment will change , and in the rush for money , the physical environment won &apos;t improve , &quot; Courtis said . 
economics aside , Tokyo will be looking to Hong Kong for clues to the future pace of political liberalisation in China . 
&quot; The main issue for Hong Kong &apos;s future is political . 
the extent to which Beijing allows election freedom and parliamentary debate will be a good test case for the future pace of democratisation ( in China ) , &quot; LTCB &apos;s Hoshino said .
