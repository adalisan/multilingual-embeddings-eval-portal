Colombia &apos;s peso dropped 2.8 pesos to an historic low of 1,117.5 against the dollar amid demand for greenbacks from vehicle assemblers coupled with a lack of petro-dollars in the market . 
&quot; The rate was highly volatile and it seemed the peso would fall about 3.7 pesos because there were no petro-dollars in the market and banks were left short , &quot; one dealer said . 
dealers reported 352 trades worth a total $ 173.9 million . 
the peso opened at 1,114 and traded between the intraday high of 1,113.8 and closed at the low . 
Thursday is a bank holiday in Colombia and all financial markets and institutions will be closed .
