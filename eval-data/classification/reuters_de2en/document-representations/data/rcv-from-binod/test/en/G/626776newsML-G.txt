the fate of accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh lay in the hands of 12 jurors on Friday after a federal judge handed them the case and told them not to be swayed by sympathy or public opinion . 
in his final instructions , federal Judge Richard Matsch told the seven men and five women on the jury that they must base their verdict solely on the evidence they heard in court . 
&quot; The law does not permit jurors to be governed by sympathy , prejudice or public opinion . 
you &apos;re expected to carefully and impartially consider all the evidence , follow the law as stated by the court and reach a just verdict , &quot; Matsch told the jurors . 
jurors looked solemn as they were given the responsibility of deciding the guilt or innocence of McVeigh , who is accused of blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19 , 1995 , killing 168 people in the worst mass murder in American history . 
prosecutors painted McVeigh as a right-wing extremist who blew up the Murrah building to spark a &quot; second American revolution &quot; and to avenge the deaths of about 80 Branch Davidian cult members in a confrontation with federal agents at Waco , Texas two years earlier . 
the defence maintains the government has the wrong man and that the real bomber died in the blast . 
McVeigh , a decorated Gulf War veteran , pleaded not guilty to murder and conspiracy but could face the death penalty if convicted . 
jurors , who had been free to go home at nights , were sequestered on Thursday night . 
they will set their own timetable for deliberations and decide if they will meet over the weekend . 
their first task was to appoint a foreman or woman . 
after deliberating for several hours , jurors had lunch brought in , court sources said . 
there was an air of expectancy around the federal Courthouse as lawyers , journalists and relatives of victims settled down to wait for the verdict . 
Matsch told the jury it was irrelevant whether they agreed or disagreed with the far right-wing political opinions the government said McVeigh subscribed to . 
&quot; The defendant is not on trial for any of his thoughts , beliefs or statements which are protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States , &quot; he said . 
McVeigh , usually expressionless , frowned occasionally as he watched the judge read his instructions . 
chief defence attorney Stephen Jones said he spoke with McVeigh after the case went to the jury . 
&quot; He &apos;s feeling good , I don &apos;t think he is nervous , &quot; he told reporters later . 
Matsch appeared to signal to the jury that they should not feel pressured to convict McVeigh because a not guilty verdict might be painted as a defeat for the government . 
if the jurors had a reasonable doubt &quot; you should not hesitate to return a verdict of not guilty , &quot; Matsch said . 
&quot; The question can never be will the government win or lose this case . 
the government always wins when justice is done regardless of whether the verdict is guilty or not guilty . 
Matsch also told the jurors they must scrutinise the testimony of three key prosecution witnesses with great care because they may have had a motive to lie . 
McVeigh &apos;s former army buddy Michael Fortier , who testified that McVeigh told him in advance of his plans to blow up the federal building , reached a plea bargain agreement with the government on bombing-related charges . 
McVeigh &apos;s sister Jennifer and Fortier &apos;s wife Lori both testified against McVeigh under a grant of immunity from prosecution . 
Matsch said the jury should disregard the fact that McVeigh chose not to testify in his own defence . 
McVeigh was charged with conspiracy to detonate a bomb , two bombing charges and eight murder counts for eight federal agents killed in the blast . 
Marsha Kight , whose 23-year-old daughter Frankie Merrell died in the blast , told reporters outside court she had been on an emotional roller-coaster . 
&quot; Right now I have a lot of anxiety , a feeling of powerlessness , &quot; said Kight , one of many victims &apos; relatives who have followed court proceedings . 
the trial has gone much faster than expected , pushed forward by Matsch . 
opening arguments were on April 24 . 
the prosecution called 137 witnesses over 18 days while the defence called 25 witnesses over four days .
