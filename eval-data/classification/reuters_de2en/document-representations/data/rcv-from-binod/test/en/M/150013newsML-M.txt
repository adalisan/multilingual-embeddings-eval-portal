cocoa stocks at Ivory Coast &apos;s main port Abidjan are around the 90,000-tonne mark but exports could be blocked if exporter and freight reference rates are not set soon , say shipping sources . 
&quot; Our figures show 90,000 tonnes but the figure is likely to be higher as some amounts are not notified to us , &quot; said one Abidjan-based shipping source . 
many exporters expect November arrivals to be over 200,000 tonnes and some expect more because of stocks carried over from 1995 / 96 . 
&quot; Based on a 1996 / 97 crop of 950,000 we have estimated about 220,000 for November , &quot; said one Abidjan-exporter . 
October arrivals totalled about 40,000 tonnes , in addition to existing stocks , said others . 
ivory Coast opened its 1996 / 97 cocoa marketing season on October 24 with producer prices unchanged but has not yet granted export licences to 31 companies said to be applying . 
bankers said two or three exporters might not be given licences because of financial problems last year and shipping sources also expect fewer approvals . 
&quot; They will cut out the paper companies , &quot; said an exporter . 
shipping companies say arriving cocoa could be blocked at the port as it was for about six weeks last year when the Caistab marketing agency and shipping companies failed to agree on a reference cocoa export freight rate . 
&quot; For now we will ship at last year &apos;s rate and wait to see what happens , &quot; said one shipping source . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been told to be patient but exporters are having real problems so a similar situation ( to last year ) could develop , &quot; said another . 
shipments last year were blocked from early October to mid-November after shipowners refused to cut freight rates by 25 percent as the government was asking . 
shippers and exporters said they thought the government would be reluctant to request a further cut this year to avoid a repeat of last year &apos;s impasse . 
up-country buyers are also waiting for guidance on the level of commission exporters will pay them for collecting cocoa but say they expect little change from last year &apos;s rate . 
a fire at an Amsterdam warehouse on Saturday destroyed 11,000 tonnes of mainly Ivorian-origin cocoa .
