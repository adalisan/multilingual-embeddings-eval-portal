* Hermis Bank edges down to 189.00 litas from 190.00 litas . 
* Lithuanian Sea Shipping sinks to 6.00 litas from 6.15 litas . 
* Klaipeda stevedoring declines to 12.30 litas from 12.50 litas . 
* brokers say summer holidays are keeping down share prices and trading activity . 
brokers said Lithuania &apos;s stock exchange was listless after early trading Monday and that losses were likely . 
&quot; It &apos;s too hot to work today and all the brokers are not are resting at the seaside instead , &quot; said one of the few brokers apparently at work . 
&quot; I expect lower prices today and not a high level of turnover . 
official list shares looked mixed and inactive on the central market . 
Hermis Bank declined to 189.00 litas from 190.00 litas , but brokers said its central market turnover would be low and expected block trades to account for most of its activity . 
Vilniaus Bank jumped to a tentative 240.00 litas from 230.00 litas but found no buyers at the price and was expected to end where it did Friday , brokers said . 
Birzhu Milk held steady at 9.20 litas , and Medienos Plaushas was unchanged at 12.00 litas . 
the price for Rokishkis cheese was not determined in morning trade . 
brokers said it had been pushed too high on Friday amid low volume and was correcting itself today . 
but brokers still see loads of potential in KLASCO and expect its price to increase gradually throughout the summer . 
Lithuanian Sea Shipping Company ( Lisco ) sunk to 6.00 litas from 6.15 litas , which brokers blamed on one big order to sell at 6.00 litas . 
declines in Lisco and KLASCO were expected to drag down the rest of group A if Lithuanian Gas , the price for which was not set in the early session , traded steady or down . 
Lithuanian Gas , which brokers say is filled with long-term potential , weighs heavily on the list A index .
