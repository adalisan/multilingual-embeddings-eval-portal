children from a Venezuelan school took their desks and books into the street Thursday to join teachers in protest over pay and conditions . 
about 70 children ranging in ages from eight to 17 settled down to class on a busy highway in western Caracas as cars squeezed past and bemused policeman looked on . 
&quot; We are carrying out classes in the street because the ministry has not paid us , &quot; Raiza Sira , a teacher at the Miguel Antonio Caro school told Reuters . 
the children clapped and chanted their support for the teachers . 
&quot; It &apos;s not fair that they don &apos;t pay the teachers , &quot; said Adriana , aged 11 . 
teachers and students complained that the school , located in one of the capital &apos;s poorer neighbourhoods , had been plagued by thefts of equipment and even books . 
President Rafael Caldera &apos;s government is facing a number of protests from public sector workers as the effects of a deep economic crisis begin to bite . 
teachers in Venezuela earn less than $ 100 per month .
