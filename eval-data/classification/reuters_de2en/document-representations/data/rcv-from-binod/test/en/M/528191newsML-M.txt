North American bunker prices were steady to higher , with most of the movement taking place on the West Coast , traders said . 
&quot; Los Angeles in higher because there are no cargoes , and Seattle is higher because it &apos;s the start of the cruise season and the asphalt season , &quot; said one West Coast trader . 
he noted cruise ships stoke up bunker demand , while asphalt is a material that comes from a similar part of the crude barrel -- namely the bottom . 
in Houston prices were steady , while in New York prices were steady to softer . 
deals for 380 CST were getting priced in Los Angeles about $ 3 firmer than late last week at between $ 96 and $ 98 a tonne , with 180 CST material up by $ 2 to between $ 100 / $ 103 a tonne . 
in Seattle , 380 CST was priced $ 4 higher at between $ 92 and $ 94 a tonne , with 180 CST fuel rising by the same amount to between $ 96 and $ 98 a tonne . 
in Houston prices of 380 CST still stood at between $ 93 and $ 95 a tonne , and 180 CST was still at between $ 96 and $ 98 a tonne . 
in New York , 380 CST came off last week &apos;s levels by $ 3 to about $ 100 a tonne .
