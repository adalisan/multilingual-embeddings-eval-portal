Brazil &apos;s real rose 0.02 percent to close at 1.0185 against the dollar in the commercial foreign exchange market in the first calm trading day this week , dealers said . 
&quot; apparently some banks decided to sell dollars to the market and this move avoided a fall in the real currency despite continued dollar outflows , &quot; one trader said . 
preliminary figures for commercial and financial foreign exchange contracts showed a Wednesday deficit of $ 42 million in the late afternoon . 
in the last four sessions , dollar flows showed three days of deficit , dealers said . 
they also said the market expects more outflows this week due to continuing payments on maturing Eurobonds . 
on the other hand , dealers are expecting dollar inflows in the second half of the month due to recent Eurobonds issues . 
in the interbank forex floating rate market , the real closed at 1.0230 to the dollar , up 0.01 percent . 
in the illegal parallel market , the real fell 0.1 percent to end at 1.030 per greenback , traders said .
