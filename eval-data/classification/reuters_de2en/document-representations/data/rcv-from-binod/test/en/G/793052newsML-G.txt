English premier league runners-up Newcastle face an awkward European Cup preliminary round first leg clash against Croatia Zagreb on Wednesday and will look for a healthy lead to take to the away leg in two weeks . 
victory in the tie earns a place in the Champions &apos; League and while the board will have an eye on the probable five million pounds ( $ 7.9 million ) income that competition provides , manager Kenny Dalglish will be more interested in pitting his side against the cream of the continent . 
but as a vastly experienced European campaigner , Dalglish will not be looking beyond Wednesday &apos;s first leg at St James &apos; Park when his team face what he describes as &quot; a formidable challenge &quot; . 
the Croatian champions beat Partizan Belgrade 5-1 on aggregate in the first preliminary round and have followed up by winning their first two league fixtures , the latest a 6-2 away victory at Varteks . 
Newcastle also started well , beating Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 in their opening league game on Saturday and , even without last season &apos;s strike force of Alan Shearer and Les Ferdinand , Dalglish is in confident mood . 
&quot; They are a good side and will be very difficult opponents , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But our game is now more suited to success in Europe . 
if you go around European countries it seems a common fact they now have a greater respect for English teams than before . 
Dalglish , who has had Zagreb watched a couple of times this season , added : &quot; We know enough about them and the atmosphere in Zagreb will be rather hostile . 
but at the end of the day it is how we perform which will decide whether we go through . 
Zagreb are likely to be at full strength while Newcastle full back Warren Barton who is suspended . 
probable teams : 
Newcastle ( from ) - Shay Given or Pavel Srnicek , Steve Watson , John Beresford , Stuart Pearce , Alessandro Pistone , Philippe Albert , Robert Lee , Temuri Ketsbaia , Dahl Tomasson , David batty , Peter Beardsley , Faustino Asprilla , Keith Gillespie . 
Zagreb - Drazen Ladic , Goran Juric , Dario Simic , Kresimir Jurcic or Stjepan Tomas , Danijel Saric , Damir Krznar , Silvio Maric , Robert Prosinecki , Mark Viduka , Edin Mujcin , Igor Cvitanovic .
