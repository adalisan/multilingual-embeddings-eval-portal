even the traditional fiscal year end spending spree by government departments in March will not jeopardize Britain &apos;s 26.4 billion stg deficit forecast for fiscal 1996-97 , analysts said on Tuesday . 
&quot; barring a total disaster in March , the PBSR ( Public Sector borrowing Requirement ) is set to undershoot by at least several billion sterling this year , &quot; said Jonathon Loynes , UK economist at HSBC Markets . 
the country posted a 3.58 billion sterling shortfall in March , slightly below market expectations of 3.7 billion . 
the figure brought the cumulative 11-month deficit to 14.09 billion sterling , down significantly from 22.22 billion during the same period last year . 
&quot; We stick to our ( full-year ) forecast of 23 billion but an even lower number is perfectly possible , &quot; said Loynes . 
the increasing likelihood of a deficit undershoot placed public finances on more solid footing for the 1997 / 98 fiscal year in which the Treasury has forecast a shortfall of 19.2 billion sterling , analysts said . 
&quot; The official forecast looks achievable even allowing for some slowdown in the economy on the back of the strong pound . 
the new government may need to do less on fiscal policy than is currently assumed , &quot; said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy . 
the restrained PBSR showed the government had not attempted to boost spending in the run-up to the country &apos;s May 1 general election . 
&quot; Coming up to last election there was a definite upward trend so I &apos;ve got to hand it to them , they &apos;ve really kept spending under control , &quot; said John O &apos;Sullivan , UK economist at NatWest . 
&quot; Given it &apos;s an election year , that &apos;s an exceptional performance . 
the past two years have shown a double-digit deficit in March , the country &apos;s fiscal year end , as government departments scramble to spend the remainder of their budgets out of fear of losing funding the next year if they do not . 
&quot; You always get a big monthly deficit in March , but there should be no adverse factor that isn &apos;t there in previous years , &quot; said Michael Saunders , UK economist at Salomon Brothers , who forecast a full-year figure between 23 and 24 billion sterling . 
tax receipts in Britain continued to grow more rapidly than spending and , excluding privatisation proceeds , public finances improved by some 700 million sterling over last year . 
the introduction of self assessment for the self employed helped boost income tax receipts , which jumped from 4.9 billion to 6.3 billion sterling . 
both local authorities and public corporations showed sizeable surpluses of 727 million and 875 million sterling in February respectively . 
value added tax ( VAT ) receipts fell to 3.77 billion sterling in February from 5.23 billion the month before , although January was a particularly buoyant month , analysts said .
