a Council of Europe delegation monitoring Sunday &apos;s Albanian local polls said on Friday it deplored the absence of some observers after a dispute with the government over supervision of the vote . 
in a related development , Albania &apos;s opposition Socialist Party alleged irregularities in the voters &apos; register but said it was confident of winning if the vote was free and fair . 
the Council of Europe said in a statement : &quot; The Council of Europe ... deplores that because of a dispute over the number of its observers , the OSCE has been deprived of the opportunity to contribute to the monitoring . 
the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) scrapped plans to send two teams of observers after Albania rejected part of a list from its main monitoring body , the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) . 
delegation head Victor Ruffy , a Swiss socialist , said the Council of Europe had done its utmost to ensure the OSCE &apos;s participation . 
Albania &apos;s opposition has called the government &apos;s refusal to allow in the entire ODIHR team &quot; an act of primitive revenge &quot; . 
Ruffy said the presence of some 500 international observers should nevertheless help to secure free and fair elections . 
Albania &apos;s Socialist secretary general Rexhep Mejdani said the electoral register was artificially swollen . 
&quot; We are concerned by additions in voters &apos; lists which reach 10-15 percent in the main cities where the Democratic Party governs , &quot; he told a news conference . 
&quot; If the elections are free and fair the opposition will win . 
he said the Socialists had no intention of repeating their boycott of general elections in May and June . 
&quot; The Socialist Party &apos;s aim was and remains the participation in these elections , securing free and fair voting . 
some 2.2 million Albanians are eligible to vote in the elections for councils at town , district and communal level . 
the toughest fight is expected in Tirana , held by the Democrats for the past four years , where all parties have put forward heavyweight candidates . 
the Socialist Party and other opposition parties pulled out of Albania &apos;s general elections earlier this year accusing the ruling Democrats of rigging the poll and intimidating voters -- allegations supported by some independent observers . 
the United States and the European Union have sent a clear signal to Tirana that they will be watching the local polls closely this weekend as a test of Albania &apos;s democracy .
