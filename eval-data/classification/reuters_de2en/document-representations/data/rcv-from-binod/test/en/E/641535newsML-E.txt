Britain &apos;s interest rates are expected to rise 25 basis points after this week &apos;s inaugural meeting of the Bank of England &apos;s monetary policy committee , a Reuters survey showed . 
in the survey , carried out on Tuesday , 12 out of 21 contributors said they expected base rates to rise to 6.50 percent from 6.25 percent after the committee meeting on Thursday and Friday . 
nine of those surveyed said they expected no change in base rates when the outcome of the meeting is announced on Friday . 
&quot; The economic fundamentals say we should see a tightening . 
consumer spending is accelerating further and there seems to be a weakening of consumer resistance to price increases , &quot; said Keith Davies , UK economist at analysis company 4CAST . 
balanced against that , recent inflation indicators may justify holding monetary policy steady and higher base rates would probably push the rampant pound higher still , squeezing Britain &apos;s exporters further . 
in early May , sterling climbed to 2.8330 marks , the highest level since September 1992 and retail prices excluding mortgage payments met the government &apos;s 2.5 percent target in April . 
&quot; The committee will want to give the government the benefit of the doubt and see what the budget ( due July 2 ) looks like . 
if it &apos;s a loose budget , rates may have to go up by 50 basis points in July , &quot; said Jeremy Hawkins , chief economist at Bank of America . 
many analysts expect Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown to tighten fiscal policy in his budget next month . 
&quot; We do expect fiscal policy to be tightened which should offset some of the need for an aggressive tightening in monetary policy , &quot; said Edmund Nonis , UK economist at Nikko Europe . 
one of the first acts of the new Labour government was to give the Bank of England operational independence to set interest rates . 
it replaced the old system of monthly meetings between the Governor of the Bank of England ( BoE ) Eddie George and previous Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke . 
the monetary council , appointed by the government , comprises five BoE members and four academic and practising economists . 
but for this week &apos;s meeting only two of the academics will be present alongside four Bank members . 
all 21 contributors forecast base rates at or above the current 6.25 percent level by end-1997 . 
twelve expect base rates at seven percent and seven see 6.75 percent by the end of this year . 
&quot; Higher personal taxes may not be enough to dampen economic growth or consumer spending boosted by windfall gains from building society flotations , &quot; said one contributor . 
Halifax plc , Britain &apos;s largest mortgage lender , converted into a bank on Monday and showered millions of members with more than 17 billion pounds in shares in the process . 
a total of nearly 30 billion pounds from various converting building societies will be shelled out over the summer to consumers who already show little reluctance to spend . 
one respondent forecast base rates at 6.25 percent by end-1997 and another sees 6.50 percent . 
but most analysts said it would take persistent sterling strength and a particularly tight budget to prevent rates heading higher .
