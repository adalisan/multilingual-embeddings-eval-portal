Juergen Klinsmann heads back to the ground where he made his name on Sunday , knowing Bayern Munich must destroy the most powerful goal machine in the country to overcome VfB Stuttgart in Germany &apos;s crunch league clash . 
Stuttgart &apos;s talented Brazilian Giovane Elber and Euro 96 striker Fredi Bobic have both scored 10 goals each in 15 games this season , just one behind the Bundesliga &apos;s top scorer Sean Dundee of Karlsruhe . 
together with Bulgarian Krasimir Balakov , who plays just behind the strikers and has seven goals to his name , the trio are known as Stuttgart &apos;s &quot; magic triangle . 
Bayern &apos;s experienced defence will need to work overtime if the leaders are to repeat their two victories in Stuttgart in the past two seasons . 
&quot; If you have those three under control , the magic triangle might turn into a tragic triangle , &quot; said Thomas Strunz , Bayern &apos;s former Stuttgart midfielder . 
&quot; The magic thing about our team is that we are playing badly but are still on top of the table . 
Strunz has a point about Bayern &apos;s form . 
chairman Franz Beckenbauer has told the team they will need to up their game in the second half of the season if they want to win a record 14th championship . 
but in the last two games before the Bundesliga &apos;s winter break , points matter most . 
Bayern have a two-point lead over Stuttgart at the top and are determined to go into the two-month break on top . 
often in the past the team which leads at the halfway stage has gone on to win the championship . 
Klinsmann , just one short of 100 Bundesliga goals , has been far from his best in domestic action this season , scoring just four goals . 
but he is still Bayern &apos;s top scorer . 
one of the main differences between the two teams is that more Bayern players have taken responsibility for scoring the goals this season . 
former Tottenham striker Klinsmann , who scored the crucial goal in Bayern &apos;s 1-0 win in Stuttgart last season , will be extra motivated to perform in his home city where he made his name in the late 1980s before heading to Internazionale Milan , Monaco , and then England . 
he is one of three key players who have played for both clubs . 
German international Strunz came from Stuttgart last year and VfB &apos;s 1990 World Cup-winning defender Thomas Berthold also used to play for Bayern . 
&quot; Juergen is going to be especially motivated here in Stuttgart and that is going to make him so dangerous , &quot; Berthold said . 
the two teams first met in 1914 in a friendly when Stuttgart won 4-1 . 
but Bayern &apos;s record against their south German rivals has been excellent since the Bundesliga was set up in 1963 . 
Bayern have won 16 times in Stuttgart compared to seven wins for the home team , the last back in 1991 . 
Stuttgart have struggled to make an impact in the Bundesliga since they last won the championship in 1992 . 
but statistics mean nothing to this particular VfB side who have been impressive at home with 22 goals in seven games in the Gottlieb-Daimler stadium this season . 
&quot; We don &apos;t need to hide against Bayern , &quot; Elber said . 
&quot; We can beat them .
