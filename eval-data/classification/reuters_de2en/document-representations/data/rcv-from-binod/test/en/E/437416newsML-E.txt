British manufacturing output rose a modest 0.3 percent in January , official figures showed on Tuesday , confirming that the sector is the weakest part of the economy . 
the Office for National Statisics said manufacturing output was 1.6 percent higher than a year ago but with annual consumer spending growth running at about four percent it is clearly still lagging . 
the Treasury said manufacturing industry continued to expand but economists said it was not growing fast enough to require a near-term rise in interest rates . 
industrial production , which includes output from the energy industries , was flat in January but the ons said milder weather cut demand for gas and electricity . 
gas and electricity output fell 1.6 percent in January as the nation turned its heating down after December &apos;s cold spell petered out . 
&quot; The surprise has been the extent to which manufacturing has lagged domestic demand , &quot; said John Shepperd , chief economist at Yamaichi International . 
&quot; But with the strength of sterling , it is difficult to imagine output really taking off . 
we are probably in for more of the same in the next few months . 
the pound , which has shot up nearly 17 percent against a basket of major currencies in the last in eight months , has squeezed manufacturing exporters by pushing their prices higher . 
but economists said there were few signs in Tuesday &apos;s figures that exporters were suffering too badly so far . 
that damage could be yet to come . 
&quot; We are likely to see the strong exchange rate have a more significant effect on the official output data in coming months , &quot; said Darshini David , UK economist at HSBC Markets . 
&quot; For manufacturers , the worst may be yet to come . 
there are pockets of real strength in British industry . 
the ons said output rose in just over half of Britain &apos;s manufacturing industries in the latest three months . 
output of cars jumped by 3.4 percent over the three months to January while food , drink and tobacco production also edged higher . 
but that was more than offset by a 2.7 percent fall in clothing and footwear output . 
David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy , said the fall in textiles and clothing output suggested the pace of high street spending was slowing . 
&quot; These figures are unlikely to add much to the debate on UK interest rates , &quot; he said . 
that means Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke will have no problem leaving base rates at six percent until elections , which are expected to be held on May 1 . 
with two thirds of British homes owned rather than rented , a pre-election base rate rise which would force home loan costs higher is politically out of the question . 
after the election rates will rise . 
at the start of the year markets expected base rates to hit seven percent by the end of 1997 , with high street spending easing off a little and manufacturing growth only modest . 
but 6.5 percent was now more likely , Shepperd said . 
&quot; The argument has changed . 
whoever wins the election will raise interest rates but by less than was previously feared , &quot; he said . 
with the opposition Labour Party holding a 20 percentage point lead over the ruling Conservatives in opinion polls , that is more likely to be shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown &apos;s problem than Kenneth Clarke &apos;s .
