a three-week U.S. effort to broker an Israeli pullout from the occupied West Bank town of Hebron collapsed on Monday with Palestinians and Israelis each blaming the other for the deadlock . 
U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross said he was heading home , having failed in another all-night effort to get Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to agree . 
&quot; Over the past three weeks we have made substantial progress , &quot; Ross said in a statement . 
but his bottom line was : &quot; differences remain &quot; . 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat left on a three-day European tour . 
&quot; In view of the fact that Chairman Arafat is departing today for scheduled stops in Europe , I am returning to Washington for consultations , &quot; Ross said . 
the impasse raised fears of fresh violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , a month after unprecedented gun battles claimed the lives of 60 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers . 
a 10-year-old Palestinian boy died in hospital on Monday after being beaten in the West Bank by a Jewish settler who suspected he had thrown stones at Israeli cars , the boy &apos;s father said . 
in Hebron , where 400 Jews live in heavily guarded compounds amid 100,000 Palestinians , Jewish settlers opened fire near Palestinians on Sunday after their vehicle was pelted with stones . 
Israelis and Palestinians have logged scores of negotiating hours this month trying to come to terms on the Hebron withdrawal , which Israel committed to more than a year ago . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton urged both Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in separate telephone calls on Sunday to seal the deal . 
Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to dictate new terms for the redeployment in Hebron , the last of seven towns the Jewish state agreed to hand over to Palestinian self-rule under a deal signed by the previous Labour government . 
the troop redeployment has been delayed since March . 
&quot; The thing that &apos;s causing the delay at this moment is the absence of a decision or the absence of an order from the highest level on the Palestinian side for the delegation to complete this thing , &quot; Netanyahu told reporters on Monday . 
he said the deal could have been done days ago . 
&quot; We &apos;re mad at Arafat . 
he &apos;s apparently trying to stall , &quot; said Netanyahu &apos;s spokesman Shai Bazak . 
other Israeli officials said Arafat thought he might get a better deal after U.S. elections on November 5 . 
&quot; We are not thinking much about whether the agreement will be reached before the elections or after them . 
we want an agreement now , &quot; countered Palestinian negotiator Nabil Amr . 
&quot; When we reach answers to the questions on the table , we will sign the agreement whether it is tonight or after several days , &quot; Amr told Israel Radio . 
Netanyahu , who ousted Labour in national elections last May , has said adjustments are necessary to safeguard the 400 Jews in Hebron . 
Palestinians said the differences centred on Israel &apos;s demand for the right to pursue Palestinian militants into parts of Hebron it hands over to the PLO and what arms Palestinian police would be allowed to carry .
