the famed Three tenors will hold their final performance ever in the Houston Astrodome on March 16 , a spokeswoman said on Wednesday . 
the Houston concert will end a world tour that began earlier this year , and also close the book on what has been a hugely successful joint effort by tenors Luciano Pavarotti , Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras . 
the three singers began performing together in 1990 in conjunction with the World Cup in Italy , then followed that up with a 1994 concert in Los Angeles , and the current world tour . 
but they have said it is time for them to go their separate ways . 
&quot; This is the last and final performance ever . 
ever , &quot; said spokeswoman Leslie Sonnenklar . 
the Astrodome , which was the world &apos;s first domed stadium when it opened in 1965 , can be configured to seat around 60,000 fans for a musical event . 
Sonnenklar said Houston was likely chosen because of its relatively central location in North America , with the expectation that the concert would attract fans from Latin America as well as the United States , Canada and Europe . 
the Three tenors were to hold a news conference via satellite on Thursday in the Astrodome , Sonnenklar said .
