Russia &apos;s rebel Chechen region voted amid the ruins of a two-year war on Monday for a leader to press the battle for worldwide recognition and independence from Moscow . 
in Moscow , hardliners who have described rebel chiefs as bandits , poured scorn on the former guerrilla leaders &apos; new role as presidential candidates . 
&quot; Birds of a feather , &quot; said Viktor Ilyukhin , a communist who heads the parliamentary security committee . 
&quot; There can be no free elections in Chechnya . 
election officials described the turnout as heavy in both the devastated regional capital Grozny and in rural areas on a cold and clear winter &apos;s day . 
in some places more than 100 voters queued up , pushing and shoving towards voting booths . 
some wore traditional sheepskin hats but few people on the streets brandished guns , even though the region is still awash with weapons . 
&quot; We need an end to chaos and these elections will put us on the road to a better life , &quot; said Musa Sagalayev , 45 , after casting his ballot in Grozny , within sight of the towering Caucasus mountains . 
only five months ago , Russian forces suffered humiliating defeat in the streets of Grozny at rebel hands , forcing peace talks and a swift withdrawal of Moscow &apos;s troops . 
now President Boris Yeltsin , ailing after heart surgery and pneumonia , must watch from afar as his tormentors vie for power . 
Aslan Maskhadov , commander of the small guerrilla army in a war that killed thousands , is the clear frontrunner . 
straw polls last week suggested Maskhadov , a 45-year-old former Soviet army colonel , could win outright with more than 50 percent of the vote . 
if no candidate wins outright , a run-off will be held in two weeks . 
casting his ballot at an old dairy collective farm 20 km ( 12 miles ) northwest of Grozny , Maskhadov predicted he would win 60 percent of the vote . 
he pledged to &quot; bring order &quot; to Chechnya as his first step and to develop normal ties with Russia . 
&quot; We need to develop normal ties so that we won &apos;t have to wage war any more , &quot; said the grey-haired commander , dressed in a traditional lambswool hat . 
his main rivals are acting President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev , field commander Shamil Basayev and rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov . 
Maskhadov is thought to be Moscow &apos;s preferred choice . 
Basayev , 32 , who made his name with a bloody raid on the southern Russian town of Budennovsk in 1995 , is a wanted man in Russia and his election would be a nightmare for the Kremlin . 
casting his vote in the snow-clad mountain village of Vedeno , Basayev forecast his own victory and warned Russia it would &quot; collapse &quot; if it failed to accept Chechen independence . 
he also said that , win or lose , he hoped for good relations with the other separatist leaders -- a sign that tensions stoked up during the election campaign may be easing now . 
seventy-two international observers were watching voting on behalf of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
some said they were surprised by the high turnout and the smooth way the poll was proceeding . 
&quot; It is obvious that they ( the Chechens ) want to show Russia and the whole world that they are capable of organising democratic elections , &quot; said one Scandinavian observer . 
Chechen leaders , worried that violence could disrupt the voting , have taken extensive security measures . 
all the main candidates pledge to turn the de facto autonomy secured by last month &apos;s withdrawal of Russian troops into full sovereignty . 
but the Kremlin , fearing instability and unrest among other minorities , has ruled out secession . 
Maskhadov says he is determined to seek reparations from Moscow . 
Yeltsin , who says the military campaign was a mistake , has promised aid after the elections . 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Saturday he would work with any elected leader . 
Yeltsin agreed to elections as part of a peace deal last August which deferred solving the dispute over Chechnya &apos;s political status for five years . 
Maskhadov and the other main contenders now say they will not delay negotiations any longer . 
as many as 60,000 refugees outside Chechnya are expected to vote at polling stations set up near the borders . 
polls were due to close at 8 p.m. ( 1700 GMT ) and first results were expected as early as Monday night . 
some 850 candidates are also standing for 63 local assembly seats .
