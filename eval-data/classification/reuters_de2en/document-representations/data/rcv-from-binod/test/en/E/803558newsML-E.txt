Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Friday the government wanted to reform the tax system now partly because of the country &apos;s currently low inflation rate . 
&quot; One of the reasons why we are embarking on it at the present time is that when you have a very low rate of inflation it is an extremely good time to be examining fundamental changes to the tax system , &quot; Howard told a meeting of pensioners . 
Howard promised the pensioners that any tax changes would consider the position of people on fixed incomes . 
Howard announced on Wednesday his government would draft a tax reform package over the next few months , aimed at a new broad-based indirect tax and cutting income taxes . 
the move is widely seen as leading to a goods and services tax -- a tax on consumption -- which many economists believe would have an initial impact on inflation . 
the consumer price index inflation measure fell 0.2 percent in the June quarter for an annual inflation rate of 0.3 percent .
