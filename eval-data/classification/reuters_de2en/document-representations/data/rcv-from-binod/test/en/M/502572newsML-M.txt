SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures pared gains late on Friday after the yen retreated from initial highs , dealers said . 
a slew of pro-yen comments from Japanese and U.S. officials helped Euroyen futures breach important resistance levels . 
&quot; supportive comments from government officials led the yen higher , &quot; a U.S. commission house dealer said . 
but the early speculative sales of dollars cooled , resulting in a pullback in the yen , which spilled into euroyen and JGB &apos;s . 
June JGBs settled at 126.66 against their open at 127.00 , on a low volume of 207 . 
dealers said conflicting comments by key finance officials , and concern central banks may intervene in the market , acted to keep the market nervous and mostly sidelined . 
&quot; Interest rate markets and currency futures are very nervous at this time . 
it &apos;s the speed at which the dollar is rising , &quot; a European commission house dealer said . 
Eurodollar futures drifted sideways in lacklustre conditions awaiting U.S. inflation data on Friday , which could sway the current outlook for higher interest rates . 
U.S. Producer Price Index ( PPI ) and retail sales data for March will both be released on Friday . 
analysts expect little surprise from the PPI figures but a poll in the U.S. by Reuters forecast retail sales to have risen 0.6 percent in March and 0.4 percent , excluding car sales . 
dealers said strong economic growth pointed to a further hike in interest rates by 25 basis points at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on May 20 . 
September Eurodollars ended at 93.730 against their IMM close at 93.73 on moderate volume of 7300 lots .
