housewife Avril Soman won Britain &apos;s oldest pancake race on Tuesday , setting a time she hopes will be fast enough to see off American rivals running in a similar contest across the Atlantic . 
the small town of Olney in Buckinghamshire , central England , has held the Shrove Tuesday foot race off and on since 1445 . 
last year it was held in a blizzard despite police advice that it should be called off on safety grounds . 
&quot; It &apos;s a tradition that goes on come hell or high water , &quot; said Reverend Nigel Pond , who was at the finishing line outside St Peter and St Paul &apos;s Church . 
on the same day in the town of Liberal , Kansas , competitors line up to contest a similar race and then compare times with Olney . 
so far the series is tied at 23 wins each . 
pond said Soman won in 63.50 seconds , a fast time which he hopes the Americans will be unable to beat . 
&quot; This year we were very fortunate because the weather was very good , with only a light wind , &quot; he told Reuters . 
fourteen people competed in the race , including Olney &apos;s mayor Deirdre Bethune . 
competitors must be aged 18 or over and residents of Olney . 
the race tends to be dominated by women because of the strict dress code -- runners must wear shirts , aprons and headscarves -- and they have to be able to whip up a pancake which can be tossed at the beginning and end of the race . 
pond said : &quot; They don &apos;t need to eat the pancake at the end which is a bit of luck considering the number of times they fall in the dirt . 
pancakes are traditionally eaten on Shrove Tuesday , the last day before the Lent pre-Easter fast .
