Hungary &apos;s overnight interest rates broke the declining trend of the past week on Wednesday and closed unchanged from Tuesday with banks filling their reserves before the end of the reserve period , dealers said . 
most deals were struck at about 21.25 percent and the market closed at some 21 percent . 
&quot; These levels were unchanged compared with yesterday , &quot; Budapest Bank &apos;s Sandor Tolonics said . 
&quot; The approaching end of the reserve period ( on Friday ) made some banks careful . 
dealers said some large players took up money to fill their reserves . 
lenders , including large ones , also appeared on the market at Tuesday &apos;s interest rate levels and turnover was high , dealers added . 
Tolonics said Wednesday &apos;s high levels , which surprised most dealers as they had expected the rates to drop , could have been an intermezzo . 
the banks &apos; reserves are probably full and the declining trend is likely to continue , he added . 
dealers said the overnight rates could go down to 18 percent by Friday .
