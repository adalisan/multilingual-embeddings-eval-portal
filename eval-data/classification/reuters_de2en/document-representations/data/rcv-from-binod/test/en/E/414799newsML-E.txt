Alabama Gov. 
fob James plans to release his $ 700 million highway bond proposal by the end of this week , spokeswoman Sandra Nesbitt said Monday . 
James has been discussing the plan for several months but has not released final details . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 700 million , &quot; Nesbitt said . 
the plan would use existing gasoline taxes to pay debt service on the bonds , which would finance construction of bypasses around north Birmingham and south Montgomery and expand several busy highways to four lanes . 
the debt would jump-start major projects that James said are badly needed but could not be started for several years if Alabama relies on pay-as-you-go funding . 
Nesbitt said the proposal would be finished and submitted to the legislature in bill form by Friday .
