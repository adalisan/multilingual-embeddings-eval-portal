Algeria &apos;s Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said on Sunday that the country &apos;s foreign currency reserves stood at $ 4 billion at the end of 1996 . 
Ouyahia was quoted by Algerian state-run radio as addressing the government-appointed Social and Economic National Council ( CNES ) . 
he said the figure was an indication of Algeria &apos;s sound financial situation which would enable it to avoid seeking a third rescheduling for its foreign debt of more than $ 30 billion . 
the foreign currency reserves level for 1996 is a record . 
the previous high was in 1981 when Algeria piled up about $ 3.5 billion , thanks to exceptional crude oil prices because of the Gulf War between Iran and Iraq . 
this year &apos;s currency reserves were double Algeria &apos;s reserves of $ 2 billion in 1995 , said the radio , quoting Ouyahia . 
the government had said that Algerian oil prices hovered around an average of more than $ 20 per barrel this year compared to a targeted $ 17.90 per barrel in the government budget for 1996 .
