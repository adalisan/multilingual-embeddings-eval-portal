storms dumped a foot of rain in parts of Kentucky and 5 inches in Ohio , taking nine lives and forcing evacuations in both states as rivers and creeks boiled out of their banks , officials said Sunday . 
the Kentucky Division of Disaster and Emergency Services said the bodies of some of the seven victims , all of whom died by drowning , had not been recovered . 
floods in Ohio killed at least two people and drove hundreds from their homes . 
the Kentucky deaths included a couple whose car was swept off a highway and a 13-year-old boy sucked into a culvert he and his father were trying to clear of debris at the end of their driveway . 
one of the dead in Ohio was a 16-year-old boy who drowned in a culvert near Blue creek , Ohio , about 50 miles east of Cincinnati , an Adams County emergency services spokesman said . 
he also said a woman had drowned in the county . 
thirty-six Kentucky counties and 35 cities declared emergencies . 
Paul Patton deployed 200 National Guard troops to help with evacuations and 19 Guard armories were opened as emergency shelters . 
twelve inches of rain fell in Louisville and other parts of Kentucky from late Friday night through Sunday morning . 
the total included 9.6 inches over a 24-hour period , the most ever recorded in one day in the city . 
the torrential rain caused the Ohio River to rise 19 feet in 24 hours to a flood stage of 52 feet in Cincinnati Sunday . 
the U.S. 
weather Service said the river would crest at 57.5 feet Tuesday . 
an interstate highway in Louisville was closed for a time and parts of other interstates elsewhere in the state remained closed Sunday , along with many other streets and secondary highways .
