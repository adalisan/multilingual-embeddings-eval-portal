Canadian manufacturers plan , on balance , to increase output in the coming three months , Statistics Canada said on Monday . 
a survey of 5,000 manufacturers recorded mainly in the first two weeks of January indicated that they have overcome the uncertainty relating to last fall &apos;s Labor disputes in the automotive industry , the federal agency said . 
it said the balance of opinion rose 36 points to + 27 . 
that was arrived at by subtracting the 10 percent of manufacturers who foresaw lower output from the 37 percent who planned higher production . 
the balance of opinion concerning the backlog of unfilled orders was at + 2 , up from -4 posted in the October 1996 survey . 
the balance has not been positive since the + 8 posted in January 1995 . 
opinion on current levels of orders received rose 14 points to + 21 . 
this was a substantial improvement from the negative balances recorded in the four surveys up to and including April 1996 . 
the number of manufacturers who felt their level of finished product inventories was too high decreased to 13 percent from 17 percent in October and a recent peak of 31 percent in April 1996 . 
the number feeling their inventories were about right rose three points to 82 percent . 
fourteen percent planned higher employment in the next three months , 14 percent lower and 72 percent unchanged . 
three percent of manufacturers felt a shortage of skilled Labor , down from four percent . 
two percent had a shortage of working capital , and three percent saw shortages of raw materials .
