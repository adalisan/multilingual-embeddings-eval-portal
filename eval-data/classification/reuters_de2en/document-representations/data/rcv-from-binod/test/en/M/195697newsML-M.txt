the Zimbabwe dollar closed on Monday mixed against hard currencies after a lacklustre interbank session , foreign exchange dealers said . 
&quot; Nothing much happened today . 
there was very little trade and there were no large payments made that we know of , &quot; one dealer said . 
he and others agreed that the market , mainly driven by forces of supply and demand , was still turning a blind eye on a four-week-old strike by junior doctors and nurses demanding higher salaries and improved working conditions , which has crippled the country &apos;s health system . 
the local unit closed on Monday at 10.6750 / 6950 against the U.S. dollar , unchanged from Friday , but was weaker on pound sterling at 17.7950 / 8390 compared to 17.7900 / 8100 . 
it was also softer on the South African rand at 2.2880 / 2950 from 2.2800 / 3000 but edged up against the mark to 7.0890 / 1025 from last Friday &apos;s 7.0900 / 1100 .
