the Mexican peso recouped some ground lost earlier against the dollar at the close of trade on Thursday as speculation and dollar short-covering eased , traders said . 
&quot; The market opened with dollars in demand to cover shorts . 
nonetheless , after the peso weakened to 7.92 per dollar , it picked up a little , &quot; a trader said . 
the benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate ended 2.4 and 1.6 centavos weaker , respectively , at 7.9100 / 7.9130 and 7.8980 / 7.9010 per dollar . 
&quot; Some brokers bought dollars in speculative deals , but began to sell long positions when they saw the peso was not about to weaken further , &quot; another trader said . 
traders said dealers had covered short dollar positions early on to hedge against a possible selloff in U.S. long bonds after the release of U.S. producer price data on Friday morning . 
&quot; The market is closely following the long bond and U.S. economic data , &quot; a dealer said . 
the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was off 1 / 32 in late trade to yield 7.11 percent . 
same-day peso contracts closed earlier 1.9 centavos weaker at 7.9000 / 7.9040 per dollar .
