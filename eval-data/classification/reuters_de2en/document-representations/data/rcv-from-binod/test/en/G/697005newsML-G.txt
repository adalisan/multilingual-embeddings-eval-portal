Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders are to meet face-to-face next week for the first time in nearly three years for talks which the U.N. sponsor hopes will make headway on how to resolve the protracted division of the island . 
the United Nations is seeking progress in the talks between Cypriot president and head of the Greek Cypriot community Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash from July 9 to 13 solid enough to survive an autumn lull in the procedure for elections on the island next year , a U.N. official said on Monday . 
&quot; Obviously in an ideal world we should be able to finish the whole thing now and that will be the end of it but probably that is not going to happen , &quot; said Gustave Feissel , head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission on the divided island . 
&quot; What we will need is to have something to come out of these meetings which will be positive , which will really indicate the way forward ( and ) which will therefore take us through the period during which it will not be possible to do anything because of the elections , &quot; he told Reuters in an interview on Monday . 
the two leaders are trekking half way around the globe to meet at a rural retreat called Troutbeck , 90 miles ( 145 kms ) north of New York city . 
two more rounds of talks are expected to follow until September . 
a lull in the negotiation process is expected some time in the autumn , when the campaign starts for elections in the Greek Cypriot-led government . 
presidential elections are scheduled to be held before the end of February 1998 . 
Clerides , elected for a five-year period in February 1993 , has not disclosed whether he will be running again for the presidency . 
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974 , when troops from Turkey invaded the island &apos;s north in reaction to a Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia engineered by the military junta ruling Greece at the time . 
the two communities have been estranged from 1963 , when a government comprising Greek and Turkish Cypriots fell apart little more than three years after independence from Britain . 
repeated attempts at reunification of the island have failed , in spite of the agreed principles reached between the two sides in 1977 and 1979 that the settlement of the Cyprus dispute should be under a bizonal bicommunal federation . 
but key disagreements remain on issues such as sovereignty , security issues and territorial claims . 
Feissel , due to be present at the talks which will be opened by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , said the talks were just the start of the process , which he said should be conducted on a &quot; give and take &quot; basis . 
and he added that progress is possible if the parties involved &quot; roll up their sleeves &quot; and get down to business . 
&quot; And make some compromises , obviously . 
that goes without saying , &quot; he said in response to a question . 
&quot; You cannot make a deal if one side or the other says &apos; I am not going to talk about issue a , b , and c because there is nothing to talk about &apos; . 
you can &apos;t make a deal that way . 
Feissel said a document would be presented to the two sides at the start of the talks , but declined to reveal its contents . 
&quot; It is being worked on ... 
I think everyone should recognise that we have been in this business now for a long time so this paper will aim to help , not to hinder .
