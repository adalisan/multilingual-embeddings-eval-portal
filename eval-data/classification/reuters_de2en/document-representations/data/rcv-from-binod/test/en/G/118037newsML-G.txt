Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and his 29-member government resigned on Tuesday to make way for the formation of a new government following recent parliamentary elections . 
&quot; The mandate of the council of ministers has ended according to the constitution so this government has resigned , &quot; Hariri said after a meeting with President Elias Hrawi . 
Hariri , a billionaire tycoon who has held office since October 1992 , is expected to be reappointed after the new parliament meets on October 22 to elect a speaker . 
he will stay on in a caretaker capacity until the new government is formed . 
it will be the third the 51-year-old Sunni Moslem politician has headed in four years . 
consultations on the choice of new prime minister will begin when parliament elects a new speaker . 
Hrawi will hear the views of each of the 128 deputies and must name the majority choice to head the new government . 
Hariri , who won his first parliamentary seat in the elections , heads one of the biggest blocs in parliament and is expected to be reappointed with the help of powerful Syrian-backed allies in parliament . 
his new strength in parliament is also expected to make it easier for him to push through projects in his multi-billion dollar reconstruction plan which were blocked by the previous parliament . 
a visit to Lebanon by French President Jacques Chirac on October 24-25 will interrupt Hrawi &apos;s consultations with the deputies . 
however , official sources have said the formation of a new government , which must receive a parliamentary vote of confidence , would probably be completed by the end of this month or the start of November .
