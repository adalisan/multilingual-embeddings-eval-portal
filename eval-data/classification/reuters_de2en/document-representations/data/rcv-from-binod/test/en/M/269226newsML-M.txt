South African stocks raced to their third succesive rise on Friday as major world stock markets surged upward ahead of the festive season , dealers said . 
a second biggest ever points rise on Wall Street on Thursday was followed by a strong showing in London and South African shares shook off a start of the week hangover to join in the party . 
there were also local factors adding to the seasonal cheer as share watchers took heart from a firming rand and Thursday &apos;s better-than-expected inflation figures . 
the all-share index closed up 72.4 points to 6,540.4 as industrials jumped 71.1 points to end at 7,795.8 . 
dealers said there had been little futures-related manipulation of the market and a solid level of institutional bargain hunting . 
it has been an unusually busy week for the market given the approach of the holiday period . 
a massive futures-related sell-off on Tuesday was followed by a firm rally for the rest of the week , but dealers said things were finally calming down . 
gold shares were buoyed by a firmer bullion price in European markets and the gold index put on a tentative 10.6 points to 1,501.9 . 
however , dealers said as long as bullion traded below $ 370 an ounce there would be little real interest in the shares .
