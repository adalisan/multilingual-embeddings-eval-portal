the Thai military believes Cambodia &apos;s Second Prime Minister Hun Sen has effectively overthrown his rival , Prince Norodom Ranariddh , an army general said here on Sunday . 
however , a Japanese Foreign Ministry statement said on Sunday that Hun Sen had agreed to open talks with Ranariddh &apos;s forces to end fighting in Phnom Penh . 
and Tea Chamras , Cambodia &apos;s co-defence minister from Ranariddh &apos;s faction , also also said there was still a chance for a political solution . 
fighting intensified in the Cambodian capital on Sunday between forces loyal to Hun Sen and to First Prime Minister Ranariddh . 
at least four people have been killed and thousands were fleeing the city above which hang thick plumes of black smoke . 
&quot; Ranariddh may have learned that Hun Sen had planned the coup against him and escaped from the country one day earlier , &quot; the Thai general , who monitors the Cambodian conflict , told Reuters . 
Ranariddh is believed to be in France . 
the general , who declined to be identified , said Hun Sen , with his Cambodian People &apos;s Party ( CPP ) , the former communist rulers of the country , would slowly take full control of the government . 
he would then launch a full-scale purge of the royalist Funcinpec party and military followers of Ranariddh , he said . 
former battlefield enemies Hun Sen and Ranariddh head an unravelling coalition government that came to power after U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 . 
Ranariddh has accused Hun Sen of launching a coup attempt . 
but a radio station controlled by Hun Sen denied the charge and said government forces were fighting Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Phnom Penh . 
a new round of civil war , with the remnants of the Khmer Rouge movement led by Khieu Samphan key players , was inevitable , the general said . 
Ranariddh &apos;s forces could be forced to flee to the jungle and join Khieu Samphan &apos;s Khmer Rouge to fight Hun Sen in the future , he said . 
&quot; Everything depends on Hun Sen now . 
if he bows to pressure from the United Nations and Southeast Asian nations to organise an election as planned for next May , then the war will be less intense , &quot; the general said . 
&quot; Otherwise a new era of &quot; killing fields &quot; will resume . 
but this time we could call it &quot; killing cities &quot; because the new war seems to be confined to the cities , &quot; he added . 
he also said that Khmer Rouge guerrillas who had already defected to the government could turn their guns on Hun Sen any time . 
Khieu Samphan , a former top leader of the Khmer Rouge hardline faction , announced on Sunday that he had broken away from the reviled Maoist Pol Pot , and was ready to abide by the Cambodian constitution . 
Ranariddh said late last month that nogotiations with the Khmer Rouge , which Hun Sen has branded illegal , could not move forward until the guerrillas recognised the constitution and broke ties with Pol Pot . 
but by early afternoon on Sunday there were several reports of efforts to end the fighting and find a political solution . 
the Japan Foreign Ministry said the president of Cambodia &apos;s parliament Chea Sim told Japan &apos;s ambassador in Phnom Penh on Sunday that Hun Sen had agreed to talk with the royalists . 
Ranariddh loyalist Tea Chamras also said a political solution was still possible . 
he said he had talked to the Cambodian co-defence minister Tea Bann on Sunday morning . 
the minister is in the Hun Sen faction . 
he told me that we can still negotiate to settle the problem by political means , &quot; said Tea Chamras , who has been in Bangkok since Friday but is unable to return to Phnom Penh because of the airport closure . 
&quot; The situation in my country is like flooding . 
when the water recedes , everything will be back to normal .
