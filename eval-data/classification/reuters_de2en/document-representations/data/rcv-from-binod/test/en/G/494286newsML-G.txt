the European Parliament on Tuesday criticised European Union countries for human rights violations ranging from begging bans in France and Germany to restrictions on meetings in Greece . 
in its third annual report on human rights in the EU , the parliament attacked Britain , Belgium and Greece for not ratifying a protocol abolishing the death penalty in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights ( ECHR ) . 
it also rejected all forms of euthanasia . 
the report -- in which parliament for the first time included minimum guarantees of income , social protection , medical treatment , housing and a clean environment in its definition of basic human rights -- criticised Britain for opting out of some EU social policy provisions . 
the deputies condemned Greece for restricting meetings of ethnic , religious and other minorities , pointing out that the ECHR only allowed curbs on freedom of association in cases where national security was threatened . 
Ireland was attacked for a law forbidding the publication of any material in favour of abortion and Austria for laws on the age of consent which discriminate against homosexuals . 
France and Germany came under fire for letting more and more local authorities ban begging . 
in an attempt to put a more positive slant on several highly sensitive issues , Euro-MPs highlighted some reform efforts . 
Greece , the only EU country which does not exempt conscientious objectors from military service , was praised for a draft law which would allow them to do civil service . 
Sweden was praised for moves to ban the possession of paedophile material , which has still not been outlawed in either Sweden or Denmark . 
Euro-MPs condemned &quot; unreservedly &quot; all forms of child sexual exploitation without explicitly mentioning Copenhagen &apos;s stance on child pornography , while welcoming a new Danish law bringing in a better system for dealing with complaints against police .
