world coffee production in 1996 / 97 is now estimated at 97.7 million bags . 
of this robusta will amount to 32.2 million bags and arabica to 65.5 million bags . 
this is somewhat higher than in our previous estimate and significantly above the 1995 / 96 figure of 87.7 million bags . 
the increase largely reflects the recovery in Brazil after drought and frost damaged the 1995 / 96 crop , but better husbandry after higher producer prices in recent years also played its role . 
about 18 million bags is expected to be produced in Africa , with Ivory Coast likely to attain a record output of between 4.2 and 5.0 million bags . 
North and Central America will probably produce a little less with output expected to reach 18.1 million bags . 
Mexico will be the leading producer with the USDA forecasting 5.4 million bags , which compares to industry estimates of 5.0 to 5.4 million bags . 
production in South America is put at 43.2 million bags , significantly up on last year &apos;s figure of 33.4 million bags . 
as is always the case , Brazil tops the list with 26 to 27 million bags , sharply up from the weather damaged crop of 15.8 million bags the previous year . 
it is forecast that Asia will produce 17.1 million bags of which Indonesia is expected to provide up to 8.0 million bags . 
coffee demand is fairly price inelastic , but the retail prices seen in 1994 and 1995 cannot but have affected offtake . 
as a result it is estimated that consumption in importing countries fell to 69.7 million bags in 1993 / 94 from 72.9 million bags the previous year . 
it remained at the lower level the following year but recovered to 71.4 million bags in 1995 / 96 following lower retail prices . 
consumption in coffee producing countries in 1995 / 96 is estimated to have risen by two per cent to 25 million bags , largely reflecting higher Brazilian consumption . 
total offtake in 1996 / 97 is now estimated at 98 million bags , which suggests a fairly balanced situation . 
this will prevent any replenishment of consumer stocks unless producers decide to unload stock onto the market . 
we have made projections of world coffee consumption over the next few years on two separate bases . 
assuming no increase in prices we put total offtake in 1997 / 98 at 101.2 million bags , rising to 102.6 million bags the following year and 104.1 million bags in 1999 / 2000 . 
however , a quite different picture appears if we assume annual price increases of 10 per cent , even on the basis of reasonably burgeoning economies . 
then we see 98.2 million bags for 1997 / 98 , 97.6 million bags the next year and 97.0 million bags in 1999 / 2000 . 
these predictions illustrate the danger of sponsoring measures aimed at increasing prices without due regard first being paid to the underlying market dynamics . 
to some extent the retention scheme of the ACPC countries has succeeded in bringing control of stocks back into the hands of the producers and also in improving the return they have received for their coffee . 
it must not be overlooked , however , that it has also encouraged roasters to adopt a &quot; just-in-time &quot; policy which cannot be in the long term interests of the producers . 
despite the ACPC retention scheme theoretically limiting exports in July / June 1995 / 96 to 60.4 million bags , crop year figures point to exports in 1995 / 96 of 70.2 million bags and the gap between these two figures cannot all reflect the difference between the two types of year or extra shipments by non-ACPC members . 
the goal of member countries is to seek a balance between world supply and demand with the aim of ensuring fair and remunerative prices . 
our statistics indicate that they may achieve that goal in 1996 / 97 without bringing great hardship upon themselves . 
what must not be overlooked , however , is that stock holding is expensive . 
traditionally stocks in producing countries have been held by governmental or quasi-governmental organizations . 
because of changes which have recently taken place stocks in some countries are now held by the private sector which may be less inclined to finance stock holding in the future .
