some Asian central banks are quietly but steadily dumping U.S. dollars and German marks for the yen in order to boost the Japanese currency portion of their foreign exchange reserves , senior Japanese bankers say . 
&quot; Southeast Asia &apos;s public investors were aggressive in yen purchases when it weakened to 122-124 to the dollar . 
they are also placing persistent bids on the yen in crosses , particularly for the mark , &quot; said Shinichiro Maruyama , chief of spot trading at the Industrial Bank of Japan . 
he added that these moves reflected a portfolio reshuffle by the central banks and an enhancement of their yen weighting . 
&quot; The ( recent ) weak recovery , if any at all , in the mark against the yen proves that they have been quantitative , outright yen buyers behind the scenes , &quot; said Takashi Okura , chief trader at the First National Bank of Chicago &apos;s Tokyo branch . 
Okura noted that Southeast Asian central banks , along with East European central banks which need yen to pay back their yen loans from Japan , were driving the well-bid Japanese unit . 
the move to procure yen holdings is in response to the recent Group of Seven ( G7 ) statement suggesting its reluctance to see a further dollar rise , and also a perception that a subtle shift has occured in U.S. monetary authorities &apos; public policy toward the dollar , bankers said . 
in February , the Group of Seven industrialised countries of Japan , the United States , Germany , Britain , France , Italy and Canada said in a statement that major misalignments in exchange markets noted in the April 1995 communique have been corrected . 
the dollar hit a record low of 79.75 yen in April 1995 . 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin reiterated this week that the dollar had been strong for &quot; quite some time &quot; . 
&quot; Not just in the eyes of the G7 but also from the perspective of Asian central banks , a not-so-strong-a-dollar would be beneficial to the region , &quot; Taisuke Tanaka , a market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston &apos;s Tokyo branch , said . 
due to the dollar &apos;s strength particularly against the yen , Asian economic growth has been slowing since early 1996 . 
this is because East and Southeast Asian currencies are loosely linked to the dollar , and the higher dollar or stronger local currencies cuts the competitiveness of their products against Japanese goods . 
Japanese bankers said , however , that they doubt that those yen purchases are backed by any policy coordination among Asian central banks which together possess more than 40 percent of the global foreign exchange reserves . 
they said that Southeast Asian central banks continue to steadily unload the dollar for the yen , although their activities are more noticeable in cross-yen trading . 
in the recent weeks , persistent yen buying interest by those central banks has often overwhelmed speculative yen sales for the mark by U.S. hedge funds , traders said . 
in Tokyo on Monday , U.S. hedge funds tried to drive up the mark to well over 71.50 yen , only to be thwarted by strong bids on the yen by a Southeast Asian central bank , traders said . 
the following day , those U.S. hedge funds turned mark sellers , they said . 
the mark was quoted at around 70.55 yen in late Tokyo morning trade on Friday . 
meanwhile , IBJ &apos;s Maruyama said that large European investment accounts , which hold a significant amount of yen short positions , have also been unwinding those positions as a part of their efforts to reshuffle their portfolios . 
this combined with the Asian central banks &apos; yen purchases have accentuated the mark &apos;s weakness versus the yen , he said .
