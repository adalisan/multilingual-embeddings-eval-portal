Indonesian palm olein prices remained soft in late trading on Friday on the back of poor buying interest , traders said . 
they said olein was generally holding at 1,375-80 rupiah / kg in Jakarta , but quotes were also heard at 1,370 rupiah . 
crude palm oil was last done at 1,165 rupiah / kg in Medan at a tender . 
an official from state-run marketing board KPB said its October crude palm oil allocation price would remain unchanged at September &apos;s 1,010 rupiah / kg , but declined to comment on talk that the quantity would be reduced this month due to lower than expected output from state plantations . 
traders said market sentiment remained weak and that prices were expected to trend lower next week as fresh olein supplies were scheduled to land in Jakarta . 
&quot; One player is expected to unload a shipment of 4,800 tonnes of olein next week , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Another 5,500 tonnes ordered by BULOG is also expected to be unloaded next week . 
he said the shipment belonging to BULOG , the state logistics agency , was part of a consignment the agency had ordered from Malaysia more than two months ago when it intervened in the market to lower local prices .
