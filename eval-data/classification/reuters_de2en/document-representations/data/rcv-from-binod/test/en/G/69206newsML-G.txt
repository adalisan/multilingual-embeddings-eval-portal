a senior doctor preparing President Boris Yeltsin for heart surgery cast doubt on whether the Russian president would survive an early operation , but the Kremlin on Sunday maintained a strict silence on his remarks . 
the presidential press office issued no statements and could not be reached for comment , despite a newly-declared policy of openness . 
a Kremlin spokesman said on Saturday only that cardiac surgeon Renat Akchurin &apos;s remarks had been distributed &quot; to all the people concerned &quot; . 
Russian media treated the comments with caution , carrying them without fanfare . 
even the opposition communists did not respond , saying only that party leader Gennady Zyuganov had left on a trip to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg . 
Akchurin said on Saturday that Yeltsin must have suffered a third , and unreported , heart attack just before he was elected in July to a second four-year term . 
Akchurin told Reuters that the damage to the president &apos;s heart could make the planned bypass surgery too risky and the operation might have to be postponed or cancelled . 
he and other doctors , including U.S. cardiologist Michael DeBakey , will make a final decision next Wednesday or Thursday . 
&quot; The most likely decision is that the operation will be postponed , &quot; Akchurin told French TF1 television . 
&quot; In effect , if the risks are high , no one will want to take the chance ... A surgeon does not jump off a plane without a parachute . 
in a comment on the overall political situation , presidential chief of staff Anatoly Chubais said it was not time for rivals to try to step into 65-year-old Yeltsin &apos;s shoes . 
&quot; Those politicians who believe that it is time to take up starting positions in a presidential campaign will very soon realise that they have jumped the gun , &quot; Chubais told a congress of the Russia &apos;s Democratic Choice party in Moscow on Saturday . 
Akchurin told a U.S. television interviewer on Friday that Yeltsin had suffered his third heart attack in about 12 months in late June or early July . 
he said later he had not personally treated the Kremlin leader at the time but he concluded from examining Yeltsin &apos;s heart later and from considering media reports that a new heart attack had occurred . 
his remarks implied that he had not known what he was undertaking when he agreed to conduct the operation , which Yeltsin announced on September 5 . 
Akchurin &apos;s disclosures could worry Western leaders who regard Yeltsin as the guarantor of stability in a vast unpredictable country . 
Yeltsin &apos;s longer-than-expected stay at Moscow &apos;s elite Central Clinical Hospital has also caused concern . 
he was still there at the weekend , more than a week after he was admitted for tests . 
a decree issued on Thursday confirmed that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , Yeltsin &apos;s constitutional deputy , would govern while the president was incapacitated . 
but other ambitious and powerful figures , including Russian security chief Alexander Lebed , were expected to continue to assert the importance of their own roles in the hierarchy . 
Zyuganov , whom Yeltsin defeated in the presidential election , told Reuters on Friday that he was now best placed to become the next Kremlin leader . 
he has accused the media of bias against him and blasted the Kremlin secrecy . 
but he made no comment on Akchurin &apos;s remarks before leaving for the Council of Europe , which is due to discuss the Chechnya conflict . 
his party also made no formal statement .
