thousands of Winnipeg residents fled their homes on Wednesday as Red River flood waters seeped through a 16-foot ( 5-metre ) earthen dike . 
&quot; I &apos;m trying to get my kids out and the stuff that we had packed up from St. Norbert out to the car , &quot; said Anne Barton , who was among 8,000 people ordered from their homes in the south Winnipeg district of St. Norbert by Tuesday night . 
she moved her family 2-1 / 2 miles ( 4 km ) upstream to her in-laws &apos; home behind a massive dike on the Red River . 
&quot; We were awakened by police who told us to get out , &quot; Keith Christie said from a city transit bus that shuttled evacuees . 
the Red River was forecast to crest on Thursday or Friday at the southern edge of Winnipeg , Manitoba &apos;s capital and biggest city , with about 650,000 residents . 
the last time Winnipeg residents were evacuated ahead of a Red River flood was in 1950 when 100,000 people were forced out . 
this year &apos;s flood should cover twice the area flooded in 1950 , inundating up to 800 square miles ( 2,072 sq km ) . 
Winnipeg Water engineer Jack Marquardson said 75 homes were evacuated within one hour of the leak around a plugged culvert in the neighbourhood dike . 
&quot; There are 50 soldiers and engineers to shore up the dike and we &apos;re going to do our best to repair this dike and get people back in their homes if we can , &quot; he said . 
more than 28,000 Canadians and 50,000 Americans have been forced from their homes by the rise of the Red River . 
two Canadian boys and a man were presumed drowned last week in rising waters and another man died of a heart attack while sandbagging his south Winnipeg home on Saturday . 
Winnipeggers &apos; fears focused on an almost complete but quickly built 25-mile ( 40-km ) earthen dike along the city &apos;s southwest flank and the ability of a massive ditch on the southeast to part the flood waters of the rising &quot; Red Sea . 
&quot; The Floodway was built in 1968 to divert high Red River waters around the limits of the city . 
the devastation on both sides of the border has led to help from across North America . 
Canadian airlines have offered discount tickets to Winnipeg for volunteer sandbaggers and an anonymous donor offered $ 2,000 checks to homeless Grand forks , North Dakota , residents . 
the usually tame Red River swelled to 22 times its normal flow this month as record-breaking winter snows melted . 
the flood could be the worst seen in Manitoba since 1852 . 
crews on Wednesday had just about completed reinforcing a highway surrounding Winnipeg as a last line of defence for people living in the city &apos;s southwest . 
&quot; We moved our stuff all day yesterday . 
my brother &apos;s a surveyor and he took the top of the dike and it comes one foot ( 0.348 metre ) under our main floor and it &apos;s six inches ( 15.24 cm ) over the garage floor , &quot; evacuee Peter Tataryn said .
