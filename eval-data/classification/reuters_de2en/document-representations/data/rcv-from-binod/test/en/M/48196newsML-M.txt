the Australian share market ended weaker on Thursday , weighed down by major resource issues as investors factored in recent declines and further anticipated falls for base metal prices . 
the benchmark All Ordinaries index ended 9.7 points down at 2,236.6 , off its intra-session low of 2,227.3 . 
the September share price index futures closed 13 points down at 2,236 , a 0.6 point discount to the underlying index . 
brokers said negative comments on the outlook for copper and steel prices by BHP managing director John Prescott on Tuesday were still being factored into the market by investors today . 
&quot; It has been a mixed day but the underlying theme has been the continuing slide of the big resource companies , BHP and CRA , &quot; a dealer from a Melbourne-based brokerage said . 
the dealer said the two bellwether stocks , which both have large weightings in the All Ordinaies index , accounted for most of the market &apos;s weakness today and effectively held back the entire resources sector . 
&quot; Selling of the majors seemed to slow down a bit this afternoon and we might see a pause in the selling on Friday , especially if the U.S. market holds up tonight , &quot; the dealer said . 
as on Wednesday , investors were seen switching from resource issues into high yielding stocks with the bank sector benefitting the most . 
of the majors , the Commonwealth and ANZ banks saw the best gains although all the majors were firmer on the day . 
after the close of trade , the RTZ-CRA dual-listed mining group announced a first half net profit of A $ 714 million and an interim dividend of 20.65 cents .
