wall Street &apos;s raging bull celebrated a birthday Aug . 12 , but not all investors agreed on how many candles to put on the cake . 
some on Wall Street date the birth of the current bull run to Aug . 12 , 1982 , when the Dow Jones Industrial average touched down at 777 . 
but others see a much younger rally , dating from late 1994 , with legs to carry it into the next century . 
still others date the current trend from late 1990 , after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent stocks in a tailspin , arguing that the bull is living on borrowed time . 
investors Tuesday did not exactly pop champagne for the bull &apos;s birthday . 
the Dow industrials tumbled 101 points to close at 7,961 . 
those in the 15-year birthday camp see a long-term trend line rising from Aug . 12 , 1982 , punctuated but not broken by notable corrections in 1984 , 1987 , 1990 and 1994 . 
in the 15-year run , the Dow has climbed about 930 percent . 
however , prudential Securities technical analyst Ralph Acampora bases his bull market thesis , which anticipated the Dow breaking 7,000 and sees the 10,000 mark possible by June 1998 , on the view that the bull market was born in November 1994 . 
&quot; A typical secular bull market lasts several years ( perhaps three to four years but certainly more than 2-1 / 2 years ) , &quot; he wrote in a recent research note . 
Gregory NIE , technical analyst at Everen Securities , said he viewed the move begun in late 1994 as the &quot; primary trend . 
because of the advances in communications and the global nature of the stock market , time frames for market trends have been compressed , he said . 
&quot; The reaction time to catalysts has shrunk dramatically , &quot; NIE said . 
some analysts argue there may actually be two bull market trends running concurrently . 
they cite a short-term &quot; cyclic &quot; move based on factors such as interest rates , price / earnings ratios and currency fluctuations , and a longer-term &quot; secular &quot; trend , based on broader macroeconomic issues such as the effort to balance the U.S. budget . 
the average cyclic bull market from the 1950s has lasted about 35-1 / 2 months , which would leave a bull run started in late 1994 little time left , said John brooks , director of marketing at Notley Information Service , which provides technical analysis on global markets . 
&quot; This particular cyclic bull market is probably long in the tooth and is about to give up the ghost , &quot; brooks said , adding that 1998 could be a bear-market year . 
but the longer-term trend may still remain intact . 
&quot; The longer-term secular move probably has another wave in it to the year 2001 or so , &quot; he said . 
then there are those that argue that the question of the bull market &apos;s age is academic and does not address traditional signals of a potential market top such as current elevated price / earnings ratios and low dividend yields . 
&quot; Whether this thing is three-and-a-half years old , 10 years old or 15 years old really doesn &apos;t matter , &quot; said Ralph Bloch , chief technical analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates . 
whatever its age , the bull market has defied many on Wall Street who have tried to chart its demise , and it may continue to do so . 
&quot; Once you run off the historical charts , anything can happen , &quot; said Bob Dickey , technical analyst at Dain Bosworth .
