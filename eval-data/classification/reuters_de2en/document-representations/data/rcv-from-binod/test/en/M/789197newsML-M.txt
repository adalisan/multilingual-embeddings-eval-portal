September Brent futures were weaker in late trading on Friday , still driven by news of imminent Iraqi crude exports . 
September Brent on SIMEX last traded $ 18.86 per barrel , down four cents , after London fell 30 cents overnight . 
Iraq was expected to start exporting by as early as next week , which has dragged Brent prices down in two consecutive days . 
with the uptrend support of $ 18.90 having been tested and broken , brokers expected prices to slip further when IPE opened .
