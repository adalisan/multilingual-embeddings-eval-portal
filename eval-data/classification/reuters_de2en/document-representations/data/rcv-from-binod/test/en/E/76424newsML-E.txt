Morocco , hit by harsh drought in 1995 , has set its sights on achieving rapid economic growth through promotion of private enterprise , improvement of foreign debt and rigorous management of its finances . 
finance Minister Mohamed Kabbaj told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday : &quot; This year , we are going to register a growth level ( in Gross Domestic Product , GDP ) in double figures . 
we are finding good balances , both in our budget and in our balance of payments . 
&quot; For 1996 we are going to end with a growth rate of 10 to 11 percent , &quot; he said . 
but , with the lesson of 1995 in mind when drought took GDP growth to minus 7.6 percent , Kabbaj said : &quot; For 1997 we have estimated a growth figure in the order of five percent . 
Morocco &apos;s farm output , which makes up 20 percent of GDP , slumped dramatically in 1995 , hitting export earnings and meaning Rabat had to import cereals costing 3.9 billion dirhams ( $ 448 million ) against 1.5 billion the previous year . 
Kabbaj said all the data this year provided Morocco with a good base for growth . 
privatisation was expected to bring in five billion dirhams ( $ 575 million ) this year and foreign investment of between $ 600 and $ 700 million by the year end . 
he forecast inflation of 4.5 percent for 1996 against 6.1 percent for 1995 , and a budget deficit of below three percent of GDP for the budget year ( July 1996 to June 1997 ) against 5.3 percent for the calendar year 1995 . 
the current account deficit was expected to be 2.0 percent for fiscal 1996 / 97 against 4.8 PCT in calendar 1995 . 
the minister said he saw unemployment , officially 17 percent , as one of Morocco &apos;s main challenges - exacerbated by population growth , estimated at 2.8 percent . 
farming accounts for nearly half the workforce of 10 million , out of the 27 million population . 
most of the jobless are young and are found in the main cities and towns . 
some 250,000 to 300,000 people seeking jobs arrive each year on the market , the minister said . 
Rabat saw the best answer in rapid economic growth . 
&quot; If nothing is done globally between now and the year 2000 to 2003 we could reach a jobless level of 24 percent . 
but if we have economic growth of six to seven percent ( annually ) , the level of jobless will drop to nine or 10 percent , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We are putting all our efforts into assuring rapid growth because it is the most effective way , long term . 
we need to improve our competitiveness and encourage foreign investment . 
&quot; I do not see why Thailand , Singapore and other southeast Asian countries have growth of 10 percent and not Morocco . 
Kabbaj said commercial foreign debt -- estimated at $ 5.0 billion -- as well as the international situation and the drought had given Morocco a &quot; very , very hard year &quot; in 1995 . 
but the value of Moroccan debt on the market had risen to 77.5 cents , the best figure since 1983 , he said . 
&quot; This means the bankers have confidence in Morocco . 
one foreign economic expert told Reuters that Morocco &apos;s debt repayment / service ratio was now 32.6 percent of foreign income , &quot; rather high against the average of around 17 percent &quot; . 
Kabbaj said the government had launched an international tender for credit rating offers . 
it was examining with banks , particularly U.S. ones , offers from several firms . 
Rabat wanted a &quot; a global approach to the debt , had enough reserves , estimated at 35 billion dirhams ( $ 4 billion ) , for this and would only &quot; go on the market to improve our indebtedness . 
( $ 1 = 8.7 dirhams )
