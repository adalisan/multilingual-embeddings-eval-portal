Boris Yeltsin travels to Germany on Wednesday for what should be a congratulatory slap on the back from Western public opinion and his friend Helmut Kohl , but which could see ticklish moments over NATO and looted art . 
the Russian president will receive a &quot; Man of the Year &quot; award from the German media in the spa resort of Baden-Baden , a title previously won by late French president Francois Mitterrand , late Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin and by Kohl himself . 
but despite a hearty personal rapport between the two big men , who will relish the chance for a chat amid the parks and restaurants of the stately town , Yeltsin &apos;s talks with the German chancellor are likely to present some awkward moments . 
the serious business will focus on intensive efforts to negotiate a charter defining Russia &apos;s relationship with the expanding NATO defence alliance as well as on bilateral economic ties . 
Germany is Russia &apos;s biggest financial backer . 
it has been irritated by the Russian parliament &apos;s refusal to return a hoard of art treasures seized by the Red Army from the defeated Nazis . 
Kohl , meeting Yeltsin for the second time in just three months , told Itar-Tass news agency on Monday he was confident in their &quot; personal trust and friendship &quot; and that Russia &apos;s dispute with NATO would be settled to mutual satisfaction . 
&quot; I have no doubt there will be such a settlement of these issues , which will offer Russia a solid position , worthy of this country , in a future European security architecture and reflecting Russia &apos;s interests , &quot; Kohl said . 
but increasingly frenetic diplomatic negotiations over a NATO-Russia charter -- NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana holds talks in Moscow on Tuesday -- suggest the two sides are still some way apart ahead of a self-imposed July deadline . 
Moscow fiercely opposes NATO plans to admit former Warsaw Pact states as members but Yeltsin agreed with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Helsinki last month to put the dispute aside and push ahead with a new treaty that would give Russia a say , though not membership , in the expanded Atlantic alliance . 
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said last week in Paris that Russia could sign a deal with NATO in the French capital on May 27 , weeks before the Madrid summit in July when NATO will issue membership invitations to some east European states , most likely Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . 
but U.S. officials have sounded sceptical and NATO sources said the conditions Primakov set last week were a return to a hard line not heard since before Helsinki . 
on Monday , Yeltsin told Primakov , who meets Solana on Tuesday , that Russia wanted a worthwhile , binding and balanced deal with NATO -- &quot; But not at any price . 
Western leaders , for whom Kohl has often used his personal sway with Yeltsin to try to defuse diplomatic tensions , may hope the informal chats in Baden-Baden can aid the NATO negotiations . 
less vital but no less awkward could be discussions about the vast collection of art treasures shipped out of occupied Germany by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin . 
Bonn wants them back . 
but Moscow &apos;s communist-led parliament is insisting they stay . 
they overruled Yeltsin &apos;s veto this month and the matter seems to be heading for the constitutional court . 
&quot; Boris Yeltsin and I will work further to arrive at joint decisions on this issue , &quot; Kohl told TASS . 
Yeltsin , 66 , arrives in Stuttgart and goes on to Baden-Baden with his wife Naina and , for the first time in a such a public role abroad , his younger daughter , Tatyana Dyachenko , 37 . 
credited with fashioning the image that helped Yeltsin win a new term last year and with looking out for his interests during his heart surgery last autumn , Tatyana is thought to wield considerable influence though she has , as yet , no official post .
