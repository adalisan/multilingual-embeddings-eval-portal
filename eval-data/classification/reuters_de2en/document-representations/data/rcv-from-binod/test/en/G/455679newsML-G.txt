veteran Sudanese guerrilla chief John Garang said on Thursday that the capture of the southern town of Yei from government troops was a sign that the rebels would be able to take the main regional town soon . 
Yei is a key town on the main road to the southern capital of Juba -- the biggest prize in Sudan &apos;s bitter civil war between the mainly Christian and animist south and the Moslem , Arabised north . 
when reporters arrived on Thursday to meet Garang , head of the Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , the town was empty , abandoned by civilians who fled a bitter battle . 
Yei lies 1,370 km ( 849 miles ) away from the capital Khartoum and only 130 km ( 80 miles ) to Juba . 
empty thatched huts , rotting mangoes and scattered Koran pages greeted reporters flown in from the Kenyan capital Nairobi . 
abandoned howitzer guns and ammunition pointed to fierce battles for Yei . 
Garang said with the capture of Yei , the war in southern Sudan was almost over . 
there were also burned-out trucks and several government outposts that had been abandoned with weapons left inside . 
Garang said rebels would seize Juba but declined to say when . 
&quot; Our forces now are at Lanya , near Juba where they will soon launch a major attack to capture Juba and bring a new Sudan , &quot; a confident Garang told reporters . 
&quot; Khartoum accuses us of being helped by foreigners but this is not true , we have done what they didn &apos;t expect us to do against major logistical problems , we have deployed our soldiers all over the ( Yei-Juba ) road , &quot; he added . 
Garang said in its offensive since last week the rebels had killed about 3,000 Sudanese government troops and militiamen and wounded or captured 1,000 . 
there was no independent confirmation of the numbers . 
he said described the fighting for Yei as &quot; vicious &quot; . 
the Sudanese government accuses Ethiopia , Eritrea and Uganda of backing an alliance of Sudanese rebels fighting the Khartoum government . 
all three deny the charge . 
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni threatened last month to resolve his problems with Sudan on the battlefield . 
Khartoum and Kampala accuse each other of sheltering rebels . 
the SPLA has has made significant gains in the east and south since January . 
Western diplomats say Garang &apos;s latest and most successful offensive since 1983 had scared the government of President Hassan Omar al-Bashir . 
the war in Africa &apos;s biggest nation has sent thousands fleeing into exile in neighbouring states and killed many more on the battlefield and through starvation .
