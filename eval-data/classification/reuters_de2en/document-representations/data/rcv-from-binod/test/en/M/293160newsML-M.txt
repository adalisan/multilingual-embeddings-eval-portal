the Kenyan shilling firmed on an increased dollar supply on Wednesday , dealers said . 
the Central Bank of Kenya posted a mean shilling average of 54.77 from 54.81 against the dollar . 
against the pound , it was posted at 92.90 from 92.85 . 
&quot; The shilling &apos;s gaining strength because there are too many dollars coming in from agricultural exporters , &quot; a dealer said . 
another dealer said the shilling was appreciating because interest in the dollar was waning . 
dealers said the market opened at 54.65 / 75 and by mid-morning , was trading at 54.60 / 72 levels . 
&quot; Unless the central bank intervenes , I see the shilling gaining strength , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The bank is normally the biggest stumbling block to the shilling &apos;s appreciation . 
but some dealers said the shilling &apos;s near-term direction remained unclear as large buy orders were anticipated in the market . 
the money market was liquid . 
overnight rates remained unchanged at 10 percent .
