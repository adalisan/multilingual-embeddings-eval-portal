Chile overtook Uruguay in the South American World Cup qualifying competition on Tuesday after beating the two-times world champions 1-0 in a defensive , foul-ridden match . 
Marcelo Salas scored the winner in the 59th minute , rising to head in a cross by Victor Hugo Castaneda to send the 70,000 crowd into a state of near delirium . 
Uruguay concentrated their efforts on achieving a 0-0 draw until falling behind and then showed their initial cautious tactics had been totally misguided as they dominated the remainder of the game . 
Chile , for their part , took off striker Sebastian Rosental and replaced him with defender Cristian Mora almost immediately after scoring . 
the result meant Chile moved into fifth place in the single nine-team group , leaping over Peru and Uruguay . 
the defeat was Uruguay &apos;s third in five qualifying matches and seemed to illustrate the once great soccer nation is in a state of perpetual decline . 
the Uruguayans , who won the World Cup in 1930 and 1950 , dragged veteran Enzo Francescoli out of international retirement after losing 3-1 to Colombia , but the 1986 World Cup survivor went off injured at halftime on Tuesday . 
only three points separate Argentina in fourth place and Bolivia in eighth . 
the top four teams will take part in the 1998 World Cup finals , where they join Brazil who are exempt from the qualifiers as holders .

Chile - Nelson Tapia , Cristian Castaneda , Ronald Fuentes , Javier Margas , Pedro Reyes , Luis Perez ( Ivo Basay , 46th minute ) , Victor Hugo Castaneda ( Jorge Contreras , 69th ) , Fernando Cornejo , Chavarra , Sebastian Rozental ( Cristian Mora , 77th ) , Marcelo Salas .
