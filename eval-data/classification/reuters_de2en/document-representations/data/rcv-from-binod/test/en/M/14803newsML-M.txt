Pakistan &apos;s new crop cotton rates rose on Monday on demand from large spinning mills and dealers said they were likely to firm again on Tuesday . 
&quot; Rates for new crop NIAB-78 rose mainly due to heavy buying by big spinners , &quot; said broker Nasim Usman at the private Karachi Cotton Association .
