British industrial production rose 1.2 percent in April , after a 0.2 percent fall in March , official figures showed on Monday . 
prices at the factory gate , a key indicator of inflationary pressures , rose 0.1 percent in May to show a 1.0 percent change on May 1996 . 
the price figures were in line with analysts &apos; expectations while output data showed more robust growth than expected . 
analysts said the output figures showed the economy was still growing strongly . 
&quot; Certainly on the manufacturing side it indicates that the strength of sterling has yet to have an impact on manufacturing production , &quot; said Philip Shaw , economist at Union plc . 
&quot; It really vindicates the Bank of England &apos;s decision last Friday to raise interest rates by 25 basis points . 
government bonds dipped after the figures while sterling firmed slightly . 
interest rates have been raised twice since the Labour government came to power on May 1 and now stand at 6.5 percent .
