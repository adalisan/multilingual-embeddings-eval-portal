Burundi &apos;s army said on Friday troops found on Thursday the bodies of 100 civilians massacred by Hutu rebels in Makamba province in the south of the country . 
&quot; We found 100 bodies in Kayogoro commune . 
rebels told the people to come with them and then killed them , &quot; said army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi . 
he gave no details . 
Kayogoro commune is about 15 km ( 10 miles ) northwest of the border with Tanzania . 
for the last two weeks , Burundi &apos;s Tutsi-dominated army in Makamba has been fighting Hutu rebels infiltrating from northwestern Tanzania , military sources said . 
the army said on Monday troops killed 140 rebels in Makamba last week but army sources said casualties were much higher . 
more than 150,000 people , mostly civilians , have been killed in massacres and civil war between the army and rebels since troops killed Burundi &apos;s Hutu president in 1993 . 
on Wednesday , regional African leaders eased sanctions imposed since military ruler Pierre Buyoya seized power in a coup last July . 
the African leaders , meeting in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha , also recognised Buyoya as president at their summit . 
the largest Burundian Hutu rebel group , the National Council for the Defence of Democracy , condemned the easing of sanctions and said the move would only benefit Buyoya &apos;s military junta .
