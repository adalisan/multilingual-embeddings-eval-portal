Australian paedophile suspect Phillip Bell is to ask a South African court to allow him to appeal against an extradition order , court officials said on Tuesday . 
bell , who faces 215 charges of child sex abuse relating to boys aged 10 to 18 in Australia , is also seeking to reduce the number of charges against him , arguing South Africa &apos;s statute of limitations on crimes must apply even though Australian law does not have this exemption . 
the request for an appeal is expected to be heard later this month in the Grahamstown high court where officials say the case will be speedily handled due to the international implications . 
a South African magistrate ruled last month that Bell should be extradited to Australia to stand trial . 
bell , 62 , was arrested after a 10-month worldwide police hunt in January in the holiday town of Jeffrey &apos;s Bay , where he ran a surfing school for youngsters . 
his extradition is subject to the final approval of South African Justice Minister Dullah Omar , and he remains in custody .
