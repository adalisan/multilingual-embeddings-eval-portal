Malaysia on Thursday called for a mechanism to allow better relations between the armed forces of Malaysia and Thailand in policing their long and sometimes troubled border . 
Malaysian Defence Minister Syed Hamid Albar , opening a three-day meeting with Thai officials , said the annual meetings of the General Border Committee ( GBC ) had been a key instrument in promoting bilateral ties . 
&quot; With that in mind , maybe it is timely that a fresh impetus in the form of an improved structure which allows better inter-armed forces / police relations is injected into the agreement , &quot; Syed said . 
Malaysia and Thailand have conducted joint naval , air and army exercises under the auspices of the GBC for the past two decades . 
Thai Prime Minister and Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh is leading his country &apos;s delegation at the talks . 
the greatest achievement of the border committee was arranging the surrender of the last remnants of a communist insurgency in 1989 , Syed said . 
for years after World War Two , the 647-km ( 400-mile ) border was a no man &apos;s land where communist guerrillas conducted hit and run raids during the last days of the British colonial period in what was then known as Malaya . 
most of the former insurgents are settled in &quot; friendship &quot; or &quot; peace &quot; villages near the border in both Malaysia and Thailand where they are undergoing rehabilitation and job training . 
&quot; I am happy to see the efforts made by your government in rehabilitating the former armed members of the CPM ( Communist Party of Malaysia ) and the development of peace villages , &quot; Syed said . 
&quot; We firmly believe that with their new-found wealth , they will not return to their old ways but thrive further to achieve their economic dreams . 
these days the biggest problem on the border is rampant smuggling and the illegal entry of thousands of people , mostly from the Indian subcontinent , looking for jobs in labour-starved Malaysia . 
Malaysia ruffled some feathers in Thailand last year after building a three-metre ( 10-foot ) high wall topped with barbed wire to thwart the smuggling of goods and people . 
Thailand objected because the two countries have not agreed on the exact demarcation of their border . 
Chavalit and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad agreed in February that the two countries would jointly develop those areas of the border that have been difficult to demarcate .
