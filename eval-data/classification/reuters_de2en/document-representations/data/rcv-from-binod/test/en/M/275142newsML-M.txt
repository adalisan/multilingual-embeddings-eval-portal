the Turkish central bank began selling dollars for lira to banks in early afternoon trade to restrain the U.S. currency &apos;s rise , which was fuelled by persistent year-end demand , bankers said . 
the lira firmed to around 106,800 to the dollar from the low of 106,930 it touched before the intervention . 
&quot; There was a mild fluctuation in lira / dollar rates in early afternoon as some banks sold dollars . 
but the lira again weakened to below 106,900 , prompting central bank intervention , &quot; said a private banker . 
demand for the U.S. currency has recently been buoyed by some banks &apos; moves to close their short currency positions and by rising importers &apos; dollar purchases ahead of the year-end . 
bankers said the market had been cautious since the opening amid expectations of dollar sales by the central bank after last week &apos;s three rounds of intervention .
