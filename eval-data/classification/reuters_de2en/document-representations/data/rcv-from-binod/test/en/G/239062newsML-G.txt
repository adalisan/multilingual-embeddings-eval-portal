the Barbarians are due at the gates of Twickenham on Saturday but it is sharp-suited men with mobile phones who are doing most of the looting and pillaging in English rugby these days . 
whatever happens in Australia &apos;s farewell fixture at the end of an unbeaten test tour , the Wallabies will return home from Europe with first-hand evidence of the extent to which professional attitudes have taken root in the northern hemisphere . 
this week &apos;s news that South Africa &apos;s World Cup-winning captain Francois Pienaar has joined the north London club Saracens for at least two years on a contract worth upwards of 400,000 pounds sterling ( $ 649,000 ) would once have been inconceivable . 
now the deal merely represents the latest slab along the lucrative yellow-brick road the British game is currently taking towards ... well , no one knows quite where yet . 
Saracens , bought by millionaire businessman Nigel Wray a year ago , have jostled their way to the front with a series of bold initiatives which have attracted the world &apos;s most capped player , Philippe Sella , and the world &apos;s leading points scorer , Michael Lynagh . 
Pienaar will also find himself rubbing shoulders with assorted other notables . 
Wallaby prop Tony Daly , England scrum-half Kyran Bracken and a clutch of Irish and Welsh internationals have already climbed aboard the Wray gravy train , transforming a club where corporate hospitality used to mean a pie and a pint at halftime . 
across the capital at Harlequins , it &apos;s a similar story . 
the diverse accents of Welsh lock Gareth Llewellyn and Irish captain Keith Wood blend in with Frenchmen Laurent Cabannes and Laurent Benezech . 
rugby league signings Gary Connolly and Robbie Paul have had more multicultural experiences in three months than in their entire careers put together . 
the one certainty is of more signings like Pienaar and Argentine prop Federico Mendez . 
the latter has joined bath for 18 months for a reported 135,000 pounds ( $ 219,000 ) , despite the counter attraction of a Pumas tour of England . 
bath already have four hookers , including two of the most promising English teenage players in that position . 
still they plumped for Mendez , putting short-term glory ahead of long-term development . 
at the last count there were 203 foreign players playing as professionals in English soccer , with dozens more invited for trials . 
English rugby clubs have enthusiastically embraced the same creed , without always seeming to consult their bank managers . 
the gap between the haves and have-nots is widening almost daily . 
already match fees have been sharply reduced at London Irish where the arrival of the professional era provided an immediate culture shock . 
at the start of the season , the first-team squad were all issued with top-of-the-range cars , four of them to players living in the same house . 
inside a week , a neighbour had rung the police insisting they must have been stolen . 
established clubs like Orrell admit they are already unable to compete , but even bath and Harlequins will be re-examining their sums when their imported league contingent vanish in mid-January . 
the likes of Jason Robinson and Henry Paul have cost around 5,000 pounds ( $ 8,120 ) a match , a major investment considering few club rugby attendances ever hit the 10,000 barrier . 
the end to the dispute over control of the English game certainly owed as much to financial concerns as peace-making , and there are dark whispers of impending bankruptcy for clubs too hasty to jump on the bandwagon . 
for experienced players like Lynagh and Sella the new riches on offer at least represent a well-deserved pay-out at the end of long , distinguished careers . 
but what about the 24-year-old English prospect who finds himself relegated to the second team to accomodate a big name ? 
Saracens supremo Wray insists young Englishmen can only learn from big names , but quality can easily be swamped by quantity . 
it makes it even more ironic to find sell-out crowds anticipating two matches at Twickenham where three-quarters of the players will not be paid a penny . 
the Barbarians , including 13 internationals , play Australia on Saturday , followed by the traditional University match between Oxford and Cambridge next Tuesday , occasions which illustrate the struggle between rugby &apos;s past and future is not yet over . 
&quot; I can &apos;t pretend that we &apos;re not under pressure , &quot; admits Barbarians president Mickey Steele-Bodger . 
&quot; But the Barbarians have never paid players and we hope we never will . 
people play better if they are not being paid , they help each other out . 
the Barbarians &apos; pre-match preparations consists of a cultural night out at Les Miserables , a pleasant change from studying videos of the Wallabies , and post-match drinking is expected to be along traditional lines . 
sadly , there is less and less room for men like Steele-Bodger in wealthy modern rugby . 
even if the meek do inherit the earth , they &apos;ll find dozens of men with cauliflower ears and less-than-perfect English have beaten them to it .
