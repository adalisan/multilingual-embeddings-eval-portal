thieves have stolen a painting by Austrian artist Gustav Klimt , using a fishing line to hook the masterpiece off a gallery wall , a police spokesman said on Sunday . 
the theft was discovered late on Saturday from a modern art gallery in this northern Italian city , but investigators believe the painting , a portrait of a young woman completed in 1917 , was stolen some days earlier . 
the oil painting was last seen on Tuesday and police think thieves fished it off the wall that night , lowering a line and hook from a skylight to pick up the painting . 
the picture frame has been recovered from the roof of the Ricci Oddi gallery . 
no-one noticed the theft at first because the gallery is about to be closed for restoration and a number of paintings had already been taken away ahead of the work . 
guards assumed the Klimt had also been put into store . 
State television said the striking portrait was one of only three Klimts in Italy . 
an art student revealed last year that the painting was originally the portrait of a girl , which was put on show in 1912 but was never seen again . 
art historians assumed the painting had been lost , but a 19-year student discovered that Klimt painted over the original to create the portrait of a woman the year before his death .
