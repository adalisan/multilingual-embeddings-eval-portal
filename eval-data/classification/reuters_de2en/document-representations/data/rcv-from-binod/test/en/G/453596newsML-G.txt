about 40 people were killed and 150 wounded in a huge explosion that rocked the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad on Wednesday , an Afghan agency said . 
the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press ( AIP ) said the mid-morning blast occurred at a police department in a western district of the city on the main road leading to Kabul . 
AIP , based in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar , said the explosion was at an arms dump where the Islamic Taleban militia stored weapons and ammunition collected from former commanders of Afghan Mujahideen guerrilla groups . 
it said Jalalabad hospitals were overflowing with casualties and the city administration had asked civilians to join in rescue work . 
a U.N. official , who asked not to be named , said about 10 houses had been demolished and about 100 damaged . 
many of the dead were women and children , he added . 
unexploded ordnance littered the area , hampering rescue work , and Taleban officials warned people not to touch it . 
AIP said about six Luna ground-to-ground rockets , which have a range of up to 100 km ( 60 miles ) , had exploded , scattering debris over wide areas of western Jalalabad . 
telephone connections between Jalalabad and Peshawar were cut off , apparently as a result of the explosion . 
it was not immediately clear if the blast was accidental or the result of sabotage against the Taleban , who captured the city in September from a group of neutral guerrilla factions . 
a Western military expert said there had been several accidental explosions at ammunition depots in Afghanistan in recent months , caused partly by haphazard storage techniques . 
&quot; There is no separation of ballistic weapons from explosive weapons , or of explosives from detonators , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Unboxed , battle-ready ammunition is simply piled up in heaps . 
he said electrical interference could set off some types of weapon . 
others might be detonated by percussion . 
there were no safeguards to prevent an uncontrollable series of explosions once the conflagration was under way , he added .
