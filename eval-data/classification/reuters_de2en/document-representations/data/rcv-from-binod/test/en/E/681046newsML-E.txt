Britain &apos;s Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is set to deliver up to five billion pounds ( $ 8.3 billion ) of tax rises in his July 2 budget , according to economists at HSBC Markets . 
but chief economist Roger Bootle and UK economist Jonathan Loynes said this will not be enough to appease the Bank of England &apos;s worries over high growth and inflationary pressures . 
they expect at least one interest rate rise to follow the budget unless Brown raises taxes by much more -- at least six or seven billion pounds . 
&quot; Our ( budget ) forecast is above expectations , but perhaps not enough to keep the Bank of England fully at bay , &quot; they said in their Budget preview . 
tax rises are likely to hit the housing and insurance sectors , with changes in corporate taxation also a firm possibility . 
it noted recent press reports suggested Brown would not abolish mortgage interest tax relief ( MIRAS ) . 
&quot; If true this would surely waste a golden opportunity . 
it would be the easiest 2.5 billion pounds he would ever raise , &quot; said the report . 
but doubling the one percent stamp duty on house purchases would also be a simple way to raise cash as well as slowing activity in the buoyant housing market . 
doubling stamp duty would raise 500 million pounds , &quot; but it would need to be introduced immediately in order to avoid a spike in housing activity which would stoke up rather than dampen the immediate pressure on house prices &quot; . 
although the Labour government did not vow during the election campaign to leave the 17.5 percent rate unchanged , a hike in the rate would be against the spirit of the manifesto which severely criticised the previous government for VAT rises . 
income tax-free allowances will probably be left unchanged for the same reason , HSBC said . 
the report said the insurance sector and air travel -- both &quot; unjustifiably lightly taxed &quot; -- may be targeted by the Chancellor . 
&quot; doubling of the current rate of insurance premium tax would raise a tidy one billion pounds per annum . 
the second candidate lightly taxed is air travel . 
not only is it VAT exempt , but airline fuel attracts very low levels of duty . 
they calculate an increase in air passenger duty to 15 stg for UK and EC flights from 10 stg and to 30 stg for elsewhere from 20 stg would raise 400 million stg . 
on the corporate side , a rise in the internationally low corporation tax rate would net 750,000 stg for each one percent increase . 
but the 20 percent tax credit on corporate dividends ( ACT ) is a more likely target . 
if it is abolished completely , it would raise 5.0 billion pounds , while a 50 percent cut would net two to three billion .
