borrowing among British consumers surged by over one billion pounds in May , the Bank of England said on Monday , piling more pressure on the government to raise personal taxes in this week &apos;s budget to cool demand . 
the Bank said consumer credit rose by 1.105 billion pounds ( $ 1.7 billion ) in May compared with a rise of 806 million pounds in April , revised up from 691 million at the first estimate . 
the data , along with more up-to-date Bank figures for June which showed a sharp rise in notes and coins circulating around the economy , confirmed worries that consumers are out spending freely again after a relatively subdued spring . 
&quot; These figures keep the pressure on the Chancellor to raise personal taxes in the budget , &quot; said Simon Briscoe , UK economist at Nikko Securities . 
&quot; And it will push expectations of higher interest rates even higher if Brown fails to add 5.0 billion pounds or more to the personal tax bill . 
the Bank said M0 money supply , a measure of notes and coins in circulation and bankers &apos; deposits , grew by a seasonally adjusted 6.3 percent in the year to June compared with 6.1 percent in May . 
M0 is considered a good indicator of inflation in the future . 
June &apos;s figures suggested the slower growth rate seen early this year may now have come to an end . 
Brown faces a dilemma in his first budget . 
consumer demand is very robust and likely to strengthen even further when the impact of over 30 billion pounds of windfall payments from building society flotations hits home . 
but Labour &apos;s election manifesto promised income tax rates would be left unchanged and also criticised the previous government for hefty rises in indirect tax . 
economists said the corporate sector is likely to bear the brunt of any tax rises as a result , but the personal sector will not be immune and homeowners -- around two thirds of households in Britain -- may be hit . 
&quot; Mr Brown will not want to risk measures that could be seen as a blatant betrayal of the spirit , if not the letter , of pre-election promises , &quot; said Jonathan Loynes , UK economist at HSBC Markets . 
&quot; accordingly he may prefer to focus on special areas and , given that much of the concern over the strength of the consumer sector has centred on the housing market , this looks like an obvious target . 
he said mortgage interest tax relief ( MIRAS ) , a tax break on interest payments on the first 30,000 pounds of a home loan , could be for the chop . 
in addition , stamp duty on property transactions is one percent in Britain , well below the European average , and could well be doubled . 
but these measures may not be enough to stay the newly empowered central bank &apos;s hand . 
its monetary policy committee meets a week after the budget and will announce any change to the 6.5 percent base rate on July 10 . 
financial markets have factored in a half point rise in interest rates by the end of the third quarter , with the most bearish traders forecasting the full fifty basis points coming on July 10 .
