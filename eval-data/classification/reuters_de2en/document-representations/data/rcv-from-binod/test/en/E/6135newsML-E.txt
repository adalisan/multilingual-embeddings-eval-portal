Brazilian industrial output in June rose 0.5 percent from May , and fell 3.9 percent compared with June 1995 , the National Statistics Institute ( IBGE ) said in a statement . 
the slight month-on-month increase in June shows a moderate recovery in industrial production when compared with May &apos;s 0.6 percent drop , the IBGE said . 
industrial production in the first half of 1996 fell 4.6 percent , the IBGE said . 
the recovery in industrial production was also evident when comparing the second quarter of 1996 with the first , according to the IBGE . 
output fell 9.1 percent in the first quarter , but only 0.1 percent in the second quarter . 
&quot; It is to be hoped that the recovery in industrial output will continue in the next few months given an easing in monetary policy which helps increase sales of durable goods , as well as semi- and non-durable goods , &quot; the IBGE said in the statement . 
the IBGE also cited an increase in construction work , especially in public works , as a positive impact on industrial production . 
nine of the 20 sectors covered in the IBGE survey were affected by the upturn in industrial output in June , led by textiles , up 6.4 percent , leather goods , up 6.1 percent , and paper and cardboard , up 3.8 percent . 
the tobacco , pharmaceutical and toiletries sectors showed the biggest declines in production at 16.8 percent , 9.4 percent and 5.4 percent , respectively . 
production of durable consumer goods and non-durable goods rose 1.6 percent and 0.7 percent in June , respectively , the IBGE said .
