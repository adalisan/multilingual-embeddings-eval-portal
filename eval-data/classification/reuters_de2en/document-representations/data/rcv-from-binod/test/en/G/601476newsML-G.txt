these are the leading stories in the Namibian press on Wednesday . 
Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy . 
- The chief of the Kxoe people in Western Caprivi , Kippie George , on Tuesday alleged there was a clandestine operation afoot to try and strip him of his leadership position . 
- Questions have been raised about the state of Namibia &apos;s health services after a person seriously injured in a car accident outside Okahandja , about 70 km north-west of Windhoek , ended up flying out of the back of an ambulance as it sped off to hospital . 
the ambulance further apparently arrived at the scene of the accident very late and had been ill-equipped to cope with the situation since it did not have drips or oxygen . 
- Three men described as hardened criminals on Tuesday escaped from custody while being taken to the magistrate &apos;s court in Windhoek . 
they were in custody awaiting trial since 1995 on charges of armed robbery on a farm . 
- Emergency plans by the government to tap water from the Kavango River have been moved to the long-term following good rains in Namibia this past season . 
the completion of the Eastern Water Carrier to supply the drought-ridden central areas with water is going ahead , however . 
Namibia &apos;s government has assured Botswana that water will not be pumped out of the Kavango River unnecessarily . 
- A group of about 40 workers on Tuesday moved into the core conservation area of buffalo on the eastern shores of the Kavango River in Western Caprivi to start clearing the area for fences . 
enviroment Minister Gert Hanekom , on hearing the news , re-emphasised that no one is allowed to move into the buffalo area and that no permission for such activities had been given . 
according to sources in the area , the order to move into the area 15 kms from the Popa Falls came from Mbukushu chief Erwin Mbambo , who apparently wants to settle 1,00 people there . 
- Francis Sizimbo , an opposition DTA member of the National Council , on Tuesday called on the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation and the New Era newspaper to broaden their coverage or risk losing credibility . 
during the continuing budget debate in the National Council , Sizimbo said the government media was not giving enough coverage to the second house of parliament and should strive to better inform people in outlying areas .
