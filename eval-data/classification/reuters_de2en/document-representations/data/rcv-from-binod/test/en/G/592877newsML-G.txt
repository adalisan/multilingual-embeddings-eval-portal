four people were killed and many injured when two bombs exploded on Friday in the eastern Nigerian city of Onitsha , local newspapers reported on Saturday . 
they said one of the blasts , which occurred within hours of each other , was at the central mosque in the largely Christian city . 
&quot; We were about to recite the verses of the Koran when we heard the huge noise and we started running in different directions , &quot; the independent Guardian newspaper quoted Moslem worshipper Musa Sulaiman as saying . 
it is the first such blast in eastern Nigeria since December when a spate of bomb attacks targeted the military . 
more recent attacks focused on Lagos , until Monday when a bomb went off in the southwestern city of Ibadan . 
police said there were no injuries . 
Military-ruled Nigeria has been in turmoil since 1993 when the army annulled a presidential election designed to restore democracy . 
police blame the opposition NADECO group and its foreign supporters for the explosions , but they deny involvement . 
twelve dissidents including exiled Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka have been charged with treason over the bomb blasts .
