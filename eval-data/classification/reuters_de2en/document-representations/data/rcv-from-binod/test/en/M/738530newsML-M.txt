all five Brent cargoes turning wet on Friday were kept ahead of the five o &apos;clock deadline , traders said . 
Suko and Elf each kept an August 2-4 loader and BP kept an August 3-5 loader . 
Brent cargoes are traded on a paper , or forward market until the 1700 London time deadline on the nearest trading day 15 days before their assigned loading date . 
a trading company is clocked when it is left with a paper cargo which has turned physical after that deadline and therefore cannot be passed on as part of pre-sold paper cargo deals .
