Vietnam &apos;s Politburo on Tuesday spelt out rigourous ethical guidelines for Communist Party members as part of a new offensive against corruption within the country &apos;s sprawling ranks of officialdom . 
the ruling body &apos;s eight-point directive , issued as the notorious Tamexco fraud trial entered its fifth day , called for loopholes for bribery and influence-peddling to be closed off . 
the official army daily Quan Doi Nhan Dan said the directive demanded full declaration of property , transparency in procedures for awarding business contracts and restraint in giving gifts . 
it also urged party cells to work closely with the legislative National Assembly on a new bill to combat graft . 
a draft of the bill suggests that any state or military official found guilty of siphoning off $ 27,000 or more should face execution by firing squad or at least be imprisoned for life . 
this is the fate which could await key defendants in the Tamexco trial if they are found guilty at the end of this week &apos;s court hearing in Ho Chi Minh City . 
several former bank executives were cross-examined on Monday as the court tried to establish how some $ 40 million vanished from Tamexco , a trading company linked to the party . 
the Tuoi Tre newspaper said three of the bankers denied that they had received money from Tamexco &apos;s director , Pham Huy Phuoc , in return for helping him get loans from state-owned Vietcombank and its affiliate , Firstvina Bank . 
Phuoc withdrew a previous statement that he had given cash to the wife of Nguyen Van De , former director-general of Vietcombank , to renovate their house . 
but he maintained that he had put $ 7,000 between the sheets on De &apos;s bed in a hotel while they were on a business trip together in Indonesia . 
&quot; Where was De then ... ? 
&quot; he was asked . 
&quot; In the toilet , &quot; he replied . 
&quot; didn &apos;t De know ? 
&quot; I think he might have seen it ... he might not , &quot; Phuoc said . 
as semi-official newspapers reported the latest murky details of the case , the party daily Nhan Dan revealed that the state budget was losing close to $ 90 million a year through social insurance fraud . 
it said that around 20 percent of people receiving sickness and maternity benefits and pensions were doing so illegally . 
economic crime is said to have become endemic in Vietnam , where millions of state employees are still paid very low wages despite several years of rapid growth . 
the government announced this week that the minimum monthly salary for public servants and public authority employees had been raised by 20 percent to 144,000 Dong ( $ 12.87 ) .
