American sprinter Tim Montgomery was the upset winner of the 100 metres at the Osaka athletics grand Prix on Saturday and promptly declared himself a future world record holder . 
running with wind assistance , Montgomery was the only one of the seven starters to finish in under 10 seconds , beating fellow Americans Leroy Burrell and Jeff Laynes into second and third respectively . 
the brash 22-year-old , who set a personal best of 9.95 seconds , said he believed his best times were still ahead . 
Burrell and Laynes were beaten before the race was half-over as a confident Montgomery flew down the track . 
Olympic silver medallist Frankie Fredericks easily won the 200 metres in 19.90 seconds and said the victory was a boost for his confidence so early in the season . 
the 29-year-old Namibian , whose best time is 19.68 , eased up as he ran home ahead of Americans Kevin Little and Tod Long . 
it is good for my confidence as I prepare for the season , &quot; Fredericks said . 
but despite the win , Fredericks said he was still undecided about whether to run in the 100 metres or the 200 in the world championships in Athens in August . 
Daniel komen put himself in the mood to celebrate his 21st birthday next week with a two-second win over fellow Kenyan Julius Gitahi in the 5,000 metres in a time of 13 minutes 3.51 seconds . 
Britain &apos;s Diane Modahl had a close win in her opening run of the season when she just eased out Jamaica &apos;s Inez Turner in the 800 metres . 
Modahl clocked 2 : 02.79 to Turner &apos;s 2 : 03.05 . 
&quot; I &apos;ve trained very hard since the winter to run well in the world championships in August and today &apos;s race shows that things are going very well , &quot; said Modahl . 
triple jump champion and world record holder Inessa Kravets of Ukraine struggled with her form , losing for the second time in two meetings to the Czech Republic &apos;s Sarka Kasparova . 
Kravets &apos;s best jump of 13.33 metres took her into only fifth place and was well short of her world record of 15.50 . 
Kasparova won with a jump of 14.72 metres .
