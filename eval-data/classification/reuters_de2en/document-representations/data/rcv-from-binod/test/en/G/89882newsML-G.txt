Saudi Arabia &apos;s King Fahd said Israel &apos;s latest actions in Jerusalem not only threatened the Middle East peace process but world stability , the official Saudi Press Agency reported . 
SPA said the king welcomed at a weekly cabinet meeting on Monday night the international support for the Arab condemnation of Israel &apos;s &quot; brutal massacres in Jerusalem . 
he asserted that &quot; it was not in the interest of the world presently or futurely to ignore the Israeli practices which will not only sabotage the peace process but will greatly harm the world &apos;s stability and prosperity . 
he said the international community should &quot; stop the intentional Israeli changes to the nature of al-Aqsa Mosque which aims at suppressing the identity of Islamic holy ( sites ) in a flagrant deviation from international laws and norms . 
the mosque in Jerusalem &apos;s Old City is Islam &apos;s third holiest shrine . 
fifty-five Palestinians and 14 Israelis were killed in violence which erupted after Israel opened an archaeological tunnel near the mosque . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton is hosting a Mideast summit aimed at ending the renewed violence .
