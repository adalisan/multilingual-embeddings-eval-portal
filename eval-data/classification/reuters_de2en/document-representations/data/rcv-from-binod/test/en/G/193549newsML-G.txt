President Bill Clinton said on Friday the United States has agreed in principle to send about 8,500 U.S. troops to Bosnia as part of a new international peacekeeping mission to run through mid-1998 . 
Clinton defended the step as necessary to assure continued peace in Bosnia and denied he intentionally delayed announcing the controversial decision to extend the mission beyond this year until after he was re-elected last week . 
the new international force is expected to total about 30,000 troops and would replace a current NATO-led peace implementation force of 50,000 , known as IFOR , which is being withdrawn from Bosnia . 
this year . 
the United States has 15,000 troops in that force . 
&quot; I have decided to instruct the United States representative to NATO to inform our allies that in principle the United States will take part in a follow-on force in Bosnia , &quot; Clinton told a news conference at the White House . 
&quot; We believe the size will be about 8,500 , &quot; he said of the planned U.S. participation , adding : &quot; There will be an American commander and tough rules of engagement . 
the total would be reviewed every six months and cut in half by the end of 1997 . 
&quot; We will propose to our NATO allies that by June of 1998 , the mission &apos;s work should be done and the forces should be able to withdraw , &quot; Clinton said . 
he added : &quot; For my agreement in principle to become a commitment , I must be satisfied that the final recommendationm NATO adopts and the operational plan it develops are clear , limited and achieveable . 
the decision by the Democratic president to send the troops to a new force was expected to win grudging approval from the newly-elected Republican-controlled Congress . 
Dan coats , Republican Senator from Indiana and a member of the Armed Services Committee , said Clinton &apos;s action on Bosnia reflected the &quot; seat of the pants reactive foreign policy that &apos;s been the plague of this administration &quot; 
but he said in an interview with CNN : &quot; I think there will be a lot of discussion but I think at the end , the president having committed these troops , ( he ) will receive support . 
when he sent the U.S. troops there nearly one year ago , Clinton promised the American people they would be out of Bosnia by the end of this year . 
but he said that although the military mission in the war-ravaged country had been successful , the reconstruction of the administration and the economy had been slower than expected , making a follow-on force necessary . 
&quot; Today , the Bosnian people are far better off than they were a year ago . 
their prospects for peace and freedom are much brighter , &quot; said Clinton . 
&quot; Bosnia &apos;s bitter harvest of hatred , however , has not disappeared . 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana , speaking in Washington shortly after Clinton &apos;s announcement , thanked the president for &quot; such a courageous decision . 
&quot; Solana said earlier he expected the force to total 25,000 to 30,000 . 
Russia and a number of other non-NATO states would continue to take part in the follow-on effort , which would also station about 3,000 German troops in Bosnia . 
although , the United States has begun to withdraw its 15,000 troops in IFOR , it is currently sending in about 7,500 troops to help protect that withdrawal . 
much of that cover force is already scheduled to remain until March and apparently would now become the vanguard of the tentative U.S. commitment to the new force . 
representatives to the North Atlantic Council , the alliance &apos;s political arm , will meet with Solana in Brussels on Monday and are expected to opt for the continuing peacekeeping force over other alternatives , according to NATO officials . 
U.S. Army Gen. George Joulwan , NATO &apos;s military commander , will then seek specific commitments of troops from NATO and other countries to draw up a final plan , which would be given formal approval at separate meetings of NATO foreign and defence ministers in Brussels in mid-December .
