Venezuela faces a challenge in the near future of managing the fiscal consequences of a coming appreciation of the real exchange rate , said Ricardo Hausmann , chief economist at the Inter-American Development Bank ( IADB ) . 
Hausmann , speaking to Reuters late Monday at a seminar in Brasilia on public finances , added Venezuela &quot; was on track &quot; . 
the IADB economist said an exchange rate appreciation will pressure the government &apos;s oil export revenue in domestic terms . 
he said Venezuela &apos;s fiscal accounts were doing well now following its &quot; massive &quot; devaluation of the Bolivar currency and relatively high current oil prices . 
&quot; As inflation erodes the depreciation and oil prices return to more normal levels , the challenge will be to manage the fiscal consequences , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Real appreciation will deteriorate the fiscal accounts .
