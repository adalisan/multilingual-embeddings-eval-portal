U.S. attacks on Iraq were driven by President Bill Clinton &apos;s desire for re-election and allowed him to act tough against the West &apos;s bogeyman without risking a full military campaign , the world &apos;s press said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Clinton &apos;s decision to attack Iraq has more to do with U.S. politics than the Iraqi issue itself , &quot; said an editorial in South Korea &apos;s Joong-Ang Ilbo , summing up general opinion . 
newspapers in many countries agreed Saddam Hussein needed to be taught a lesson for his attacks on Kurds in northern Iraq . 
but they warned Clinton that continued attacks on Iraq could alienate already uneasy allies in Europe and elsewhere . 
diplomacy rather than missiles provided the best solution to problems in the Middle East , newspapers said . 
only U.S. forces were involved in Tuesday &apos;s attack on targets in southern Iraq . 
Britain , Japan and Germany offered support but others were less convinced of the raid &apos;s necessity . 
&quot; Operation Desert Strike fell far short of gaining the unanimous support of Washington &apos;s allies . 
France and Italy drew a clear line between themselves and Washington while Russia and China condemned the American action , &quot; said France &apos;s Le Figaro . 
Clinton &apos;s decision to send in the B52s is , however , sure to go down well with U.S. voters . 
they like tough leaders , seeing their country acting as sheriff of the global village -- and vote for their next president in November , newspapers said . 
&quot; It is ... not surprising that this action appears to many U.S. friends and allies to be driven by specifically U.S. interests and electoral politics , &quot; said the Irish Times . 
if Clinton had not acted &quot; he would certainly have been accused by his domestic opponents of being a &quot; lame duck &quot; , according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung . 
&quot; He showed once more that it is impossible to play tricks on the United States , &quot; Magyar Hirlap in Hungary said . 
but it added : &quot; It would be no surprise if after this attack President Clinton rises in the polls against his challenger Bob Dole . 
many editors warned Clinton that his tough line carried grave risks as Saddam -- described variously as &quot; the emperor of wrong decisions &quot; and &quot; an avid misreader of American domestic politics &quot; -- was totally unpredictable . 
&quot; ( Clinton &apos;s ) decision could enable him to rally his supporters around him , so long as his army does not find itself ensnarled in a long-term conflict with Iraq , &quot; said France-Soir . 
&quot; Saddam ... has gambled before on escalation and may well believe that in mid-election campaign , all he needs is a few body-bags to force American to a humiliating change of course , &quot; the London Times said . 
Poland &apos;s daily Rzeczpospoita noted : &quot; A missile attack is just a show of force . 
President Clinton has no desire to push the U.S. army into larger scale operations just two months before the elections . 
support for the U.S. action in major capitals could also dribble away if Washington carried on alone . 
newspapers were commenting before the second attack on Iraqi targets . 
&quot; If the military action against Iraq escalated , the U.S. would become increasingly isolated in the international community , &quot; the China-backed Wen Wei Po said in Hong Kong . 
&quot; There is worrying unilateralism about it that could contribute to growing tension between U.S. and European governments , despite the support Mr Clinton has received from Britain and Germany , &quot; the Irish Times said . 
Cairo &apos;s Al-Hayat said : &quot; The U.S. is the adversary and arbiter in each confrontation with an Arab or Moslem country . 
&quot; Egypt &apos;s Asharq al-Awsat said Iran , another major concern for the U.S. , could be the winner from the U.S. / Iraq showdown . 
many said the need for a U.S. attack on Saddam showed how well he overcame his defeat in the 1991 Gulf War . 
that chance to alter the West &apos;s relationship with Baghdad had been wasted . 
&quot; It is now clear that the Saddams of this world will not simply be brought to reason by destroying their bridges , their command headquarters and their airports if one is afraid to go through the bloody route all the way to the end , &quot; said Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Germany . 
&quot; Saddam Hussein is really a big threat but the problems cannot be solved with Tomahawks ( missiles ) . 
this is the lesson to be learned , &quot; Nepsabadsag , Hungary &apos;s biggest daily , said . 
the London Guardian said Saddam would have taken a lack of reaction to his incursion into northern Iraq as a sign of weakness by the West . 
&quot; The irony is that the act of launching them reveals a deeper weakness in the ability of the international community to do anything positive for the long term , &quot; it said .
