air raid sirens blared over Baghdad early on Wednesday while most of the four million residents of the capital were still asleep . 
Baghdad streets were almost empty of cars and the dawn silence was broken only by calls of &quot; Allah Akbar &quot; ( God is greatest ) from mosque loudspeakers in the city . 
no anti-aircraft fire was heard and there was no indication whether any of the cruise missiles the U.S. unleashed on Iraq on Wednesday had hit targets close to the capital . 
Baghdad radio had just started programmes with recitals from the Moslem holy book , the Koran . 
there were few people on the streets of Baghdad but none scrambled for cover or even bothered to stop and ask what the sirens were for . 
it was the second barrage of U.S. missiles on air defence targets in southern Iraq . 
on Tuesday the U.S. launced one of the biggest military strikes against Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War . 
the U.S. attack on Iraq followed a thrust by Iraqi armed forces into Kurdish areas in northern Iraq at the weekend , the first military assault on that part of the country which Washington and allies had declared off limits to Iraqi forces . 
Baghdad said its assault was in response to a request from Kurdish rebel leader Massoud Barzani of the Kurdisntan Democratic Party ( KDP ) in a bid to encounter the increasing influence of his pro-Iran rival Jalal Talabani , leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) . 
on Tuesday Iraq vowed not to respect restrictions on flights by its aircraft and ordered its warplanes and anti-aircraft gunners to shoot down U.S. and allied planes policing air- exclusion zones in parts of its north and south . 
on Tuesday Washington extended the southern no-fly zone over southern Iraq , pushing it to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad and also put off the implementantation of the country &apos;s oil-for-food deal with U.N. 
the measures will hurt Iraq &apos;s economy , already battered by six years of U.N. trade sanctions imposed for Baghdad &apos;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
the dinar tumbled against the U.S. dollar and prices of essential commodities soared . 
Iraqis shrugged off U.S. missile strikes , saying their real concern was over the fate of their country &apos;s oil-for-food deal with U.N. 
in Alawi , a Baghdad bus station , soldiers ate sandwiches as vendors and hawkers set canopies over their carts to protect them from Baghdad &apos;s fierce heat during the day .
