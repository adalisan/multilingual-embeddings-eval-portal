new British Prime Minister Tony Blair is considering attending ceremonies marking the handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1 , British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said on Monday . 
Cook , on a one-day visit to Washington , told a news conference he himself would attend and added : &quot; We are exploring the ability of Mr Blair to be present at the handover ceremony . 
Cook was speaking after talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , who announced earlier she would attend the ceremony in a clear sign of U.S. support for the maintenance of civil liberties in the territory under Chinese rule . 
Cook said the Labour government , which took power after defeating the Conservatives in the May 1 election , would honour the previous Conservative government &apos;s commitment to make six-monthly reports on the state of human rights in Hong Kong . 
Cook said he was confident after discussing this issue with Albright and other State Department and Congressional figures that Britain would get U.S. cooperation in following up on those reports . 
he said he stressed with all the U.S. officials he met Britain &apos;s &quot; very strong interest &quot; in Hong Kong after the handover to ensure that China fulfils commitments it has made to maintain civil rights and financial freedoms . 
&quot; We will be looking for United States support to make sure that those agreements with China are honoured , &quot; he said . 
but he said whatever pressure Washington might bring to bear should not include suspension of Beijing &apos;s Most Favoured Nation trading status , which he said was vital for the continued prosperity of Hong Kong . 
&quot; It would not help to protect Hong Kong if any measure was taken by the United States which undermined the economy of Hong Kong , &quot; Cook said . 
President Bill Clinton announced on Monday he was renewing MFN , but intensive debate was expected in the coming weeks in Congress , which has the right to reverse that decision . 
Clinton &apos;s National Security adviser , Samuel ( Sandy ) Berger told reporters after Clinton &apos;s announcement : &quot; Underdcutting the island &apos;s footing at this moment would be a serious blow just at a time when Hong Kong needs to assert its strength and its autonomy . 
he added : &quot; We must support the economic vitality of Hong Kong during this period of transition .
