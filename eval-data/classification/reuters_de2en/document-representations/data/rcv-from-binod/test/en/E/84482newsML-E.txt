Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing on Monday expressed confidence that the Germany &apos;s M3 money supply aggregate would approach the upper level of the central bank &apos;s target of 4-7 percent annual growth . 
&quot; We are confident that over time it will perhaps the upper level of our target , &quot; Issing told Reuters Financial Television but he said it was an open question as to whether the area would be reached by the end of this year . 
Issing said weak monetary capital formation was the main reason for the strong M3 growth . 
on the subject of the German economy , Issing said it has already made a turnaround but it will be key for the momentum to continue through the rest of this year and into next year . 
asked whether monetary policy action would be needed to further stimulate the economy , Issing replied , &quot; For the time being monetary policy has played its role . 
the solution to higher growth is not with the central bank . 
turning to the fiscal situation , the Bundesbank official said hard work was needed for Germany to reach the budgetary criteria required under the Maastricht Treaty . 
however , he added , &quot; The budget for next year is a decisive step in the right direction . 
asked about the levels of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen , Issing said he would not comment on exchange rates .
