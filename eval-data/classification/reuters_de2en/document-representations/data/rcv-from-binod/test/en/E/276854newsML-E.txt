Japan formally approved on Thursday an earlier decision to extend 170 billion yen ( $ 1.5 billion ) in low-interest untied loans to China . 
the loans , announced on Tuesday , were the first tranche in a loan package Japan had pledged to China for the next three years . 
Tokyo has stopped short of resuming grant aid that has been frozen for 17 months because of Beijing &apos;s nuclear testing . 
the loans , to be extended in the fiscal year ending next March , will cover 22 projects , including an expansion of the Beijing airport , the Foreign Ministry said in a statement . 
the loan scheme emphasises environmental projects , agricultural infrastructure and the development of the hinterland areas which have lagged behind China &apos;s booming coastal zones , the ministry said . 
officials from Japan and China exchanged documents on the loans in Beijing , the ministry said . 
Japan had pledged to extend about 580 billion yen ( $ 5 billion ) in yen loans between 1996-1999 , but talks on the provision of the loans had been delayed for several months . 
Japan had sent no missions to approve projects for the package since China conducted a nuclear test in May . 
Japanese officials did not formally say whether China &apos;s nuclear testing affected the timing of the loan provision . 
Japan froze grant aid , worth about seven billion yen ( $ 61.4 million ) , in August 1995 as a mainly symbolic protest at China &apos;s nuclear test programme .
