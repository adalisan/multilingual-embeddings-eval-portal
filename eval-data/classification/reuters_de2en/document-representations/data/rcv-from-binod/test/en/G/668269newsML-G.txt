worries about corruption and restrictions on political freedom temper Hong Kong &apos;s general optimism about its future with China , a poll said on Tuesday . 
sixty per cent of 1,125 adults surveyed by telephone said they were generally upbeat about Hong Kong &apos;s reunion with China from July 1 after Britain hands the territory back . 
while 66 per cent of respondents said they were optimistic about Hong Kong &apos;s future economic performance , only 39 per cent shared a similar optimism about the political future . 
more than a quarter of those surveyed -- 28 per cent -- were pessimistic about the political future . 
the poll was conducted in late May and early June jointly by the Los Angeles Times and the Hong Kong Transition Project , itself sponsored by Hong Kong &apos;s Baptist University as part of an extensive sampling of public opionion on handover issues . 
the results were announced on the same day as Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was quoted in the South China Morning Post as minimising the number of Hong Kong people with handover concerns , identifying them as &quot; less than one per cent of the total population &quot; . 
but Dr Michael DeGolyer , director of the transition project , said the poll results should be a warning to China and the post-handover regime readying to take control of Hong Kong . 
&quot; It &apos;s the government that does not know what &apos;s going with its people that makes serious errors of judgment , &quot; DeGolyer said at a news conference held at Hong Kong &apos;s Foreign correspondents &apos; Club . 
&quot; When you think that everybody in Hong Kong is happy then you figure , well , we can do a few things to make people unhappy . 
&quot; But if you understand better that actually you are working on a very thin base of people who are both patriotic and &apos; excited &apos; ( about the handover ) and that actually there &apos;s a lot of people with-holding judgment or feeling like there &apos;s really no choice about it then you &apos;re going to act a little differently about it . 
the poll showed that 92 per cent of those surveyed felt corruption would affect Hong Kong &apos;s economic prospects after the handover and that 32 per cent had identified it as their most serious concern . 
DeGolyer said that Beijing &apos;s hand-picked Chief Executive for Hong Kong , Tung Chee-hwa , needed to emphasise his government &apos;s anti-corruption posture . 
&quot; Tung Chee-hwa and the incoming ... government have a problem , not with corruption but with the perception and worry and concern about corruption , &quot; the university professor said . 
&quot; Tung Chee-hwa needs to pound his desk , saying no one who is my friend , no one who thinks themselves my friend is going to be allowed to be corrupt in Hong Kong . 
the poll also cited dissatisfaction with the Provisional Legislature appointed by Beijing in place of Hong Kong &apos;s existing , democratically-elected legislature . 
nearly half of those surveyed identified the elected legislature as best protecting Hong Kong people &apos;s interests while only seven per cent named the Provisional Legislature . 
&quot; If the Provisional Legislature lacks credibility as our findings show , then the laws enacted by the Provisional Legislature will probably be challenged by the people of Hong Kong , &quot; said Dr Lo Shiu Hing , also of the transition project and its poll . 
&quot; The decisions made by the Provisional Legislature ... in 1998 will be questioned very seriously .
