pressure mounted on Bulgaria &apos;s beleaguered ruling party on Thursday . 
four leading reformists walked out and an opinion poll after 10 days of street protests put public support for the party at just eight percent . 
the Socialists &apos; parliamentary leader Krassimir Premyanov held out some hope of compromise , saying a new cabinet should &quot; encompass the ideas &quot; of both the Socialists and their parliamentary opponents . 
&quot; Under these circumstances no party would be able to form a single-party cabinet , &quot; Premyanov told state radio . 
but party chairman Georgi Parvanov said on Wednesday the Socialists insisted that their nominee for the premier &apos;s post , Interior Minister Nikolai Dobrev , must lead a new caretaker cabinet until elections at the end of the year . 
more demonstrations in Sofia and around the country were planned for the afternoon . 
four leading members of the party &apos;s reformist wing , Andrei Raichev , Rossen Karadimov , Dimitar Yonchev and Andrei Bundjulov , said they were leaving the party . 
&quot; All those years we were hoping that the Socialist party would restructure itself from a post-communist party to a social democratic party but unfortunately this has not happened , &quot; Yonchev told a news conference . 
we think the best option for Bulgaria is immediate elections and no interim government . 
the Socialists have suggested holding elections by December , a year ahead of schedule . 
Premyanov said the main priority was to form a new government to negotiate new funding agreements with the International Monetary Fund and other lenders and launch a programme to bring Bulgaria out of its economic crisis . 
an opinion poll by the MBMD polling agency , published in the daily Novinar , showed that while the Socialists &apos; support had fallen drastically , support for the opposition Union of Democratic Forces ( UDF ) had not changed since November &apos;s presidential elections . 
&quot; This supports the thesis that the people are on the streets not for political motives but for purely economic ones , &quot; said MBMD director Mira Yanova . 
the Socialist party , political successor to the former Communist party , traditionally has the support of Bulgaria &apos;s large elderly population , and of many people employed by the state or dependent on state subsidies . 
the Socialists won parliamentary elections in December 1994 but last November &apos;s presidential election was won by opposition lawyer Petar Stoyanov , who will be sworn in on Sunday and formally takes office on Wednesday . 
outgoing President Zhelyu Zhelev has refused to ask the Socialists to form a new government in the present atmosphere . 
the task of finding a way forward is likely to be inherited by Stoyanov next week . 
the UDF says it is ready for talks but does not want a new Socialist government be formed under the present parliament -- implying parliamentary polls sooner than the government offers . 
MBMD said only four percent of Bulgarians thought the solution to the crisis was to allow the Socialists to complete their mandate . 
some 44 percent wanted immediate elections and an interim government , while 50 percent wanted talks between the government and opposition and a longer transition . 
&quot; The situation in the country could explode if the Socialists receive a second mandate , &quot; Yanova said . 
after one-hour warning strikes around the country on Wednesday , hundreds of workers rallied at the Stomana-Pernik steelworks to demand early elections . 
even the highly-paid and traditionally pro-Socialist workers of the Kozloduy nuclear plant , which provides 40 percent of the country &apos;s electricity , planned a protest march on Thursday . 
staff at Kozloduy are banned by law from striking .
