recent political uncertainty surrounding Indian markets has cleared but analysts said on Friday they were divided over whether it was the right time for investors to buy stocks . 
leading U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch forecast on Friday that the performance of Indian equities in the next six to nine months could surprise investors , and said it was moving funds into the country from Latin America . 
Merrill said falling interest rates and the likelihood that the 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) federal budget would emerge unscathed from the recent political crisis were both likely to result in healthy economic growth . 
&quot; We are moving funds into the market at the expense of Latin America , &quot; Merrill said in a strategy report titled &quot; As We See It : India on Full throttle &quot; . 
but Rupa Bose , strategist at Paribas Capital Markets in Singapore , urged caution on Indian stocks if Bombay &apos;s benchmark share market index climbs as high as 3,900-4,000 points . 
the widely-tracked 30-share index closed 19.85 points , or 0.52 percent , higher at 3825.57 . 
&quot; With the resolution of the political crisis the market has turned bullish again , &quot; Bose said in a note to investors . 
&quot; We do not think , though , that much upside potential is left in the market , and investors may wish to book profits if the Bomaby Stock Exchange index crosses 3,900 . 
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral won a vote of confidence in parliament late on Tuesday , ending a period of political upheaval following Congress &apos;s surprise decision on March 30 to revoke its support for the 10-month-old United Front government . 
the move by Congress was the death knell for former prime minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda &apos;s leadership . 
analysts said they were worried about poor 1996 / 97 earnings announcements expected from top Indian firms during the reporting season from April to June . 
&quot; Much of this is expected but some investors will always be optimists , and it is unlikely that all the bad news has been factored in already -- especially as the market has focused more on the positives of the budget and the political crisis resolution , &quot; Bose said . 
analysts said the pro-business 1997 / 98 federal budget is now likely to be passed by parliament without major amendments . 
Bose said a recent slowdown in industrial production had dragged on longer than analysts generally expected and could drive down earnings forecasts for 1997 / 98 . 
Rajashekar Iyer , strategist at Kotak Securities , affiliate of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co , said earnings growth forecasts for 1997 / 98 were robust at 26 percent for the 30 stocks comprising the Bombay index -- against just six percent in 1996 / 97 . 
he said the forecasts for the current fiscal year , which began on April 1 , factored in an industrial growth recovery in the early part of the financial year . 
but he said there was not enough evidence that the recovery had begun and added it was not yet reflected in stock prices .
