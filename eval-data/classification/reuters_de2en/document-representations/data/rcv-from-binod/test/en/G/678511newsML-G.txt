Greece &apos;s environment ministry issued a smog warning to Athenians on Thursday after hundreds of people were rushed to hospital with pollution-related ailments . 
&quot; Because weather conditions favouring air pollution are expected to continue tomorrow , the public is urged to limit car transportation and avoid physical labour outdoors , &quot; the ministry said in a statement . 
the medical emergency centre said 708 people had been rushed to hospital in 24 hours by early Thursday , many with respiratory and heart problems or following fainting incidents . 
temperatures have soared to unusually high levels in the Greek capital this week , reaching as high as 40 degrees Celsius ( 104 Fahrenheit ) on Thursday . 
the Greek Meteorological Service said the mini-heatwave would last until Sunday . 
cars are often banned from the centre of Athens , one of Europe &apos;s most polluted capitals , when smog reaches emergency levels . 
the ministry said most pollutants on Thursday were below danger levels and did not order a ban on cars . 
Athens , a city of around four million people , is surrounded by mountains which trap fuel emissions from cars . 
in the summer of 1988 hundreds of people , mostly elderly , died during a heatwave coupled with heavy smog .
