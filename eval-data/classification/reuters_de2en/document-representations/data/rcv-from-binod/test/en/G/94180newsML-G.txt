a woman serving in the U.S. Navy is being held in custody on the Italian island of Sardinia on suspicion of killing her newborn girl , a spokesman for the U.S. Sixth Fleet said on Thursday . 
commander Mike John said petty officer Sharon Yvonne Nelson , 22 , who is single , gave birth late on Monday on board the nuclear submarine maintenance ship , USS Simon Lake , which is permanently stationed in a Sardinian harbour . 
John said Nelson , from the U.S. state of Georgia , had slipped ashore early on Tuesday with the child after the birth . 
her baby was dead when she arrived with her at a hospital in the Sardinian town of Olbia . 
Nelson had not so far been charged with any offence in Italy and U.S. officials had made a formal request to the Italian justice ministry to turn the case over to U.S. jurisdiction , John said . 
they were still awaiting a reply . 
Nelson told U.S. authorities that the child had developed breathing difficulties later the same day . 
police arrested Nelson when she left the hospital and a post mortem was carried out on the baby late on Wednesday . 
the results have not yet been released . 
it was not known if the baby was born prematurely or if Nelson had known that she was pregnant , John added . 
Nelson &apos;s ship has a crew of 1,500 , among them 500 women . 
John said any woman serving in the U.S. navy who knew she was pregnant had to inform her commanding officer immediately . 
&quot; We are conducting an investigation to see if anyone on the ship knew she was pregnant , &quot; John said .
