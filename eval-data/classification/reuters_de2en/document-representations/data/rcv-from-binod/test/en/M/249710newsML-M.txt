Dutch bonds closed sharply weaker on Wednesday , tracking sliding Bund futures amid worldwide asset market nervousness , dealers said . 
with investors scared by recent turbulence and the year-end approaching , trade in the cash market was light , one said . 
&quot; People are being very cautious and nobody wants to stick their neck out just now , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Hopefully trade will pick up , but that seems unlikely before Christmas at least . 
bond markets in the U.S. and across Europe were pummelled by renewed rate worries , despite benign U.S. producer price data today , with Bunds taking out key supports in an early freefall . 
in the Dutch market , activity was largely confined to some switching trades , mainly from January and June 2006 state loans into November 2005s , and further defensive activity at the short end , a broker said . 
guilders outperformed through the day , with the benchmark 10-year yield discount to Bunds moving out from three to five basis points . 
the yield curve continued to steepen at the short end , with the 2-10 year spread widening to 235 basis points from 227 basis points on Tuesday . 
the 5-10 year spread widened less quickly , adding one basis point to 104 . 
the steepening represented more of a tactical move ahead of year-end , than a longer-term shift in investment strategy from Dutch investors , a trader said , with local fundamentals dictating a flattening once jangled nerves had settled . 
U.S. consumer price data due on Thursday are expected to be a focus after a neutral wholesale price report today . 
November headline U.S. producer prices rose 0.4 percent month on month , but the key ex-food / energy component only rose 0.1 percent .
