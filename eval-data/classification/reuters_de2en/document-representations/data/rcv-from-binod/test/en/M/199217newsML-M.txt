Belgian shares slipped to a lower close on Tuesday , under pressure from profit-taking after pushing further into record territory during the morning , but more gains were seen in the weeks to come . 
&quot; The Belgian market has outperformed others in the last few weeks . 
there &apos;s no reason to panic , &quot; one dealer said . 
he was confident the overall uptrend would continue , mainly because of a positive interest rate environment and high liquidity levels with the launch of new index linked funds bringing fresh cash into the market . 
the Bel-20 index ended 5.26 points down at 1,866.91 . 
a firmer dollar and strong start on Wall Street in the afternoon helped limit losses and the Bel-20 remained in a seven point range throughout the session . 
it peaked at a high of 1,873.05 . 
final volume was a reasonable 2.3 billion francs worth of Belgian shares . 
cement maker CBR stood out as the most heavily traded stock in value terms , climbing 2.1 percent to 2,625 francs with 164,843 shares changing hands . 
dealers said the stock was coming in for renewed interest now the December expiry of CBR put warrants - with a strike price of 2,350 francs - was approaching . 
Germany &apos;s Heidelberger Zement issued the warrant in 1993 when it bought 42.4 percent of CBR from Belgium &apos;s Generale Maatschappij . 
Heidelberger has since raised its stake to over 50 percent which it has said is its long-term goal . 
&quot; Now it is supported by good results prospects - the stock is being rediscovered after being forgotten , &quot; one dealer said . 
Cyclicals came under pressure amid concerns about the timing of an economic pickup , with non-ferrous metals company Union Miniere falling 30 francs to 2,170 and steel maker Cockerill Sambre shedding one franc to 115 after touching 114 francs - its lowest level since mid-1993 . 
dealers also noted continued switching out of Cockerill into electronics stock Barco which ended 50 francs higher at 5,320 . 
Cockerill has been depressed for several weeks after the bourse said the steel share could be dropped from the Bel-20 leading share index at the next index reassessment in December and replaced by Barco .
