Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer , in a speech here on Wednesday , reiterated the way the Federal Open Market Committee uses internal forecasts to deduce the optimal timing of Fed policy actions to achieve future price stability . 
Meyer , speaking before the Money marketeers , a grouping of Wall Street economists , presented again the views he had expressed in a speech delivered on January 5 in New Orleans . 
Meyer requested that his remarks on Wednesday night be &quot; off the record &quot; . 
however , he repeated the views he expressed last month on the role of structural macroeconomic models . 
in his January 5 speech , Meyer said : &quot; One of the challenges of monetary policy-making is to ensure that the meeting-to-meeting ( FOMC ) policy deliberations maintain a disciplined focus on the Federal Reserve &apos;s long-term price stability objective . 
he added that monetary policy operates with a lag which &quot; makes it important that monetary policy be forward looking . 
in his previous speech , Meyer described a new economic model the Fed Board staff presents for discussion at FOMC meetings that allows &quot; the FOMC to focus on both the different time-paths to achieve the long-run objective and the alternative paths of output and employment during the transition to the long-run target . 
he stated then that the Fed staff &apos;s model gives a greater weight to &quot; the treatment of expectations &quot; and allows for a focus &quot; on policy options allowing for a more gradual or more rapid convergence over time to long-run inflation targets . 
Meyer also pointed out in his January 5 speech that the forecast the Fed Board &apos;s staff presents before each FOMC meetings has become &quot; fundamentally judgmental , &quot; meaning it integrates a high degree of interpretation of actual data . 
Meyer also noted one major difference between private economists &apos; forecasts and the Fed staff &apos;s forecasts . 
&quot; The staff is projecting how the economy would evolve if there were no change in the federal funds rate , &quot; Meyer said . 
&quot; The rationale for this procedure is to separate the forecast process from the policy making process , and therefore avoid appearing to prejudge the FOMC &apos;s decisions . 
while Meyer acknowledged in his New Orleans speech that there may be exception to this rule , he stressed this &quot; does nevertheless , make the forecast process at the Board fundamentally different from that in the private sector where one of the key decisions in the forecast is the direction of monetary policy . 
Meyer further explained the new Fed model , known as FRS / US , is closely tied to forecasting &quot; rules ( that ) in effect , adjust the real federal funds rate relative to some long-run equilibrium level in response to the gaps between actual and potential output and between inflation and some long-run inflation target . 
the Fed governor noted the importance of such rules -- mainly the one developed by Stanford University professor of economics John Taylor -- when monetary policy is based on an interest rate target as opposed to monetary aggregate targets . 
however , Meyer acknowledged one main problem with such rules -- &quot; that we do not know the equilibrium real federal funds rate and , whatever it might be at one point in time , it likely varies over time . 
in the January 5 speech , the Fed governor added , &quot; there is considerable research under way at the Board in an effort to find specifications and parameters for rules which achieve an efficient balancing of inflation and output variability and provide guidance about patterns and aggressiveness of interest rate adjustments .
