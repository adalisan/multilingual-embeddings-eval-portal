two impressive first half goals gave Russia a comfortable 2-0 win over Israel in a Moscow downpour on Sunday , easing the hosts back to the top of World Cup European qualifying group five . 
just eight minutes into the rain-delayed game , Zaragoza &apos;s Vladislav Radimov latched on to a through ball and stroked his shot coolly past Rafi Cohen in the Israeli goal . 
Haim Revivo had a chance of an equaliser denied by a fine diving save from Sergei Ovchinnikov . 
the Lokomotiv Moscow keeper , on his way to Benfica , read Revivo &apos;s free-kick just right as it curled round the Russian wall . 
a perfectly weighted cross from fast-breaking Igor Yanovsky found Alexei Kosolapov diving spectacularly to head home Russia &apos;s second in the 38th minute . 
the rain did no favours for the recently reseeded dynamo Stadium pitch and the match became bogged down in a series of unforced errors in the second half . 
Russia now lead Israel by a point and also have a game in hand .
