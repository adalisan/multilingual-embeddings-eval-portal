the key September 10-year Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures contract is likely to move around 125.00 on Friday amid a lack of direction . 
the September may rise further above 125.00 after Thursday &apos;s late rally stopped at 124.93 , traders said . 
but slow sales of recently launched long-term corporate bonds will likely put weight on the contract , they said . 
&quot; The contract may challenge an upperside target of 125.04 ( which was Wednesday &apos;s high ) . 
but the topside will be limited unless the remainder of the corporate straights are sold , &quot; said a dealer at a city bank &apos;s securities unit . 
traders said the September is likely to move in a range of between 124.70 and 125.20 after Thursday &apos;s close of 124.89 . 
&quot; There is no other fresh factor than Economic Planning Agency &apos;s release of its monthly economic report today . 
&quot; said a dealer at a trust bank &apos;s securities unit . 
the report could be a bullish factor because it is expected to show stronger signs of an economic recovery , he said .
