the average weekly non-seasonally adjusted value of retail sales in January was 3,040 million stg , 7.1 percent up on January 1996 . 
in value terms , retail sales rose by 6.4 percent in the three months to the end of January on the same period a year earlier . 
in the November to January period the value of sales , unadjusted , by predominantly food stores was 5.2 percent higher than a year earlier , the ons said . 
sales by predominantly non-food stores were up eight percent . 
the near-record 4.6 % year-on-year increase in sales -- the highest since March 1989 -- basically reflects the fact that the performance in January 1996 was poor , the ons said . 
sales fell 1.0 percent on the month in January last year . 
January 1997 was a four-week trading period . 
last January measured a five-week period . 
the measuring periods from November and December 1996 started six days later than in 1995 . 
this had the effect of decreasing the unadjusted value of sales in December compared with a year earlier . 
the effect on January was more neutral . 
Seasonally adjusted data have taken account of that effect . 
the ons said clothing sales have recovered well since December as have furniture sales . 
cosmetics and chemists have improved sales since December and since January 1996 . 
but the ons said the improvement in sales was a fairly general one , rather than confined to specific areas .
