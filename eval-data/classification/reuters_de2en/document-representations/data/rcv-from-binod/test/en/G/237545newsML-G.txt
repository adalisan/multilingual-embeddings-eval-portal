the verdict in the trial of five men accused of murdering three Iranian Kurdish dissidents and their translator in 1992 has been delayed and will not be announced until the end of March , a Berlin court said on Thursday . 
the court granted defence lawyers , who were in the middle of summing up their case , permission to call more witnesses . 
they can be summoned at least until the end of February . 
the trial verdict was originally expected in January and prosecution lawyers have completed their summing up after a trial which has already lasted more than three years . 
four Lebanese men and one Iranian are on trial for the murders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 . 
the trial has led to serious strains in Germany &apos;s relations with Iran , provoking protests at the German embassy in Tehran , Iranian accusations that Germany exerts political influence over its justice system and calls from the Bonn opposition for Germany to curtail exports and diplomatic ties with Iran . 
but Germany , Iran &apos;s biggest European trade partner , has said it aims to maintain ties .
