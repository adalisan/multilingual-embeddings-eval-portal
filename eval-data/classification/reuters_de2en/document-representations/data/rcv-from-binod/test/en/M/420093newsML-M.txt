U.S. mortgage-backed securities languished slightly lower through much of the Wednesday session but perked up modestly late in the day , mortgage experts said . 
&quot; mortgages are going to follow treasuries , and treasuries came up a little higher in the long end , &quot; said Cynthia Rivera , mortgage analyst at BZW Securities . 
light selling prevailed early , but short-covering in treasuries boosted both markets later , analysts said . 
overall , mortgage-backeds were unchanged to 2 / 32 higher , rebounding after being off 1 / 32 to 3 / 32 . 
in key coupons , Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5-percent paper was up 1 / 32 at 99-21 / 32 , yielding 96 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note . 
comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues were up 1 / 32 as well , at 99-20 / 32 and 99-26 / 32 , respectively . 
the 10-year Treasury note was up 5 / 32 at 97-20 / 32 to yield 6.58 percent . 
traders said quiet should pervade on Thursday as well , as market players await Friday &apos;s report on February employment . 
&quot; Between now and Friday it will mostly be waiting , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Friday &apos;s the big deal this week .
