Sampdoria are flying high in Serie A after their dramatic 10-man win over AC Milan at the San Siro but , back at their Bogliasco training ground , the club flag remains mysteriously furled . 
Superstituous ground staff have not touched the pennant since Sampdoria fought back from 3-1 down to defeat Inter at the same stadium last December . 
the club have not lost since and , after Sunday &apos;s miraculous recovery only supporters of city rivals Genoa would dare raise the Sampdoria emblem . 
trailing 2-1 to last year &apos;s champions with 15 minutes to go and just 10 men on the field , the visitors won with late goals from Yugoslav Sinisa Mihajlovic and Marco Carparelli . 
with 19 points from their last seven matches , Samp are now just two points adrift of league leaders Juventus and have firmly established themselves as championship contenders . 
&quot; Juventus would make an enormous error to underestimate the Sampdoria threat , &quot; wrote Milan daily &quot; Corriere della Sera &quot; , under the headline &quot; Cyclone Samp . 
for the superstituous , who believe some teams have their names written on trophies before a ball is kicked , there are striking similarities between the current Sampdoria team and the 1990 / 91 version that won the club &apos;s only Serie A title . 
in 1990 / 91 , the team &apos;s success was built on the prolific &quot; terrible twins &quot; partnership between Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Mancini . 
in the 1996 / 7 version of Sampdoria , Vincenzo Montella and the veteran Mancini have together scored 25 goals , spearheading the most prolific attack in Serie A -- 40 goals in 19 matches . 
in another sign of destiny , Sunday &apos;s victory was the first time Sampdoria had beaten Milan on their own ground since their championship-winning season . 
then , like now , the Genoa club also completed a Milan double , defeating both Milan and rivals Inter at the San Siro . 
&quot; It &apos;s not possible to win twice at the San Siro in a season and not have the chromosomes of a great side , &quot; wrote sports daily &quot; La Gazzetta dello Sport &quot; . 
but key members of Sampdoria &apos;s young side may leave at the end of the current season . 
French midfielder Christian Karembeu is caught up in a transfer tussle between Real Madrid and Barcelona , Mancini has been linked with Inter and Lazio , while Mihajlovic , now perhaps the most accomplished sweeper in Italy , looks set for a big money move . 
worse still , the side &apos;s Swedish mentor , coach Sven-Goran Eriksson , is also poised to depart - for England &apos;s Blackburn . 
when Sampdoria ground-staff do eventually find the courage to raise the club flag , it will probably be at half-mast in mourning of the break-up of a great team . 
at Milan , the post-mortems have already started as the champions dropped to 12th place in Serie A , their worst position at this stage of the season since 1981 / 2 -- a year in which they were relegated . 
brought in to replace manager Oscar Washington Tabarez in December , former Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi now has a worst record than his predecessor : won three , drawn one , lost four . 
&quot; Milan was already ill , &quot; wrote Gazzetta , &quot; Tabarez &apos;s medicine failed to work . 
Sacchi &apos;s is even more frightening . 
against Sampdoria , Sacchi &apos;s defence conceded three goals for the third time in four outings - a record that left onlookers puzzled over the coach &apos;s last minute decision to drop first-choice goalkeeper Sebastiano Rossi . 
his replacement Angelo Pagotto immediately set about disproving Sacchi &apos;s famous comment that &quot; goalkeepers don &apos;t matter &quot; , miscontrolling Francesco Coco &apos;s backpass after just 50 seconds to gift Mancini his 13th goal of the season . 
then , with Milan leading 2-1 and seemingly in control , Pagotto stood rooted to the spot as Mihajlovic &apos;s curling free kick sailed over his head and into the net . 
critics were also puzzled by Sacchi &apos;s decision to replace the injured George Weah , a striker , with Michael Reiziger , a defender , at a time when Milan &apos;s one-man advantage was starting to show . 
&quot; This was a defeat that will weigh heavy on us , &quot; said Liberian Weah , who scored both Milan &apos;s goals in his comeback match after a six-week injury-enforced lay-off . 
&quot; It makes you want to give-up football . 
Milan supporters could be forgiven for hoping their team &apos;s manager has similar thoughts .
