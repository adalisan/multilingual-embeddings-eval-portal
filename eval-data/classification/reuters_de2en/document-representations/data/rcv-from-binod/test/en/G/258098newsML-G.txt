Alexander Mogilny and Pavel Bure , reunited for just the second time this season , combined for five goals and Corey Hirsch stopped 42 shots for his second shutout as the Vancouver Canucks belted the blues 8-0 . 
Mogilny recorded his first hat trick of the season and Bure snapped out of a scoring slump with two goals and three assists , helping Vancouver ( 15-14-1 ) break a three-game skid . 
&quot; It &apos;s all a matter of timing . 
some days they go in and some days they don &apos;t , &quot; Mogilny said . 
&quot; We got a lot of open ice , so we don &apos;t want to get carried away with this . 
&quot; They left Grant Fuhr all by himself . 
it wasn &apos;t really his fault . 
it &apos;s kind of sad . 
the blues ( 15-16-1 ) suffered their fifth straight home loss and their worst shutout defeat since an 8-0 whitewash at the hands of the Boston Bruins in March 1974 . 
&quot; We have to come to a realisation , hopefully sooner than later , that we have to have a commitment from our best players , &quot; said St Louis coach Mike Keenan . 
&quot; We didn &apos;t get much from our best players , including Brett Hull . 
right now , they &apos;re not dedicated . 
&quot; The future of the team is questionable , not very bright . 
in Ottawa , Andy Moog recorded his third shutout of the season and Mike Modano and Richard Matvichuk scored shorthanded goals 26 seconds apart in the second period as the Dallas Stars blanked the sputtering Ottawa Senators 4-0 . 
Moog turned aside 23 shots from the hosts and got a lot of help from his defence , who made sure the Senators did not have many rebound opportunities . 
Dallas improved to 18-10-3 as the Senators sank to 8-14-7 . 
at Florida , Bill Lindsay &apos;s shorthanded tally snapped a second-period tie as the Florida panthers squandered a three-goal lead before defeating the Edmonton Oilers 6-3 breaking a three-game winless streak . 
Tom Fitzgerald , Scott Mellanby and Radek Dvorak each had a goal and an assist for Florida ( 18-6-7 ) , who are unbeaten in their last six home games ( 4-0-2 ) . 
&quot; It was 3-3 from 3-0 and we had the power play , but they got the shorthanded goal . 
the gas came out of us . 
we felt on the bench that that was the backbreaker , &quot; said Edmonton &apos;s Doug weight . 
in Chicago , Keith Carney scored his first goal of the season with 72 seconds left in the game and the Chicago Blackhawks stopped the surging Pittsburgh penguins &apos; 11-game unbeaten streak with a 2-1 victory . 
the loss also snapped Pittsburgh &apos;s six-game winning streak . 
the penguins completed a road trip at 3-1 . 
&quot; Overall , I &apos;m happy with the road trip , &quot; Pittsburgh coach Ed Johnston said . 
&quot; We didn &apos;t take enough chances to win today . 
Carney took a wrist shot from the top of the left faceoff circle and the puck found the top right corner of the net . 
penguins right wing Jaromir Jagr , who leads the league with 30 goals , had his 13-game points streak halted , and defenceman Kevin Hatcher had his eight-game streak stopped . 
in Detroit , Brendan Shanahan , Darren McCarty and Sergei Fedorov had goals on consecutive shots in a 2 : 04 span in the second period to break a scoreless tie and lift the Detroit Red wings to a 3-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs . 
Detroit blistered Felix Potvin with 52 shots , but Potvin kept the Leafs in the game by stopping all 24 shots he faced in the opening period before Shanahan broke through on the power play for his 17th goal at 7 : 16 of the second . 
McCarty scored 82 seconds later and Fedorov completed the spurt with a shorthanded tally at 9 : 20 . 
Potvin finished with 49 saves yet Toronto suffered its league-leading 20th loss . 
in Philadelphia , Ron Hextall turned aside 28 shots and Shjon Podein and Trent Klatt scored first-period goals as the Philadelphia flyers posted their second straight shutout , 6-0 over the Boston Bruins . 
Boston lost their fourth in a row . 
Hextall made six saves in the first period , 13 in the second and nine in the third for his second shutout of the season and 16th of his career .
