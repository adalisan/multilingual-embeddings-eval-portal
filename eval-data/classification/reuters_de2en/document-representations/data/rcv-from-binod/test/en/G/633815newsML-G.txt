former army chief Ehud Barak , triumphant in a contest for the leadership of Israel &apos;s opposition Labour party , vowed on Wednesday to defeat embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the next general election . 
hundreds of supporters greeted Barak , 55 , at his headquarters near Tel Aviv after exit polls pointed to a landslide victory , chanting &quot; Look who &apos;s coming , it &apos;s the next prime minister &quot; . 
&quot; This is a first step towards hope , the first step towards renewal , the first step on the path to victory which will return us to the leadership of this country , &quot; Barak said . 
he captured twice as many votes as second-place contender Yossi Beilin , according to the polls , in a milestone contest for Labour that marked a passing of the political torch from former prime minister Shimon Peres , 73 , and his slain predecessor , Yitzhak Rabin . 
Barak is expected to face Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a general election in 2000 , but some party members hope he can oust the right-wing leader sooner . 
Netanyahu edged out Peres in an upset election victory in 1996 , in part by characterising the Nobel peace laureate as soft on security . 
&quot; I wish all the candidates success and hope Labour voters pick an opposition leader who will remain such for many years , &quot; Netanyahu said earlier on Tuesday . 
labour Party election committee chairman Eli Dayan said an early general election was possible &quot; if we will see some crisis in the coalition &quot; . 
opinion polls have shown Barak neck and neck with Netanyahu , 47 , whose first year in office has been battered by crises on the Middle East peacemaking front and clouded domestically by allegations of corruption . 
Israel Television &apos;s exit poll gave Barak 57 percent of the vote compared with 28 percent for Beilin . 
channel Two &apos;s poll showed 56 percent support for Barak with 26 percent of the votes going to Beilin . 
&quot; If these will be the real results , this is truly a good showing for ( candidate ) number one but also a nice showing for number two , &quot; Beilin told reporters , conceding defeat . 
about 70 percent of the 167,000 registered Labour Party members cast their ballots , Israel Television said . 
the heavily favoured Barak has cast himself as heir to Rabin &apos;s warrior-turned-peacemaker mantle . 
he stands to become only the third Labour party leader since 1973 . 
Rabin &apos;s widow , who endorsed Barak in the contest , was beaming at Labour party headquarters when results of the exit polls were announced . 
&quot; Besides respecting him and believing in his intellectual capacity , I voted for him because I see him as the winner and I want Labour to win , win , win , &quot; she told reporters . 
Barak vowed to work with the other candidates , declaring : &quot; We are all one camp &quot; . 
Beilin , Barak &apos;s main competitor , is the bookish prophet of Labour peace policies and Peres &apos;s long-time protege . 
candidate Shlomo Ben-Ami , 53 , a Moroccan-born novice politician with roots both in academia and among the disadvantaged , came in third with 11 percent . 
Ephraim Sneh , 52 , a physician and brigadier general before he served Rabin and Peres as health minister received seven percent of the vote , according to the Israel Television poll . 
Barak joined Labour two years ago after shedding the uniform of Israel &apos;s most decorated soldier . 
long before entering public life , Barak was a near-legendary military figure , at one point serving as Netanyahu &apos;s commander in an elite commando unit . 
the military credentials helped catapault self-described centrist Barak to prominence in a country where security remains the paramount -- if not the sole -- issue in election campaigns .
