Britain will release on Tuesday a 23-page official report on the fate of Nazi gold , which was hidden in Swiss bank vaults , after the end of World War Two . 
a spokesman for the Foreign Office said the report will be accompanied by a reply from Foreign Secretary Michael Rifkind to member of parliament Greville Janner whose pressure forced the government to undertake an inquiry . 
&quot; The memorandum basically sets out the current availability and sources which relate to information from British archives on Nazi gold , &quot; the spokesman said . 
it would be up to Janner to decide whether to release the contents of the reply , he said . 
documents declassified by the United States national archives in May show that after the capitulation the Swiss were left holding German gold , much believed to have been stolen from Jews and estimated to be worth $ 2.5 billion at today &apos;s prices . 
the United States , Britain and France believed that a majority , and possibly all of it , was looted . 
a letter from the Swiss legation in Washington in 1946 , suggests the three Allies agreed to a secret deal over the gold which effectively divided the cash raised by any sale of the gold amongst all four countries . 
Janner , a member of parliament for the main opposition Labour Party , wrote in June to Rifkind and the Defence Secretary , Michael Portillo , asking whether British intelligence had any documents about this secret deal 
Rifkind wrote back that &quot; none of the intelligence services is aware of having such information &quot; . 
but he subsequently agreed to set up an inquiry into the claims . 
the documents are among thousands from the files of &quot; Operation Safehaven &quot; , a U.S. intelligence effort just after the war that tried to find out how Germany used Switzerland , Sweden and other neutral countries to hide its assets . 
Janner , a leading member of the Jewish community , was unavailable for comment . 
he was reported in weekend newspapers as saying that Britain knew a lot about the fate of Nazi gold . 
&quot; I believe there will be no cover-up and that we have a moral obligation to hand back what is not ours , and what was stolen , &quot; he told the Independent on Sunday . 
&quot; We must accept it does not , never did , belong to Britain .
