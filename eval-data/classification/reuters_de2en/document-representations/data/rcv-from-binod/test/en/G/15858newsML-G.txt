veteran Italian Gianni Bugno has been cleared of doping after testing positive for high levels of testosterone during the Tour of Switzerland in June , the Italian cycling federation said on Tuesday . 
&quot; He has been cleared . 
the case is closed , &quot; a spokesman said . 
Bugno tested positive for the banned hormone after the fifth stage of the Tour , in which he finished third overall . 
but the spokesman said subsequent tests in Cologne proved his body produced higher-than-average testosterone levels naturally . 
Bugno , who won the Giro d &apos;Italia in 1990 and two successive world titles , was banned for three months in 1994 after testing positive for the stimulant caffeine .
