the Industrial Finance Corp of Thailand ( IFCT ) on Thursday projected Thai exports to grow 8.00 percent in 1997 against a 0.2 percent contraction in 1996 and a 23.6 percent increase in 1995 . 
an IFCT report said , however , that the expected export improvement would not be sufficient to offset slowdowns in other economic sectors , or prevent gross domestic product growth from declining to 5.9 percent this year from 6.4 percent in 1996 . 
&quot; A gradual export recovery will contribute positively to an overall economic growth but will not be enough to offset a sharp slowdown of the government expenditure , private consumption and investment , &quot; said the industrial financing bank . 
the 5.9 percent expected GDP growth , in line with a projection made by the central bank this week , would be the smallest in a decade . 
the Thai government has cut budget spending slated for the current and 1997 / 1998 ( October / September ) fiscal years while the central bank &apos;s private investment index in February posted its lowest year-on-year growth since August 1992 . 
IFCT &apos;s 1997 export growth projection was more bullish than a 7.2 percent increase estimated this week by the Bank of Thailand . 
it said first quarter Thai export growth of 1.5 percent year-on-year reflected a major improvement from performance in the second half of 1996 , when exports contracted four percent . 
&quot; If this positive trend extends to the rest of the year , export growth will register a high single digit growth ... to be on the conservative side , we estimated that export will grow 8.0 percent in 1997 , given the positive outlooks of Thailand &apos;s major trading partners &apos; economies .
