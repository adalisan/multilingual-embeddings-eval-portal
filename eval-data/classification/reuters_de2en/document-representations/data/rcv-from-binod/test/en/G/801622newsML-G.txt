DUNEDIN , Aug 15 - The All Blacks , undefeated this season , have yet to take a leading role at the start of any of their 1997 tri-series rugby tests . 
in fact , they &apos;ve had cold starts in all three matches , played catch-up rugby but eventually won , mostly by comfortable margins . 
at Ellis Park they trailed the Springboks 3-0 , 10-0 and 23-7 before the 35-32 triumph . 
down 3-0 within a few minutes at the MCG , the All Blacks clawed their way back to win 33-18 against the Wallabies . 
last week at Eden Park they resolved not to concede a penalty in the first 10 minutes but gave the first away in 10 seconds . 
they were behind 7-0 then 21-11 before belting the South Africans 55-35 , a record between the countries . 
&quot; That got them right into the game , put us on the back foot -- we have to address that , &quot; All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick said of the first penalty against them . 
all Black coach John Hart said the team had continually spoken about the slow starts , resolved to turn the heat on from kickoff but never quite got the fire going until later in the game . 
&quot; It &apos;s one of our goals for this match , to begin well , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s a problem we &apos;ve talked about this week , last week , the week before , and so we &apos;re still taking about it , &quot; he said .
