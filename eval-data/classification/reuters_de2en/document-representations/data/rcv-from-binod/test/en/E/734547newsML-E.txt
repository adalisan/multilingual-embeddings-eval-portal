Finnish economic data reported on Tuesday was in line with the trend and did not warrant tighter monetary policy , daily Turun Sanomat on Wednesday quoted Bank of Finland board member Matti Vanhala as saying . 
may core inflation , the central bank &apos;s chief gauge for monetary policy , rose 0.3 percent on April and 0.5 percent year-on-year . 
&quot; The reported inflation data including background information -- as well as the production data -- are in line with previous , &quot; Vanhala told the paper . 
the average forecast from six economists for year-on-year CPI rise had been for a 1.1 percent increase and core inflation was seen up 0.4 percent , though forecasts ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 percent . 
the central bank &apos;s target is for a rise of no more than around two percent year-on-year in core inflation . 
industrial production also reported on Tuesday rose 6.1 percent year-on-year , below the 6.7-8.3 percent range of forecasts which averaged 7.4 percent . 
Vanhala said this data would not give reason to tighten monetary policy , but added that the central bank &apos;s assessment may change later . 
&quot; This does of course not change the fact that there has been a strong growth trend in Finland for a long time , capacity utilisation is on the rise , demand is increasing , and it may indeed be that we would have to change the assessment of the situation at some stage , &quot; he said . 
the Bank of Finland warned in mid-June that if may have to tighten monetary conditions if risks of accelerating inflation increased .
