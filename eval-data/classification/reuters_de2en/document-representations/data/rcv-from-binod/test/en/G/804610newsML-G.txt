Singapore is worried by the rapidly increasing number of people over the age of 65 and the problems it will raise for the small island-state , Health Minister Teo Cheow Tong said on Sunday . 
Yeo said in a speech before medical specialists that Singapore now has 210,000 people over the age of 65 in a population of 3.1 million people . 
&quot; By the year 2020 , we will have about 530,000 elderly , or 13 percent of the population , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What is worrying is that , arising from the post-war baby boom , the number of elderly will increase even more rapidly after that . 
Singapore &apos;s elderly population is projected to rise to 800,000 by 2030 . 
&quot; They will then make up over 18 percent of the total population , &quot; Yeo said . 
&quot; It has complex social , economic and health dimensions . 
experts have said the problem may be even more acute in Singapore because of its smaller population base compared with its neighbours like Indonesia , which has a population of nearly 200 million people . 
one way Singapore is trying to cope is to raise the retirement age , Yeo said . 
beginning in January 1999 , the retirement age will be increased to 62 years from 60 . 
Yeo said &quot; the longer term plan of eventually raising it to 67 years , &quot; the Health Minister said . 
&quot; Employment gives the elderly person a sense of worth , dignity and financial independence . 
Yeo did not elaborate on his remarks but said Singapore needed to identify the most efficient and effective way to meet the health care needs of the elderly . 
putting the elderly in institutions is not a solution because &quot; it is difficult to replicate the warm emotional environment and support of their own family settings , &quot; he said . 
the number of nursing home beds is expected to rise to around 7,000 by the year 2000 from the current 4,400 .
