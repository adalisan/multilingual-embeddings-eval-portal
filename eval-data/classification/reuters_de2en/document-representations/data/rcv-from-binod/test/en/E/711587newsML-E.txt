Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio said on Monday that despite very low inflation in France , Germany and Italy the outlook for economic growth was very uncertain . 
&quot; In France , Germany and Italy inflation is very low but growth is very uncertain , &quot; Fazio told reporters . 
he was attending a monthly meeting of Group of Ten ( G10 ) central bank governors . 
&quot; What is putting a break on investments is the excessive tax burden and excessive regulation above all of labour , &quot; he added , apparently referring to all three countries . 
&quot; While there is a willingness to save there is an incapacity of the system , either public or private , to use it ( savings ) , &quot; he added . 
earlier Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer , who chaired the meeting at the Bank for International Settlements , told reporters that structural rigidities in European labour markets were the cause of high unemployment .
