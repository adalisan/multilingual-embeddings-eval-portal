the main suspect in one of Germany &apos;s most spectacular political killings was released on Friday evening and a long-standing arrest warrant lifted , hours after turning himself in , justice officials said . 
Christoph Seidler , whose face appears on wanted posters in every post office and police station in Germany , had been sought for the 1989 car-bomb killing of Deutsche Bank chief executive Alfred Herrhausen . 
Seidler spent the day on Friday facing questioning by an investigating judge , the Federal Prosecutor &apos;s office said . 
&quot; After extensive questioning , the investigating judge has lifted the arrest warrant that was issued on January 10 , 1992 because he is not a primary suspect , &quot; the prosecutor &apos;s office said in a statement . 
although he is free , investigations are continuing into Seidler &apos;s possible role in the Herrhausen killing . 
Seidler , now 38 , is one of the last members of the Red Army Faction ( RAF ) who was still at large . 
he says he was in Lebanon at the time of the killing , which shook Germany only weeks after the burst of euphoria following the fall of the Berlin Wall . 
earlier this month , Seidler told Der Spiegel magazine he hoped to clear his name by giving himself up . 
the attacks of the 1970s and 1980s , carried out at a time of left-wing intellectual ferment and the East-West tension of the superpower arms race , claimed over 50 lives and forced Germany to turn its institutions into virtual fortresses .
