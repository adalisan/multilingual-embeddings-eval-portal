volatile Indian stock markets are expected to stabilise this week as fiscal year-end dampeners give way to renewed hope , but fresh demand will be slow , brokers said . 
&quot; I think the market has absorbed the after-shocks , &quot; said Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ) member-broker Ajit Ambani , referring to a sell-off by speculators after anticipated foreign demand failed to materialise following a pro-business budget . 
&quot; The market should stabilise , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I &apos;m telling my clients to hold their fire ... there &apos;s no hurry to sell . 
the BSE &apos;s top-30 share index finished 15.11 points , or 0.40 percent , off at 3,730.20 last week after dipping to 3,689.07 . 
the index had soared nearly 16 percent to an eight-month high of 4,029.56 in early March from a pre-budget close of 3,474.79 on February 28 . 
the government unveiled its 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) budget after the market close on February 28 . 
this week &apos;s trading account at the BSE is the first for the fiscal year beginning April 1 and this is likely to help buyers , traders said . 
&quot; This will not clash with ( fiscal ) year-end accounts closures . 
the 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) budget cut corporate and personal taxes , raised foreign portfolio limits in firms and allowed companies to buy-back their shares . 
brokers described the budget as &quot; a pleasant surprise &quot; and it triggered frenzied speculative bidding , but the sharp rise in prices drove foreign funds to the sidelines . 
&quot; There &apos;s no catalyst to drive the market up , &quot; said Ajay Parmar , research head at brokerage Mafatlal Securities Ltd . &quot; We feel the market will trade in a 100 points minus or plus zone . 
foreign portfolio investments in 14 Indian firms have reached the ceiling of 24 percent , the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) said on Saturday . 
in six other firms , fresh foreign fund buying requires the RBI &apos;s prior approval because their holdings have reached the &quot; alert &quot; limit of 20 percent , it said . 
no new foreign investments will be allowed in State Bank of India because the government had given an undertaking to keep the limit at 20 percent , which has already been reached , when the bank made a $ 400 million global depositary receipts ( GDRs ) offering last year , the RBI said . 
the budget move to raise the foreign portfolio limits to 30 percent from 24 percent will become effective only in April after parliament accepts the proposal , an RBI official said . 
Carry-forward interest rates at the weekend averaged a normal 2.0 percent a month against 3.5 percent a week ago . 
this indicated that market players have reduced their overbought positions , dealers said . 
an inevitable increase in government-fixed prices of petroleum products will however discourage buyers . 
&quot; That &apos;s one uncertainty that has dogged the markets , &quot; said Ambani . 
&quot; When it comes , the market will take a beating . 
most companies are expected to report a profit-squeeze for the year ending March 31 , but traders are unsure how bad the results would be . 
&quot; We think that buyers would get better valuations if they wait a little , &quot; said Parmar . 
&quot; The index could slide to 3,500 . 
foreign funds are being seen lured by a $ 570 million GDRs offering by government-run overseas telecommunications monopoly Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd . 
the GDR issue is scheduled to be priced on Monday , and merchant bankers say it has been oversubscribed three times .
