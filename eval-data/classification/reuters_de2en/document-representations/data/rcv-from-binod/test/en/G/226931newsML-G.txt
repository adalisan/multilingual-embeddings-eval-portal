France won one of the most exciting Davis Cup finals in history on Sunday as Arnaud Boetsch survived three match points to overcome Stefan Edberg &apos;s stand-in Nicklas Kulti and take the deciding five-set rubber 7-6 2-6 4-6 7-6 10-8 . 
it was the first time since the Davis Cup began in 1900 that the decider had gone to five sets and the 3-2 defeat of the Swedes followed more than nine hours of gripping tennis with the two reverse singles going the full distance . 
after such a display of high quality tennis , no-one deserved to lose and the exhausted Kulti , in tears , was comforted by Edberg as the French team danced with joy . 
Edberg , veteran of more than 10 years of Davis cup campaigns , said : &quot; I was lucky to have been here today . 
it was the most exciting Davis Cup match I &apos;ve ever been too . 
the trophy is France &apos;s second against the odds in five years . 
under Yannick Noah &apos;s charismatic leadership they upset the mighty United States in Lyon in 1991 and Noah brought them to Sweden as underdogs again . 
but Sweden &apos;s fortunes suffered just six games into the first match on Friday when Edberg fell , twisted his ankle and went on to lose to Cedric Pioline . 
Edberg , playing his last competition before retiring , was forced to pull out of Sunday &apos;s decisive match , forcing Kulti into the limelight . 
towards the end the Swede was suffering from bouts of cramp , but fought all through like a lion , to the delight of a near ecstatic crowd . 
he lost the first set to a calculating Boetsch who forced him to stick to the baseline , unable to play a serve and volley game . 
it was a close run thing , however , although Boetsch won the tie-break 7-2 . 
Kulti , who has not beaten Boetsch in three meetings , fought back using his whipping serve to great effect . 
after see-sawing fortunes and a second tie-break won 7-5 by Boetsch , Kulti , ranked 32 places below the Frenchman , earned three match points at 40-0 in the 14th game of the final set , but he was unable to convert them . 
Boetsch , using all his cool and speed round the court , hung on with some fine serving before breaking the Swede in the 17th game and serving for the match , clinching the cup on the third of his three match points . 
earlier , top Swede Thomas Enqvist won another nerve-sapping five-set marathon against Cedric Pioline 3-6 6-7 6-4 6-4 9-7 to keep Sweden in the tie after France had clinched Saturday &apos;s doubles . 
&quot; That was the longest match of my career , &quot; Enqvist said afterwards . 
&quot; And probably the most emotional . 
it was the first time in 11 years that the final remained undecided until a fifth match and the converted factory housing the tie erupted in noisy Gallic celebration . 
Noah hoisted Edberg , winner of six grand slams in a 14-year professional career , on to his shoulders and carried him round the arena to wild applause . 
&quot; However happy we are , we will not leave without the whole team voicing our respects and appreciation for Stefan , for all he has done , &quot; Noah said . 
Noah described the final rubber as &quot; beautiful &quot; but said his dreadlocks had grown a few more white hairs .
