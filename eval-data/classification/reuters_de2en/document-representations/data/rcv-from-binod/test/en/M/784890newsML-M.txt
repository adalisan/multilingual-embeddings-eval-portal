strong intervention , apparently orchestrated by the central bank , in the final seconds of Thursday &apos;s trade pulled the Taiwan dollar back from the brink of another nine-year closing low , dealers said . 
the central bank declined to confirm or deny whether it had intervened to defend the Taiwan dollar . 
&quot; No central bank in the world will tell you if there is any intervention , &quot; a central bank official told reporters after the market closed . 
&quot; Go and ask the market , &quot; the official said . 
the answer was yes , dealers said . 
with greenback buying heavy throughout much of the session , some dealers had predicted the central bank would step in and intervene in defence of the local dollar . 
&quot; U.S. dollar buying is very heavy , but I don &apos;t think the central bank will allow such a sharp depreciation , &quot; one dealer said just before the final flurry of greenback selling . 
&quot; There is still one minute left , let &apos;s wait and see . 
sure enough , the sagging rate promptly rose -- a dramatic reverse that dealers said had all the earmarks of intervention . 
dealers said the central bank &apos;s dramatic move was a clear attempt to rein in offshore speculators , who had been buying U.S. dollars in the form of non-delivery forward trading . 
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that the central bank was punishing those offshore speculators -- who were perceived as the abnormal factors by the central bank , &quot; the dealer said . 
&quot; The central bank had repeatedly said it would intervene when abnormal factors occur . 
its determination is unquestionable , &quot; the dealer said . 
the bank has said a Southeast Asia-style currency trouble could not happen in Taiwan because the government can marshal appropriate defences . 
dealers said the central bank would continue to smooth , if not halt , the currency &apos;s fall amid strong greenback demand . 
it will definitely behave tomorrow , &quot; the dealer said . 
the central bank official said its attitude towards the foreign exchange market remained unchanged . 
Taiwan &apos;s central bank announced on July 31 a modest tightening of monetary policy by raising two key rates in a bid to maintain forex market stability -- though analysts said they suspected the bank also wanted to cool the stock market &apos;s hefty recent turnover . 
the bank has said it would leave the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at the mercy of market forces , but with one caveat . 
&quot; The central bank will respect market forces and let market supply and demand determine the Taiwan dollar exchange rates , &quot; central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong said . 
&quot; But if there are abnormal factors intervening in the market , it will adopt appropriate measures to maintain the foreign exchange market &apos;s stability , &quot; he said .
