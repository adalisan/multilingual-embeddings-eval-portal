palladium prices swung wildly on Thursday as market makers held crisis talks on severe shortages of the metal . 
palladium lurched lower to fix at $ 210.00 per ounce after hitting $ 235.00 in the morning , its highest fixing since the twice-daily fix began in 1989 . 
the spot price was the strongest since early 1980 . 
&quot; It &apos;s a hairy situation ... volatility is huge today , &quot; said analyst Nick Moore of Flemings Global Mining Group . 
platinum , its sister metal , was fixed at $ 442 , up $ 2 from the morning and the highest since July 19 , 1995 . 
the crisis prompted market makers to suspend the market in forward palladium after one-month lease rates shot up to 300 percent on Wednesday night . 
&quot; Now it is purely a spot market , &quot; one dealer said . 
the meeting was an informal get-together to discuss the crisis , but market-makers declined to give any further details . 
dealers said it was unclear what action they might take . 
the talks were held against the backdrop of fears there may be a default in delivery in the physical palladium market . 
but deliveries of the NYMEX June palladium contract , due to expire on June 25 , were proceeding normally , exchange officials said in New York . 
the lack of supplies from Russia was compounded by a 1.5 million ounce palladium stockpile said to be held by the U.S. Tiger Fund . 
compared with gold , platinum and palladium are very small markets and are not blessed with overground stocks running into tens of thousands of tonnes held by central banks . 
&quot; The funds have the ammunition to manipulate it and that is what they are doing in conjunction with Russia &apos;s problems . 
it is a sort of double whammy for the market , &quot; a source said , adding that if similar problems hit the gold market central banks would come in . 
Russia the largest exporter of palladium and the second biggest supplier of platinum after South Africa , has been out of the market this year due to administrative problems in Moscow . 
this week it opened 1997 export talks with importers in Japan , its biggest customer , and exports could begin on June 20 , according to Russian negotiators . 
but the squeeze will take another couple of months to unwind , according to dealers . 
gold tried to stand back from the upheaval in the PGMs , fixing in the afternoon at $ 340.80 , only 10 cents up from the morning level . 
but later the PGM jitters spilled over into the other precious metals and by 1530 GMT spot gold had climbed to an indication of $ 342.30 / $ 342.80 . 
in addtion , gold lease rates had doubled overnight after a wave of borrowing emerged . 
some dealers said this was done on behalf of a New York-based house which had had problems in palladium and was defensively covering forward gold positions . 
silver also reacted , rising to $ 4.81 / $ 4.83 , up six cents from Wednesday &apos;s London close .
