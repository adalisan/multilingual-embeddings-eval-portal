Ukraine &apos;s central bank chief said on Tuesday the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) would take a close look at Ukraine &apos;s new budget in evaluating whether the country should get a long-term , multi-billion dollar credit . 
Viktor Yushchenko told a news conference at a &quot; Window for Ukraine &quot; investment conference in Frankfurt that the purpose of an IMF mission , starting a visit to Kiev on Tuesday , was to evaluate if Ukraine should receive a three-year , $ 2.5- $ 3 billion Extended Fund Facility ( EFF ) . 
&quot; They will conduct an evaluation of the budget and its links to the other conditions which have been set prior to us receiving the EFF , &quot; Yushchenko said . 
the 1997 budget , which parliament passed nearly six months late last Friday , was one of 41 conditions Ukraine had to meet to qualify for the credit to succeed the $ 867 million standby loan which expired in February . 
the IMF said last week they might issue an interim stand-by loan until Ukraine met all the conditions , adding that they hoped the budget would reduce high payroll taxes . 
&quot; If it ( the budget ) would not be sufficient , the alternative in that case would be a short stand-by loan , which we could transfer to a long-term credit this year , &quot; Yushchenko said . 
the IMF-agreed budget calls for a deficit at 5.7 percent of gross domestic product , or four percent by IMF calculations . 
Ukrainian officials said previously they had fulfilled nearly 30 of the 41 conditions .
