Hong Kong &apos;s Hang Seng Index looks set to challenge 14,000 points in the near term after storming to a record high on Wednesday , analysts said . 
a surge by banking and property stocks and receding fears of higher interest rates powered the blue-chip index to its third-biggest point gain ever on Wednesday . 
the Hang Seng jumped 472.78 points , or 3.56 percent , to close at 13,766.65 , beating its previous record close of 13,530.95 on November 27 last year . 
it posted an intra-day record of 13,771.54 points , overshooting the previous record of 13,744.30 on November 28 . 
&quot; Basically , the underlying tone of the market remains very firm , &quot; said Abhijit Chakrabortti , senior strategist at Lehman Brothers . 
&quot; We are literally on the doorstep of 14,000 . 
analysts said the market had been trapped in a range of about 13,000 to 13,500 points since its last record high as investors feared a correction on Wall Street and the possibility of higher interest rates . 
but benign U.S. consumer price data cheered U.S. investors on Tuesday , pushing the Dow industrial average up 53.11 points to 6,762.29 , its fourth straight record close . 
the price of the 30-year U.S. long bond rose one full point to yield 6.77 percent . 
&quot; When you came in this morning and the bond market had had a rally , there was a lot of pent-up interest , &quot; said Richard Verin , head of equity trading at CS First Boston in Hong Kong . 
&quot; You really had two powerful things happening -- the interest rate scenario looks better and the property market is extremely strong . 
there were a lot of warrant issues recently that has led to buying of the underlying shares which has pushed it as well , &quot; he said . 
analysts said the Hong Kong government &apos;s first land auction of the year , held on Wednesday , boosted sentiment in the property sector . 
&quot; The price which it ( the auction ) fetched was reasonably well above what the consensus expected , &quot; said Chakrabortti . 
brokers said funds from overseas had been flowing into Hong Kong on Wednesday . 
the day &apos;s turnover was HK $ 14.17 billion , the fifth-highest ever recorded by the Hong Kong stock exchange . 
&quot; When funds start coming in they won &apos;t suddenly stop , &quot; said Tam . 
&quot; The index will go to 14,000 over the next two weeks because I think the market is on a huge rally . 
shares in HSBC Holdings plc , which analysts said accounted for a good slice of the Hang Seng Index &apos;s rise on Wednesday , were expected to continue pushing higher ahead of the company &apos;s earnings announcement to be released on March 3 . 
&quot; We think that even at this price level HSBC is seriously undervalued , &quot; said Edward Chan , head of research at Amsteel Securities . 
he added the stock could climb to HK $ 196 by the time the company &apos;s earnings are released . 
&quot; I think there is every chance 14,500 ( on the Hang Seng ) will be seen in the first quarter , particularly if you perceive that there is opportunity for the bank ( HSBC ) to trade close to HK $ 200 where a lot of analysts believe it is fair value , &quot; added Miles Remington , sales trader at SocGen-Crosby Securities .
