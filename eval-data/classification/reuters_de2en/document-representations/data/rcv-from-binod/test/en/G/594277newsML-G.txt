Wellington , May 19 - When the Wellington Hurricanes walked from their Athletic Park dressing room last night it was , said hooker Norman Hewitt , the start of a new week . 
Hewitt , outstanding in the 35-29 defeat by the ACT Brumbies , says the Hurricanes &apos; season is not over . 
the team now face one of the really hard tasks of Super 12 rugby -- having to win the semifinal in Canberra to make the final . 
&quot; We still have to be positive . 
it isn &apos;t over . 
we have a semi over there , and I know the players won &apos;t put their heads down and say we &apos;re just happy to be here in this semi position &apos; . 
&quot; We &apos;ll pick ourselves up out of this as long as we all know that we have to learn . 
and we have to learn very quickly on the things we have to improve on . 
Hewitt remarked on the absolute silence in the dressing room yesterday . 
&quot; We are hurting because there are so many things we let ourselves down with -- the expectations of the game , the amount of people that came to watch , and the fact we weren &apos;t able to produce the style of rugby we &apos;ve produced over the last five or six games . 
&quot; So it was really frustrating . 
what we talked about during the week about defence and what we were going to do to turn that into attack we just didn &apos;t do . 
David Knox and George Gregan showed that if you don &apos;t shut them down , they &apos;re going to score points . 
but we can &apos;t dwell on this too long . 
Hewitt never felt the Hurricanes were without a chance of winning , even as time ticked away . 
&quot; Even at that last scrum we asked Colin Hawke how much time we had . 
he said just under a minute and Bull ( captain Mark Allen ) said it didn &apos;t matter because we should score from there . 
but we didn &apos;t , and that was the 
game . 
&quot; We have to start being really positive , because it &apos;s not over . 
we leave on Tuesday and there &apos;s a game to be won . 
we have to say that we can improve a good deal on today . 
all Black coach John Hart agreed with Hewitt that the tables could be turned in Canberra next Saturday . 
they played a bit better . 
but I &apos;ve just told the team that they can be very proud of where they are and that while they &apos;ve lost they are still in the semifinal and that they &apos;ve got a big chance , &quot; Hart said yesterday . 
&quot; I think they have the ability to win away -- they are one of the sides that has got ability to win away . 
we &apos;ve got a really special team here . 
&quot; I think they might even have an advantage in playing away because the other guys will be up in the air now . 
they &apos;ll think they are invincible at home , because they &apos;ve won a lot of games there . 
&quot; These guys ( the Hurricanes ) just have to set for it . 
hart said efforts by Hurricanes players through the season promoted team individuals into trial team contention . 
hart will name his two All Black trial teams tomorrow and Hurricanes players Christian Cullen , Tana Umaga , Mark Cooksley , Norman Hewitt and Mark Allen should all make sides , with Jason O &apos;Halloran being on the fringe . 
hart said injured Alama Ieremia would not be considered for the trial . 
&quot; We want him to work his way back slowly and be careful about it . 
I believe he &apos;s had a special kind of season so far .
