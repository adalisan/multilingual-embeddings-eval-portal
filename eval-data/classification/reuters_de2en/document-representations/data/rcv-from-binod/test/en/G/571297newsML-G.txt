a solid Canadian performance -- and a soft goal -- saw Canada beat Russia 2-1 on Friday and move into the gold medal final at the ice hockey world championship . 
the third period powerplay goal , credited to Travis Green , sealed victory and set up the best-of-three final against Sweden , who advanced with a win over the Czech Republic on Thursday . 
with a face-off deep in the Russian zone , Green , who plays for the NHL New York Islanders , was the last Canadian player to touch the puck before it slipped over to Antoli Fedotov whose attempt to clear it saw the puck go through the goaltender &apos;s legs and nestle in the back of the net . 
&quot; It &apos;s my first goal like that , I guess it came at the right time , &quot; said Green , who only made it into the match after having a one-game suspension for fighting lifted following an appeal on Thursday . 
Canada had to sweat out the final minutes when they were called for too many men on the ice giving Russia a man-advantage . 
Vyacheslav Butsyev had levelled the match 1-1 in the second period after influential Hartford Whaler Keith Primeau had given Canada the early 1-0 lead with his goal in the first . 
it was a gutsy effort by the Canadian side who came into the game short-handed with the San Jose Shark duo of Owen Nolan and Shean Donovan serving one game suspensions for their part in a game-ending brawl against the Czechs . 
&quot; It simply meant the other players had to play harder and that &apos;s what happened , &quot; said coach Andy Murray . 
&quot; Our strength today was that everybody played hard and made a contribution . 
both men will be back in the line-up for the final against Sweden . 
it will be Canada &apos;s second appearance in the gold medal match in as many years . 
last year in Vienna , Canada watched the title slip away when the Czech Republic scored with 19 seconds left in regulation play to record a 4-3 win . 
Canada last won the title in 1994 but before that had gone 33 years without a gold medal . 
Sweden , who beat Canada 7-2 in round-robin play , would like nothing more than to erase the memory of an embarrassing sixth place finish at last year &apos;s championships by claiming their first title since 1992 . 
&quot; We certainly feel challenged to play the Swedes , &quot; said Murray . 
&quot; They beat us very easily earlier in the tournament , it was no contest .
