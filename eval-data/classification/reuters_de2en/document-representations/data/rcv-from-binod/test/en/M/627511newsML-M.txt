Germany &apos;s DAX index of top 30 blue-chip shares ended bourse trade sharply lower , with the market jittery ahead of French elections on Sunday and uncertainty over currency union hit trading sentiment . 
dealers said the clash between Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Germany &apos;s powerful Bundesbank about the valuation of gold reserves fed into market sentiment to drag the DAX index lower . 
the DAX index ended bourse down 88.58 points , or 2.44 percent , at 3,547.84 points , which dealers said was characterised by low volumes . 
many market players extended Thursday &apos;s Corpus Christi regional holiday into a long weekend , which had a severe dampening effect on trading volumes . 
&quot; People are looking to see what &apos;s next in the row between Waigel and the Bundesbank , mainly focusing on its effect on the dollar / mark exchange rate . 
most trade is coming chiefly from the derivatives side , &quot; a Frankfurt trader said . 
overall , the picture for shares was a downbeat one . 
German Bunds were well down early on , while Wall Street closed down 27.05 points at 7,330.18 overnight . 
speculation about a possible victory for the left in Sunday &apos;s elections in France added to the gloomy picture for German equities . 
the spectre of interest rate hikes abroad and at home further clouded the horizon . 
&quot; There is also speculation about possible interest rate rises in Japan , which could feed through into a clear rise in German rates in coming months , &quot; said the trader . 
&quot; Generally we are seeing very quiet volumes today . 
there aren &apos;t that many people around , as a lot are still on holiday . 
we should see a generous level of support between 3,550 and 3,500 points , &quot; he said . 
corporate news was generally thin on the ground . 
shares in Germany &apos;s third largest commercial bank ended bourse down one mark at 50.210 marks , despite issuing upbeat earnings outlooks for 1997 . 
carmaker Volkswagen AG said that its China joint venture had recorded a profit for the first time . 
Volkswagen shares ended down 25.5 marks at 1,104 marks . 
retailer Metro AG was the only gainer among the blue-chips , ending up 95 pfennigs at 186.95 marks .
