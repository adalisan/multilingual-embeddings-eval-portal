Taiwan &apos;s Vice-President LIEN Chan was scheduled to arrive in Dublin late on Thursday , but the Irish government has made it clear he would not receive any official welcome . 
State Television said LIEN , who is visiting the Vatican , would leave Rome at 1240 GMT and was due to arrive in Dublin at 2355 GMT . 
there were no further details about his route . 
&quot; Because communist China has persistently oppressed our international living space , LIEN Chan has kept a very low profile for his second stop in Europe , &quot; the report said . 
it said LIEN may accept an honorary degree from Trinity College or the University of Dublin and meet Irish officials . 
in Dublin , Irish government spokeswoman Ciara Delaney strongly denied Taiwan newspaper reports which quoted her as saying LIEN would visit Ireland and that official contacts could not be ruled out . 
&quot; I emphatically deny ever having said LIEN Chan would visit , &quot; Delaney said . 
&quot; I categorically deny &apos; not ruling out &apos; visits with officials and legislators but emphatically confirm that I ruled out any official meetings because there is no official visit . 
Communist China and Taiwan have been rivals since a civil war in 1949 . 
Beijing , which regards Taiwan as a renegade province ineligible for sovereign recognition , strongly objects to any contacts between Taipei and its diplomatic allies . 
it has tightened a diplomatic squeeze on Taipei in its quest to bring it under mainland rule . 
aside from the Vatican , most of Taiwan &apos;s 30 diplomatic partners are underdeveloped countries in Africa and central America . 
LIEN extended a central American diplomatic mission to Europe earlier this week after attending the inauguration of Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman on January 10 . 
Taiwan &apos;s media has said LIEN visited Nicaragua out of fear that Managua may be tempted to ditch Taipei after South Africa announced in November that it would switch allegiance to China in 1997 .
