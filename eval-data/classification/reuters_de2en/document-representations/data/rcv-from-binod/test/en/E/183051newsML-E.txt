Spain needs to reform its public spending structure in order to meet the terms of the European Union stability pact , a Banco Central Hispano ( BCH ) research note said on Tuesday . 
if public spending cuts in the 1997 budget are not extended to social spending and public transfers in the subsequent three years , Spain runs the risk of the public deficit overshooting the one percent of GDP target by the year 2000 , the note said . 
&quot; Fiscal policy of this kind will generate an additional need for a 1.7 trillion peseta adjustment , making a structural reform of public spending inevitable , &quot; BCH said . 
although there were good prospects for EU convergence in terms of the public deficit , inflation and interest rates , BCH warned of a possible delay in the recovery in economic activity which could affect the fiscal side and the spread on long-term interest rates . 
&quot; The poor performance of registered unemployment in September and October suggest a slower-than-expected recovery in economic activity , &quot; BCH said . 
Spain &apos;s registered jobless rate was 14.1 percent in October compared to 13.5 percent in August . 
BCH said the Bank of Spain may cut its key money rate by 50 basis points from 6.75 percent in the second quarter of 1997 , provided that &quot; progress in inflation convergence and the strict implementation of the budget is confirmed &quot; .
