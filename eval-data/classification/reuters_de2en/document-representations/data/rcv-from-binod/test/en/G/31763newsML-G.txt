soldiers and police evacuated a department store on Wednesday in a shopping mall in the popular tourist resort of Acapulco after an anonymous caller warned of a bomb , radio reports said . 
the reports said soldiers from a bomb disposal squad were seen leaving the store with a package inside a box but an official spokesman refused to say whether a bomb was actually found . 
Acapulco is 180 miles ( 300 km ) from Mexico City on the Pacific Coast in the state of Guerrero , a poor and backward region where a new Marxist guerrilla army , the EPR , sprang up at the end of June . 
Guerrero officials have been reluctant to disseminate information about security issues to foreign media in the wake of the EPR &apos;s appearance and it was not possible to glean official comment in the state on Wednesday &apos;s bomb threat .
