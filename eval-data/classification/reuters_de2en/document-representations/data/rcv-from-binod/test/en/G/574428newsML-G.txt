Taiwan &apos;s Foreign Ministry said on Sunday it was very unhappy with South Korea &apos;s decision to downgrade the status of Taiwanese officials at the Second East Asian Games . 
&quot; The Republic of China government is extremely dissatisfied with the South Korean government &apos;s unfriendly move , &quot; the Foreign Ministry said in a statement . 
&quot; The ministry has ordered its representative office in South Korea to lodge a strong protest to the South Korean government as soon as possible , &quot; the statement said . 
it said South Korea , which is hosting the games that began in Pusan on Saturday , revoked the &quot; distinguished guests &quot; status given to three Taiwan Education Ministry officials , including Minister Wu Jin , and downgraded their status . 
Taiwan media blamed Seoul &apos;s decision on pressure by Taipei &apos;s political rival , Beijing , for the loss of privileges for the Taiwanese officials . 
South Korea stunned Taiwan &apos;s exiled Republic of China government by switching diplomatic ties to China in 1992 . 
China has viewed the island as a renegade province not entitled to international relations since a civil war separated them in 1949 . 
&quot; At the time when relations ( between Taiwan and South Korea ) are at their low ebb , the Republic of China government hopes the South Korean side can take immediate action to rectify its unfriendly move so that normal development of our future relations will not be affected , &quot; the statement said . 
a controversial agreement between Taipei and Pyongyang to ship up to 200,000 barrels of nuclear waste to North Korea has triggered protests in South Korea , which has expressed concerns about nuclear contamination on the Korean peninsula . 
Taipei has reiterated its determination to press ahead with the waste shipments , despite growing pressure from South Korea and China .
