the choice of Inder Kumar Gujral as India &apos;s next prime minister keeps peace talks with Pakistan on track , but question marks surround his economic policy and the life span of his disparate coalition . 
analysts said on Sunday the selection of the two-time external affairs minister as the successor to caretaker Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda virtually ensured the continuity of his foreign policy , dubbed the &quot; Gujral Doctrine &quot; . 
&quot; As foreign minister , I have built some sort of a doctrine regarding neighbourly relations , &quot; Gujral told Reuters Television on Sunday . 
&quot; That will continue to be my priority area . 
the hallmarks of his policy , sketched out during the 10-month reign of DEVE Gowda &apos;s government , were landmark water treaties with Bangladesh and Nepal , and the resumption of peace talks with Pakistan after a three-year period of acrimony . 
the political crisis that erupted on March 30 when the Congress party revoked its make-or-break support for DEVE Gowda &apos;s United Front coalition cast a shadow over high-level talks with Pakistan that were under way in New Delhi . 
now , talks between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan set to take place during a regional summit next month assume added importance as Gujral , who has spearheaded the drive to ease tensions with Islamabad , will represent Delhi . 
in Islamabad , Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s press adviser Mushahid Hussain said Pakistan would welcome Gujral as prime minister , recalling a &quot; cordial and pleasant &quot; meeting between Gujral and Sharif , then in opposition , in 1995 . 
Hussain said Gujral &quot; comes across as a person with a positive perspective on relations with Pakistan and we only hope that in his new position he will be able to translate that perspective into a practical policy &quot; . 
&quot; Gujral &apos;s rise to Give fillip to Indo-Pak Talks , &quot; said a headline in India &apos;s Pioneer newspaper , which called the prime minister-in-waiting &quot; a politician , a statesman and a gentleman &quot; with a healing touch . 
the choice of Gujral brought a welcome end to India &apos;s three-week political crisis , but left many questions unanswered . 
&quot; Behind that collective sigh of relief lie vital and uneasy questions , &quot; wrote Indian Express editor Shekhar Gupta , noting the stormy departure of Finance Minister P. Chidambaram &apos;s regional Tamil Maanila Congress ( TMC ) from the government . 
the TMC backed out after left-wing parties in the United Front blocked its candidate for prime minister , G.K. Moopanar . 
&quot; Chidambaram &apos;s departure will send the wrong kind of signal to the rest of the world , &quot; Gautam Adhikari , former editor of the Times of India , told Reuters . 
&quot; He had presented a face of India which is modern , progressive and open . 
Chidambaram &apos;s investor-friendly budget , held hostage to the political turmoil , was to be taken up by parliament on Monday . 
while few doubted its ultimate passage , there were questions about Gujral &apos;s commitment to free-market economics . 
&quot; The antecedents are not very promising , &quot; said independent political analyst Rasheed Talib . 
&quot; Will he be obliged to the left-wing parties which allowed him to win out against Moopanar ? 
is he willing to kick the ladder which he climbed to reach office ? 
Adhikari said : &quot; We don &apos;t know what his views are . 
I hope he will be strong enough to resist the influence of those who want to take the economy back to the pre-1991 days of big spending . 
Gujral , 77 , formed his world views during the Cold War , when he once served as ambassador in Moscow . 
&quot; His old world values are positive in many ways , but I don &apos;t know if he has changed sufficiently to look at the world differently , &quot; Adhikari said . 
said a Western diplomat : &quot; He hasn &apos;t exactly been a friend of the United States . 
the United Front &apos;s competing ideologies and personalities which reared their heads during the three-week crisis , and the alliance &apos;s uneasy relations with Congress spell trouble for Gujral in the months ahead , the analysts agreed . 
&quot; I would expect a general election between October and December , &quot; Talib said .
