Dutch shares climbed to a sharply higher close on Friday , the AEX index of leading stocks almost recouping the hefty 14-point fall sustained on Thursday . 
but dealers pointed out that turnover remained thin , accentuating any moves and continental institutional investors in particular were still absent from the market . 
the AEX index finished the day 11.54 points higher at 645.95 , the high for the day . 
&quot; There are pockets of buying around but it &apos;s very scattered . 
everybody is waiting for the institutions to come back in before seriously committing themselves , &quot; one dealer said . 
but a higher start on Wall Street on Friday , following on from Thursday &apos;s recovery , and a firm undertone to the domestic bond market was enough to give the Dutch market renewed cheer . 
insurer Aegon had another good day as its $ 3.5 billion buy of U.S. Providian &apos;s insurance activities continued to be well received . 
the stock put on another 3.70 guilders to 112.50 . 
analysts at Suez Nederland re-iterated a buy recommendation on Aegon , forecasting growth and cost savings from synergy . 
predicting a 15 percent EPS growth in the coming years , Suez said : &quot; Aegon continues to outperform the other Dutch financials and appears to be the less interest rate sensitive . 
publisher Wegener was another star performer , putting on 12.60 guilders or 7.83 percent to 173.50 guilders after the company announced a positive profit forecast for next year and the sale of its stake in Dutch commercial television station TV10 , long regarded as a mill-stone by analysts . 
it announced the sale of the stake to Saban entertainment Inc on Thursday . 
early on Friday it forecast further 1997 profit and EPS growth based on organic growth and acquisitions . 
chemical group Akzo Nobel rose quickly in the afternoon , ending 8.70 guilders higher at 241.00 but dealers said there was little fresh news behind the move . 
one said the stock was picking up good buying from U.S. investors , who regarded the pharmaceuticals sector as undervalued .
