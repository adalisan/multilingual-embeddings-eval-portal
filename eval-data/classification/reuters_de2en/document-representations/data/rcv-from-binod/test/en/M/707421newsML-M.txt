Argentine stocks were seen flat in muted trading Friday during the U.S. 
independence Day holiday , dealers said . 
&quot; It &apos;s a day we could &apos;ve skipped , &quot; said Adolfo Adorno at Agra traders . 
&quot; Many people won &apos;t even turn up and prices will probably tick sideways . 
the blue-chip MerVal index rose 0.9 percent Thursday to set a new five-year high of 831.44 on the back of a rally on Wall Street . 
but traders said the Bolsa was running out of steam and players would remain cautious . 
&quot; We had very good news with the U.S. jobs report Thursday but even if the Dow charges higher , the MerVal will need some more time to consolidate , &quot; another dealer said . 
he said stocks in the steel and construction sectors remained good buys , while bank , telephone and oil stocks might face a mild correction . 
analysts said long-term prospects remained good based on strong economic growth and corporate mergers involving foreign firms , especially in the banking sector . 
&quot; But I would advise clients to hold their positions for now , &quot; Adorno said .
