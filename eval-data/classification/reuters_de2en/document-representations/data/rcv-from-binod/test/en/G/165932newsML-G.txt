a group of African leaders began a one-day summit on the conflict in eastern Zaire on Tuesday but Zaire &apos;s empty seat undermined hopes for real progress . 
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi called the summit at short notice as pressure built up on Africa to defuse a crisis threatening the lives of one million Hutu refugees in Zaire . 
&quot; Today the attention of the world is focused on Nairobi , &quot; Moi said in remarks before the summit went into closed session . 
&quot; The conflict in eastern Zaire poses a serious threat to the stability of the entire region , &quot; he said . 
the presidents of Eritrea , Rwanda , Tanzania , Uganda , and Zambia and the prime minister of Ethiopia attended the talks on Africa &apos;s most serious crisis since the 1994 genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda in the same &quot; Great Lakes &quot; region . 
the secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) , the foreign minister of current OAU chairman Cameroon and elder statesman Julius Nyerere also took part . 
but Zaire &apos;s place was vacant . 
&quot; If somebody comes from Kinshasa , the seat is waiting , &quot; a Kenyan official said . 
Zaire &apos;s shaky government made clear it would attend no forum of this kind until Rwandan troops withdrew from its territory . 
Kinshasa claims the rulers of Rwanda , Burundi and Uganda are behind the Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsi rebels who have captured large parts of eastern Zaire . 
it says they all have a hidden agenda to carve out a &quot; Tutsiland &quot; in the Great Lakes area . 
&quot; Ethnic differences have become the source of many conflicts in Africa , &quot; Moi said . 
he warned of the risk of a great calamity and appealed to the international community to continue providing humanitarian assistance to the victims of the conflict . 
numerically , the largest afflicted group are more than one million Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi who are now fending for themselves after foreign aid workers evacuated the war zone in eastern Zaire . 
France is leading the outside pressure for a military-backed intervention force to help the refugees . 
but the Hutus , who helped commit the genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 , are refusing to go home . 
Zaire wants them to go and Rwanda says it is ready to receive them . 
but Rwanda and its overwhelmingly Tutsi army is certain to oppose any intervention which might loosen the rebels &apos; grip on the east of Zaire . 
Hutu fighters among the refugees launched incursions into Rwanda and Burundi from their camps before the lightning offensive by the ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels . 
France is viewed with hostility and suspicion by Rwanda &apos;s new rulers , largely because it was a close ally of the former Hutu regime which ordered the genocide . 
&quot; If there were a decision for such an intervention ... it would be opposed by the sub-region by all means , not only political , &quot; Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana told a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday .
