the recent strength of the dollar should not have a major repercussion on Italian inflation , with companies capable of absorbing the currency fluctuations , a senior official at statistics office Istat said . 
&quot; From an accounting point of view , ( the strong dollar ) will not have a huge effect , &quot; said Enrico Giovannini , head of Istat &apos;s economic department . 
&quot; It &apos;s clear that costs will go up , but Italian companies have shown they are capable of working over the medium-term and therefore of drawing up price plans , absorbing oscillating costs , &quot; he told reporters . 
earlier Istat reported that inflation rose 1.6 percent year-on-year in July against 1.4 percent in June . 
the government is concerned that recent strong gains by the dollar , which has hit its highest level against the lira since 1989 , will have a negative impact on inflation .
