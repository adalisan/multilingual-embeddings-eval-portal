Ricardo is doing fine in his new career as a coach after finding it harder than marriage to take the plunge . 
&quot; I think it was a more difficult decision than to get married or not get married , &quot; said the 31-year-old Brazilian manager of Paris St Germain whose full name is Ricardo Gomes . 
I wasn &apos;t very satisfied with my performances , &quot; he said in an interview . 
he was also troubled by a nagging leg muscle problem that forced him to withdraw from the Brazil side which he captained , just before the 1994 World Cup which the Brazilians won . 
Ricardo has steered Paris St Germain to a top spot in the French first division at the halfway point in the season . 
six months ago , he was still a Benfica centre-back looking at possibly two more years as a player and uncertain of his future beyond that . 
&quot; I was thinking perhaps of returning to Brazil to play out my career there , &quot; he said after holding a PSG training session in snowy conditions prior to a league match in the Normandy city of Caen . 
&quot; When you &apos;ve spent a long time away you get bouts of nostalgia , &quot; said Ricardo , who began his career with Rio de Janeiro side Fluminense . 
in their two seasons under Luis Fernandez , PSG failed to regain the league championship which they won in 1994 with Ricardo at the heart of their defence . 
Fernandez led them to the European Cup Winners &apos; Cup in May but departed for Athletic Bilbao while PSG executive director Michel Denisot went in search of a replacement . 
he sought and got Ricardo who , though totally lacking in experience as a coach , was regarded as an insider by the club where he had left a good impression in four years as a player . 
Ricardo is nominally manager , having no trainer &apos;s title , while former France goalkeeper Joel BATs , his assistant , figures as coach on the team sheet . 
under the pair , PSG went the first nine league games without conceding a goal , taking the lead after five matches and ultimately going 13 unbeaten . 
they have lost twice since . 
&quot; I didn &apos;t know how to work as a coach and had to get to know the players , so it &apos;s not bad for only six months , &quot; said Ricardo , who had not even considered coaching prior to the PSG offer . 
&quot; But then it &apos;s much easier in a club like Paris St Germain . 
in signing his compatriot and former national team mate Leonardo from new Japanese champions Kashima Antlers , Ricardo extended the club &apos;s love affair with Brazilian players . 
&quot; It began when ( private television company ) Canal Plus took over ( the club in 1991 ) , &quot; he said . 
money was made available to coach Artur Jorge to strengthen his squad and , being Portuguese , he delved into the market he knew in his home country where numerous Brazilians play , Ricardo explained . 
Ricardo was signed in 1991 along with Valdo and Geraldo , who only stayed one season . 
RAI followed from Sao Paulo after the championship season and stayed on after Ricardo and Valdo both returned to Benfica in mid-1995 . 
the money also enabled PSG to sign David Ginola , now with Newcastle United , and current world footballer of the year George Weah , who has since moved to AC Milan .
