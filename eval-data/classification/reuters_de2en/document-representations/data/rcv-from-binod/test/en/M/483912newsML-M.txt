physical copper premiums in Britain have edged higher as a shortage of metal has persisted , forcing some customers to pay high fees to import from the continent , traders said . 
premiums for prompt metal have risen to $ 40 / $ 50 per tonne over London Metal Exchange cash , up from $ 35 / $ 45 last week and $ 30 / $ 35 in early March . 
&quot; If you want it today , you won &apos;t get it , &quot; said one trader . 
the last 25 tonnes was reported being delivered out on March 24 , compared to 4,800 tonnes which was being stored in early February . 
&quot; I understand some people had to bring in some metal from Rotterdam or Hamburg , which cost about $ 50 / $ 55 ( over LME cash ) including all of the fees . 
but they had to do it since they had a commitment , &quot; a trader said . 
overall , though , physical copper business was sluggish , traders said . 
premiums in Rotterdam were little changed for Chilean copper at $ 30 / $ 35 and Good Western at $ 20 / $ 30 . 
&quot; There &apos;s not much of it around , but then there &apos;s not much demand either , &quot; a trader said . 
demand was said to be rather weak in Italy , where premiums were around $ 25 / $ 35 . 
a British scrap merchant quoted copper bright wire scrap at $ 1,400 / 50 stg per tonne , down about 20 stg from last week as LME futures prices eased .
