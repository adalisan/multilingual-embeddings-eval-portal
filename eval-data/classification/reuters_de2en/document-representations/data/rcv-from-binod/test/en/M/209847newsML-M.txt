the Indonesian rupiah fell against the dollar in moderate late trading on Friday on high liquidity , dealers said . 
they said overnight rupiah fell to some 7.75 percent and overnight swap to 0.80 / 0.85 points on the back of flush supply . 
&quot; The rupiah is so cheap now . 
it &apos;s more profitable to hold long dollars , &quot; one major local bank dealer said . 
&quot; In fact , we have been going long on dollars in the past few days . 
we just cash out at present &quot; . 
spot rupiah fell to a low of 2,345.0 before recovering to 2,343.75 / 44.25 at 0900 GMT . 
it opened at 2,340.0 / 41.0 . 
the dealer said going long on dollars was more profitable because daily roll-over costs were about 0.3 cents , or a weekly cost of some 2.1 cents . 
&quot; On the other hand , we all know that the central bank has been depreciating the rupiah by at least three points a week or sometimes four points , &quot; the dealer said . 
he said this offered a gain of some one to two points if investors went long on dollars . 
&quot; This calculation is based on the assumption that we don &apos;t have any bad news which could push down the dollar , &quot; one said . 
&quot; The potential of making profits by holding dollars is better now . 
we also do not expect any band widening in the short-term , &quot; the local bank dealer said . 
&quot; I think many local banks have gone long on dollars because they are enjoying cheap funds , &quot; another said . 
one economist said the present central bank depreciation policy suggested that it did not want to widen its band . 
&quot; If the central bank wants to widen the band , it wouldn &apos;t have to weaken the rupiah by three or four points a week , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The central bank had lowered the rupiah each time the market wanted to challenge the bank . 
this may mean that the bank is ready to take up any market speculation , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think this is the signal Bank Indonesia wants to send . 
the economist said the recent faster depreciation did not mean that this pace would be maintained in the long-run . 
&quot; It &apos;s temporary because there is room in the short-term . 
the central bank also has to watch out for possible imported inflation if the rupiah is depreciated too fast , &quot; he said . 
overnight money closed at 7.75 / 8.00 percent . 
the central bank offered overnight papers ( SBIs ) at 7.5 percent . 
one foreign bank dealer said another reason for the recovery in the dollar was the refunds to applicants of Bank Negara Indonesia &apos;s ( BNI ) public offer who were not successful . 
&quot; Many foreign operators seemed to have converted rupiah to dollars with the funds from BNI , &quot; the dealer said . 
one U.S. bank dealer said some offshore operators were also seen buying dollars in anticipation of narrowing interest rate differentials between the dollar and the rupiah after the central bank seemed to loosen its monetary policy recently . 
one-week central bank papers ( SBIs ) fell to 11.0 percent on Friday from 11.5 percent on Thursday .
