the Taiwan dollar closed slightly lower against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday , reflecting mild foreign fund outflow . 
dealers nonetheless expected a stable trend ahead . 
&quot; Some investors decided to take profits on the local currency &apos;s recent rebound , but otherwise trading was pretty even , &quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank . 
he expected the rate to maintain a steady level in the near term . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see dramatic factors swinging the rate either way , &quot; he said .
