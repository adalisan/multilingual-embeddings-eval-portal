President Boris Yeltsin sought on Wednesday to defuse the political crisis in Belarus and persuade hardline President Alexander Lukashenko to attend a peace summit with his opposition on Russian soil . 
Lukashenko &apos;s top aide Vladimir Zametalin told Reuters the president spoke by telephone to Yeltsin , who is still in Moscow &apos;s Central Clinical Hospital recovering from heart surgery two weeks ago . 
there was no word on whether Lukashenko , who is seeking to increase his powers in a referendum this Sunday , would agree to a compromise in the face of Russian pressure . 
&quot; The president is very busy . 
he has a very tight schedule . 
I do not know if he will find a window in his schedule to go to Smolensk , &quot; Mikhail Podgainy , head of Lukashenko &apos;s information department , said by telephone . 
Belarussian parliament chairman Semyon Sharetsky , spokesman for the president &apos;s opposition , said he was ready to attend a projected peace summit starting at 1400 GMT in Smolensk , a western Russian city halfway between Moscow and Minsk . 
the meeting would also be attended by Gennady Seleznyov , chairman of the Russian Duma , and Yegor Stroyev , chairman of the Federation Council upper house , as well as Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . 
Sharetsky said parliament wanted Lukashenko to cancel the referendum , withdraw his proposed changes to the constitution and a series of decrees , reinstate the sacked head of the Central Electoral Commission and give deputies TV time . 
&quot; Belarus was once a peaceful , hard-working republic . 
now it has been transformed into a battlefield , an arena of hatred . 
society is divided , parliament is divided , and the president has set himself against the people and divided society , &quot; he said . 
Sharetsky &apos;s press spokesman told Reuters that Yeltsin , who also spoke to him by phone , had backed this &quot; zero option &quot; solution , but this could not be confirmed . 
Deputy speaker Vasily Novikov made clear after Sharetsky &apos;s 10-minute conversation with Yeltsin that deputies would drop threats to impeach Lukashenko if he cancelled the referendum . 
but Lukashenko &apos;s campaign for the referendum , in which early voting began on November 9 , continued apace as the two sides spoke . 
loudspeaker vehicles were heard in central Minsk , blasting out appeals to the population to vote and support Lukashenko . 
Lukashenko has so far been defiant , telling his critics at a rally on Monday that he would not give up power and they should prepare to &quot; find another motherland &quot; after the referendum . 
but he faces increasing criticism abroad as well as the threat of impeachment . 
in the first sign tension might be easing after weeks of mounting confrontation , a senior political source in the former Soviet republic said on Tuesday Lukashenko had expressed a readiness to compromise . 
Lukashenko , who controls the security forces and most of the media and who enjoys considerable support among the mostly rural population of 10 million , has vowed to override any opposition . 
a Kremlin spokesman said earlier on Tuesday President Boris Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin &quot; expressed alarm about rising tension &quot; and hoped that common sense and compromise would prevail . 
Lukashenko has ignored the current constitution and rulings by the Constitutional Court in declaring that the referendum must be binding . 
the 42-year-old leader has scorned Western criticism but is heavily dependent on the political winds blowing from Moscow and needs Russian economic support . 
he and Yeltsin agreed in April to unite in a &quot; community &quot; . 
Lukashenko is seeking authority to extend his term by more than two years and widen his powers over all institutions .
