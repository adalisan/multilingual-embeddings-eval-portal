French bond and interest rate futures closed lower on Tuesday , weighed on by renewed debate about social unrest during the coming budget season and worries about France &apos;s qualification for a single European currency . 
the notionnel settled at 123.12 , two ticks higher than the closing price . 
the franc also showed evidence of investor doubt about France &apos;s ability to cut its budget deficit enough to qualify to European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) . 
the French unit fell as low as 3.4235 before recovering to about 3.4211 at 1450 GMT . 
dealers said the notionnel could probably limit its losses as long as it did not fall below 123.00 , which they said looked like a good place to buy the contract . 
below that , the next support level was at 122.80 , they said . 
the markets were likely to remain relatively calm this week , the last before the end of the summer holiday season in France . 
once September arrives activity , and volatility , could well pick up , dealers said . 
many analysts expect French markets to sell off during the budget season unless they are satisfied the government is putting forward a credible budget . 
the government has said it will freeze 1997 spending at 1996 levels , cut taxes and meet all criteria for the Maastricht treaty on EMU , a task private economists say will be difficult . 
in the autumn of 1995 worries about France and EMU weakened the franc and forced the Bank of France to raise short term interest rates to fend off attacks on the currency . 
most analysts think market reaction is likely to be less violent this year but do not rule anything out .
