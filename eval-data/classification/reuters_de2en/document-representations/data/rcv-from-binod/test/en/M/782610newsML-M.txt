Southeast Asia &apos;s rubber markets are expected to be fragile in the near term following news of high Thai stock levels but could bounce back on improved demand after the summer holiday season , traders said on Wednesday . 
they also said that Thailand , the world &apos;s top rubber producer , would seek to boost its market share in Europe and the United States as the country &apos;s plan to increase output of rubber used in industrialised countries gathers speed . 
the regional markets had been downcast since Monday after a Thai industry official told a regional gathering of producers on the tourist island of Bali over the weekend that the country had excess stocks of around 140,000 tonnes . 
traders who attended the meeting said the official had said about half the amount was in the hands of the private sector . 
&quot; We are already feeling the impact of the statement , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; buyers have withdrawn from the market , and I expect prices to weaken through the week . 
&quot; But I am cautiously optimistic that prices will gain some strength when the summer holiday season is over and buyers begin to head back into the market , &quot; he added . 
traders said Indonesian rubber prices edged down on Wednesday on thin buying interest , while Singapore rubber futures were untraded in the morning session . 
Indonesian traders said they were puzzled over the Thai stock disclosure at a gathering where buyers were also present . 
&quot; Is there a hidden agenda for such market sensitive information to be made public , especially when buyers were present , &quot; one trader wondered . 
&quot; The news has hit us . 
&quot; It is certainly a factor in the market , and buyers are taking advantage of the situation , &quot; he added . 
traders said the announement could be linked to Thailand &apos;s increased production of technically-specified rubber used by tyre-makers in Europe and the United States and the winding down of sheet rubber output shipped mostly to Japan and China . 
&quot; Thai rubber prices have to be attractive in order for them to be able to sell to Europe and the United States , which are traditional markets of Indonesia and Malaysia , &quot; one said . 
&quot; I think the process of switching from sheet rubber to technically specified rubber in Thailand is much faster than can be taken up by the U.S. and European markets , &quot; he added . 
he said Thailand &apos;s buyers in China and Japan were not ready to absorb all of Bangkok &apos;s technically specified rubber , and so Thai players have to look to the United States and Europe . 
&quot; But I think it is only a matter of time before China &apos;s demand for technically specified rubber increases because as we know there are many multinationals which are setting up joint venture factories there , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Thailand is a newcomer to the technically specified rubber market and therefore its prices have to be competitive against rubber from Indonesia and Malaysia , &quot; he added . 
traders said producing technically specified rubber was a difficult process that needed years to perfect because it had to be made in accordance with tyre-makers &apos; specifications which varied from one company to another .
