although the rise of Estonian shares during July and August has been meteoric , prices may not yet have peaked and a stockmarket crash is seen as unlikely , dealers and analysts said on Friday . 
at worst , a short-term correction may take place , they said . 
since the start of July the Talse Index has soared by around 50 percent . 
since the start of the year , the Estonian bourse has jumped a massive 158 percent or 253.2 points to 413.20 at the close of trade Thursday . 
over the past five weeks , usually a slow period , leading bank Hansapank , which accounts for 40 percent of the market , has risen 84.9 kroons or 63 percent to 219.90 kroons while second-largest bank Hoiupank jumped 110 kroons or 75 percent to 256 . 
&quot; The fundamentals from the companies &apos; first-half results are very good and all the news out of Estonia is good , &quot; said Katri Kumpulainen , London-based analyst with Societe Generale . 
Kumpulainen said the Talse bourse was a &quot; liquidity-driven market &quot; and thus subject to sharp price swings -- a view shared by James Oates , analyst at UBS in London . 
&quot; It is a small bourse so a small amount of money can move it a long way , &quot; said Oates . 
there were rumours foreign investors were fuelling the boom in prices , but both local dealers and foreign analysts see the gains as locally driven . 
&quot; We are seeing foreign investors as the net sellers at present and it looks to be mostly local investment that is keeping the bourse up , &quot; a local senior trader said . 
the most recent rise came on news the EU Commission recommended Estonia to start talks to join the European Union along with Poland , the Czech Republic , Hungary and Slovenia . 
&quot; News that Estonia would be included in the first wave of EU expansion did have an effect and the local market viewed it very positively , &quot; said Nomura analyst Martin Gollner . 
&quot; It is good news for the medium term but local brokers seem to be bidding up the market on that news , &quot; he added . 
Estonia has a strong local investor base with institutional and private investors placing more funds in equities . 
but despite the sharp gains , investors appetite for Estonian shares does not appear to be dying out just yet and a correction , although likely , may not come for several more weeks . 
&quot; Prices are seen to be high but while the fundamentals of the companies remain good there is no expectation of a big downward correction , &quot; a senior dealer said . 
in terms of price / earnings , Estonia at 15.2 is approaching Hungary at 15 . 
Poland is rated at 11.6 while the Czech republic is at 10.8 , analysts said . 
but givens Hansapank &apos;s huge weighting in the Talse Index , comparisons with other bourses are difficult , Kumpulainen said . 
with the approach of large privatisations in Latvia and Lithuania , interest is expected to focus on the neighbouring bourses , allowing Estonia to cool . 
&quot; I expect some interest in the markets of the other two Baltic countries especially with the privatisation of large companies under way , &quot; Nomura &apos;s Gollner said .
