South Carolina &apos;s Charleston County Council deferred a decision on whether to issue $ 85 million of revenue bonds to renovate a hospital building for a physicians group affiliated with Medical University , Post and Courrier reported Thursday . 
the council voted 8-1 Wednesday to send the matter back to the same committee that recommended against issuing the bonds last week . 
&quot; I think it was a responsible action , &quot; Medical University President James Edwards told the newspaper . 
medical University and its nonprofit phsyicians practice group , University Medical Associates , sought conduit financing to renovate the 12-story building formerly used by Bon Secours-St . Francis Xavier Hospital . 
the county council &apos;s finance committee recommended against the financing because the university has proposed leasing its hospitals to Columbia / HCA Healthcare Corp , a for-profit company . 
supporters of the proposal noted that the county has provided similar conduit financing for other hospitals . 
Edwards said financing the project with tax-exempt bonds would save money and keep down the cost of providing health care to indigent patients . 
the council asked the finance committee to reevaluate the deal after further review by attorneys , staff and the public .
