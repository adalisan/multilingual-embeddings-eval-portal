a Danish court setting boundaries for a legal challenge to the nation &apos;s European Union membership left lawyers and politicians in suspense on Friday , promising to deliver judgement after the weekend . 
&quot; The court will reconvene to give its decision next week , you will be informed as to the date and time , &quot; Judge Bent Otken told litigants . 
eleven Danish citizens are suing their government , charging that gradual assignment of national sovereignty to EU central institutions over the years contravenes the constitution . 
Friday &apos;s district court session was to determine the parameters of the main case , expected to begin next year . 
the non-partisan group of 11 seeks to prove its case by examining the EU &apos;s founding Treaty of Rome and bringing as evidence transcripts of parliamentary and cabinet meetings and copies of instructions to Denmark &apos;s representatives in Brussels . 
the government , which wants debate confined to events subsequent to the 1992 Maastricht acccord , said that assembling and examining such a mountain of documents would delay proceedings until the year 2010 and was in any case unjustified . 
&quot; The appellants are simply trying to go on a fishing expedition , &quot; government lawyer Karsten Hagel-Soerensen told the court on Friday . 
ultimately at stake in the case , expected to last at least two years , is whether Denmark can carry on as a member of the EU under existing terms , or must choose between renegotiating membership and attempting to amend the constitution . 
lawyers say that whoever wins the opening procedural stage will have an advantage when the substantive case comes to court next year . 
they rejected Maastricht altogether in a 1992 referendum and approved it the following year only on condition that Denmark stay out of European Monetary Union and joint defence , policing and citizenship arrangements . 
but close observers of the constitutional battle say that is not an expression of Euro-scepticsm but an attempt in good faith to address vital legal issues . 
&quot; If there has been any case in our history that merits full attention it is this one , &quot; Hjalte Rasmussen , professor of European law at Copenhagen University , told Reuters . 
&quot; The political class finds it very unpleasant , I find it enormously unpleasant , but at the same time I think that if we want to live under the rule of law , if we want to combine democracy with constitutionalism , we have to accept that the constitution is there , &quot; he said .
