Milan , Sept 25 - Italy is now expected to overshoot a 1996 budget deficit target of 113 trillion lire by 10 to 11 trillion lire , treasury minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said in an interview with Rome daily La Repubblica on Wednesday . 
Ciampi said newspaper reports that the government was preparing to table a 40 trillion lire 1997 budget package were exaggerated . 
he gave no figure but La Repubblica reported that he was aiming for a 37 trillion lire package . 
&quot; We now find ourselves faced with a 1996 deficit which is 10 to 11 trillion higher than forecast , &quot; said Ciampi . 
the government &apos;s three-year economic programme , approved by parliament in July , had called for a 32.4 trillion lire budget for next year . 
Ciampi said a further fiscal tightening would be needed in 1997 to keep alive Italy &apos;s chances of qualifying for European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) , whose launch is planned for 1999 . 
asked if an additional 18-20 trillion lire package was planned in the course of 1997 , Ciampi said : &quot; I still don &apos;t know . 
but in order to enter Europe ( EMU ) this is an essential step . 
the 1997 budget alone would lower the budget deficit to 4.5 percent from around 6.5 percent now forecast for this year , Ciampi said . 
that is still well short of the three percent deficit-to-GDP target set in the Maastricht treaty . 
&quot; But we are also on the right track . 
another effort is needed , of little more than one ( percentage ) point of GDP . 
that is , the package which is already outlined in the DPEF ( three-year economic strategy ) , &quot; Ciampi said . 
Ciampi said the government had to set in motion a virtuous circle which would trigger a steady decline in interest rates and a fall in the heavy burden of financing the debt . 
interest payments alone on outstanding debt amounted to around 10 percent of GDP . 
&quot; Can we live with this fearful burden ? 
no , we must bring it down . 
and the key way to achieve it is that of adopting virtuous behaviour able to feed the confidence of investors and to make interest rates fall , &quot; Ciampi told the newspaper . 
asked if a severe fiscal tightening would have an impact on an already faltering economy , Ciampi replied that the European economy was starting to recover , led by Germany . 
&quot; All the more reason for us to take advantage of it , doing everything in order not to miss a train which is within reach of the country &apos;s potential , &quot; he added .
