Cesare Romiti , chairman of industrial giant Fiat , said he saw no signs yet of an Italian upturn and that a fall in inflation was mainly due to the economy &apos;s weakness . 
&quot; The country still has a desperate need of growth and the economy does not seem to show signs of awakening , &quot; he said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa . 
&quot; The record fall in prices is certainly due to the anti-inflationist policy of the government and the rigour of the Bank of Italy , but it cannot be denied that it is also linked to the weakness of the economy , &quot; Romiti said . 
Italian CPI inflation has been slashed to an estimated 1.5 percent year-on-year in May from 4.3 percent a year ago . 
Romiti said the only sector where a recovery was noticeable was the auto sector , which has benefited from a government sponsored bonus incentive scheme to swap old cars for new . 
Fiat Auto , which dominates the domestic car market , has seen sales jump since the scheme was introduced in January . 
&quot; These forms of support should be judged by their results and indeed could be extended to other sectors , like household electrical appliances , motorbikes or the building industry , &quot; Romiti added .
