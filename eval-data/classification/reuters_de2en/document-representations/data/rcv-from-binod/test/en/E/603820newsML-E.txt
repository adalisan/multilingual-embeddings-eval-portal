the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) sees a good chance for Russian economic reforms to come back on track and is happy with its agreement to resume loans to that country , deputy managing director Stanley Fischer said . 
&quot; I think that the Russian reform programme , which was doing so well until early 1996 , now has a very good chance of coming back on track , &quot; Fischer told Reuters Financial Television in an interview broadcast on Wednesday . 
&quot; And certainly the IMF is very happy with the agreements we &apos;ve reached with the new team , &quot; he added . 
Fischer said that Russia &apos;s biggest problem is that the government is not collecting enough revenue . 
&quot; They &apos;ve got to get the fiscal situation under control , &quot; he added . 
he said the Russian government is committed to implementing the set of measures agreed upon with the IMF , which includes fiscal as well as structural reforms in areas such as the financial system , privatisation , agriculture , energy , anti-monopoly policy and the housing sector . 
the IMF , which assessed Russia &apos;s economic performance each month under the first year of its $ 10 billion three-year loan programme , had delayed several monthly payments this year and last year because it was worried about Moscow &apos;s ability to raise tax revenue . 
last week , it announced that it had completed its review of the state of the Russian economy and had approved the release of almost $ 700 million in loans . 
Fischer is in Tokyo to attend a two-day conference on macro-economic adjustment and economic growth .
