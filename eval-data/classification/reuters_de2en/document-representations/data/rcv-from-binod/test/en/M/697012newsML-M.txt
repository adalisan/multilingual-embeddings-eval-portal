Istanbul shares rose further on Monday amid hopes that a newly-formed secularist coalition would win a confidence vote in parliament in coming weeks , but fell from early highs on profit-taking . 
the IMKB National-100 closed at an all-time high of 1,857 , up 42 points , or 2.31 percent , from Friday &apos;s previous record close of 1,815 , but down from a trading record of 1,910 it brushed in the morning . 
it had soared 10.5 percent last week . 
&quot; Market expectations that the secularist alliance would be approved ( by President Suleyman Demirel ) were fulfilled . 
furthermore , there is psychological resistance seen at the index &apos;s 2,000 level . 
so it was normal that profit-taking emerged , &quot; said Huseyin Istanbullu from Meksa Securities . 
bond rates fell on Monday by one to 1.4 points , to 98 percent to 101 percent levels , after optimism that the new government would secure a confidence vote in parliament . 
Conservative opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz officially became the new prime minister when Demirel approved his cabinet list at midday . 
the government &apos;s programme is expected to be read in parliament next Monday , to be followed by a two-day debate and a confidence vote after a one-day break . 
Yilmaz &apos;s left-right alliance is a minority coalition of three parties that is supported by a fourth leftist party . 
overnight money rates remained high at 71.75 percent on average , compared to Friday &apos;s 71.84 percent , as banks were squeezed for cash owing to private-sector salary payments . 
the Turkish lira eased against the dollar to 148,150 at close , unchanged from the open , but weaker than Friday &apos;s close of 147,400 . 
Turkey &apos;s new state minister for the economy , Gunes Taner , said a balanced budget target set by the former Islamist-led government was not realistic and a supplementary budget would soon be needed . 
&quot; A supplementary budget will have to come before parliament soon , &quot; Taner told reporters during the handover of the state ministry . 
&quot; The balanced budget was a wrong decision , &quot; said Taner , a former economy minister and free-market champion . 
&quot; All problems will be overcome with a fine-tuning within the free-market economy , &quot; he said . 
asked about a medium-term stability programme being prepared by the former coalition government between Islamist Necmettin Erbakan and conservative Tansu Ciller , he said : &quot; We will first look at the programme that is being prepared . 
we may have some contributions , or have a separate work . 
he indicated some senior economic bureaucrats might be replaced and said : &quot; We will look into the matter of these changes . 
we are not political . 
we will work with whoever is doing his job . 
Yilmaz formed the government , still to take a vote of confidence from parliament , with the participation of a leftist and a small conservative party . 
his government is backed by another leftist party .
