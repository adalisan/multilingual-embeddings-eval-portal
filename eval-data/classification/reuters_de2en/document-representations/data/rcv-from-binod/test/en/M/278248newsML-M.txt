the dollar held at 3-1 / 2 year highs against the yen in extremely quiet European trading with interest light and dealers looking to shut up shop early ahead of the weekend . 
the yen was easier across the board against the background of a fragile Japanese stock market and intervention soon is possible , analysts said . 
&quot; Some modest intervention may well be seen soon , &quot; Chase Investment Bank said in a daily note . 
&quot; But the BoJ may wait for the G7 meeting before making a definite decision on where they will draw a line . 
at 1425 GMT the dollar was at 115.40 / 50 yen , up from an opening 114.83.93 . 
on the mark it was also firmer steady at 1.5568 / 78 against an earlier 1.5532 / 39 . 
U.S. durable goods had no real impact although they were out of line with the 0.1 percent November rise expected . 
durable goods , a notoriously volatile figure , fell 1.6 percent with ex-defence figure falling 3.4 percent and the ex-transportation sector dropping 2.2 percent . 
&quot; The larger than expected fall in the non-transportation sector may hint of some easing in demand , &quot; said Jeremy Hawkins , senior economic adviser at BankAmerica . 
&quot; Other elements are less soft , however , with both shipments and backlogs edging higher . 
overall the impression is of an industrial sector that is continuing to grow at a modest rate . 
jobless claims in the week to December 21 were lower than expected at 335,000 but this does not have major implications for the payrolls number , analysts said . 
Hawkins said overall the set of data did nothing to alter the view of steady Fed policy for a while yet . 
the mark was steady to firm on the crosses and continued to rise on the Swiss franc and got to a fresh three-year high of 86.67 centimes from 86.41 / 45 earlier . 
the mark also rose on the generally weaker yen with the pound reaching near four-year highs on the sagging Japanese currency at 194.49 . 
elsewhere sterling did well as the market continued to speculate about another monetary tightening in the near-term . 
Bank of England governor Eddie George told a French newspaper this week that he thought further U.K. interest rate rises will be necessary at some point . 
sterling / mark rose to a four-week peaks of 2.6265 marks earlier before settling in late trade at 2.6241 / 51 with cable steady at $ 1.6855 / 65 after an earlier high of $ 1.6865 . 
European trading became extremely thin as the afternoon wore on with traders looking to pack up early and head off for the weekend . 
volume will not return to anything near normal until the New Year celebrations are out of the way , dealers said .
