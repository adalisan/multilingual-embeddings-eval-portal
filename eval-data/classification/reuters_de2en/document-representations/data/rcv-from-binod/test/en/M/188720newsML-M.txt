Croatian stocks retreated to close mostly lower on Thursday in light profit taking with leading issues resisting the downward trend . 
but traders predicted that most stocks would recover as investors flocked back after the government did its best to dispel their fears last week by saying no bona fide share purchases would be challenged in its drive against fraud . 
a big contraction came a fortnight ago and share prices plummeted after a rash announcement from privatisation officials that they would annul some 9,000 employee buyout contracts which scarred away all foreign buyers . 
&quot; &apos; Black Friday &apos; is safely behind us , &quot; said Ratko Zadravec of private brokerage Zadravec , adding that traders hoped there would be no more such surprises to shake the market . 
&quot; The trading volume is increasing and stronger demand will undoubtedly pull the prices up , &quot; he added . 
volume was almost doubled at 11,210 shares on Thursday as 10 firms traded and turnover rose to 6.2 from 5.7 million kuna . 
six stocks rose and three fell while one -- blue chip Pliva pharmaceuticals -- stood firm at 13,500 kuna . 
its global depositary receipts ( GDRs ) , issued at 50 to a share , headed down to $ 51.37 on the London Stock Exchange . 
the other fully-listed issue , Zagrebacka Banka , rose 15 kuna to close at 995 on a volume of 2,770 shares after its 1 / 10 GDRs , rebounded to $ 19 each on Seaq International . 
among gainers were also hotelier Jadranturist , adding eight kuna to 288 , and confectioner Kras , up five to 525 kuna . 
Zadravec predicted that Jadranturist and food processor Podravka , which have fallen recently to what he said was a realistic bottom , would become a &quot; short-term hit &quot; among buyers . 
Podravka was the most actively traded issue with 4,449 shares sold . 
it shed four kuna to end at 226 kuna . 
the biggest of six losers was this week &apos;s debutant -- electric manufacturer Koncar -- which plunged 40 kuna to 370 . 
others included another hotel firm Riviera , which lost 25 kuna to 145 and Laguna , down another 50 kuna to 1,200 on a small volume of 27 shares . 
but traders said their decline could be nearing an end before a new rebound . 
( 5.3628 kuna = $ 1 )
