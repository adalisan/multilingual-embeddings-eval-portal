troops and tanks pulled back from the main streets of the Armenian capital Yerevan on Sunday as officials prepared to announce the final results of last weekend &apos;s presidential election . 
soldiers , sent into Yerevan on Thursday to crush opposition riots , are still guarding the central Republic Square , but they have pulled back from main thoroughfares . 
rioters were protesting against provisional election results , which gave incumbent Levon Ter-Petrosyan just over 52 percent of the vote , compared to 41 percent for the main opposition candidate , Vazgen Manukyan . 
few expect Sunday &apos;s results to change the picture significantly . 
the final figures are due after the Central Electoral Commission meets at 2 p.m. ( 1000 GMT ) . 
international observers reported instances of fraud and irregularities during the election and the count , and said most of them were committed by the president &apos;s supporters . 
but they stopped short of calling the vote unfair . 
Ter-Petrosyan has said the riots which followed the early election results was an attempted &quot; fascist &quot; coup by &quot; mentally ill people &quot; . 
as well as dispatching troops , he closed the headquarters of some opposition parties who say dozens of their members have been rounded up by the authorities . 
opposition figures deny they planned a coup . 
Western diplomats said at least 200 people had been arrested in a crackdown on the opposition . 
Ter-Petrosyan aide Jerair Liparityan has said details of arrests will be issued later .
