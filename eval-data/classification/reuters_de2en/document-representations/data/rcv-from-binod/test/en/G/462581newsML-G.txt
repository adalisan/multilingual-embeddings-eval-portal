when Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown made the first trip on his election &quot; battlebus &quot; , his choice of Abingdon as a destination could have been seen as ominous for the ruling Conservatives . 
for the old market town near Oxford is the birthplace of a movement which could worsen any defeat the ruling party is set to suffer in Britain &apos;s May 1 general election . 
GROT -- Get rid of them -- is appealing to Britons who want Prime Minister John Major out of power to vote for whichever centre-left candidate is more likely to defeat the Conservative in their particular constituency , under the first-past-the-post electoral system . 
in most Conservative seats , that will be the nominee of Tony Blair &apos;s Labour Party , which opinion polls show heading for the biggest landslide for a left-leaning party since 1945 . 
in a few , including the seat of Oxford West and Abingdon , it will be the candidate of Ashdown &apos;s minority party . 
GROT was founded by Bruce Kent , the Labour candidate in the constituency at the 1992 general election , after he polled 7,652 votes , just over twice the margin by which Conservative John Patten won the seat against a strong Liberal challenge . 
&quot; Bruce Kent got that tactical voting message when standing here last time , &quot; Evan Harris , a 31-year-old doctor who is prospective Liberal candidate , as he waited in the rain to welcome Ashdown to Abingdon on Monday . 
&quot; People seem to have taken it to heart because despite Labour &apos;s showing nationally , its vote has been falling here in local elections . 
I believe it is going to be very close between us and the Conservatives in May . 
the Liberals now hold 37 of the 59 local council seats in the constituency , against just 13 for Labour . 
even a town centre confectionery shop selling chocolate models of the party leaders confirmed that in Abingdon the battle is between Conservatives and Liberals -- assistants told Ashdown he was easily outselling Blair and not far short of Major . 
aides to Ashdown insist that while the opinion polls show the party well below the 18 percent of the vote it won in 1992 , support in seats it can realistically win -- perhaps 50 of the 659 being fought -- is holding up . 
it currently holds just 20 . 
if they are right , and if voters prove receptive to the arguments for tactical voting , Labour and the Liberal Democrats could catch the Conservatives in a pincer movement . 
the dramatic effects of this have already been seen in parliamentary by-elections held since 1992 . 
in 1993 at Newbury , some 20 miles ( 32 km ) south of Abingdon , Labour won just two percent of the vote as the Liberals overturned a large Conservative majority to take the seat . 
Ashdown himself was reluctant to deploy the tactical vote argument during his Abingdon visit , preferring to stress that only his party was prepared to increase taxes to push through vital improvements to education and health services . 
but Liberals in &quot; battleground &quot; seats -- mainly in western England -- will emphasise the facts of local life . 
in at least one seat , monthly newsletters delivered to voters for the past year have all included a chart showing the 1992 voting figures , under the slogan &quot; Labour cannot win here &quot; . 
&quot; If voters don &apos;t get the message , it won &apos;t be through lack of trying , &quot; an aide to Ashdown said .
