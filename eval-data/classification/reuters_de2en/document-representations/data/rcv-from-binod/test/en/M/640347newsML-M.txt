U.S. exporters contacted by Reuters said they could not confirm rumors that swept through cash and futures markets that China bought 100,000 tonnes U.S. old crop soybeans for prompt delivery on Wednesday night . 
Rumors also had China seeking more U.S. soybeans . 
some U.S. exporters doubted the sale occurred , citing price and full bookings at least until September . 
&quot; Brazilian soybeans are still cheaper , &quot; one exporter said . 
for July position , Argentine soybeans Upriver were quoted at $ 303.15 a tonne , fob . 
Brazilian beans , Paranagua , were at $ 292.10 and U.S. No . 
2 soybeans , Gulf of Mexico , were $ 313.40 . 
at 1217 CDT , Chicago Board of Trade July soybean futures were up 7-1 / 2 cents at $ 837-1 / 2 a bushel , partly supported by rumors of Chinese interest , traders said . 
&quot; You would think they would go after Brazilian beans first . 
it &apos;s possible yes , but it is unlikely , &quot; the exporter said . 
&quot; But it seems to me that a lot of these private companies are covered for the nearby positions . 
its June 5 , and I think whatever they are buying now would be for September forward , &quot; the exporter added . 
in the past , China has bought both Brazilian and U.S. soybeans . 
they have bought Brazilian beans because of price but also U.S. soybeans because of quality , the exporter noted . 
&quot; Take your pick as to which is more important . 
a second exporter said he had not seen any major movement . 
they are still better priced , &quot; he said . 
a third exporter said he heard China was probably going to go for South American beans . 
&quot; I would say it was highly unlikely , &quot; Smith Barney oilseed and grain analyst Dale Gustafson said of a China purchase of U.S. soybeans . 
&quot; We are looking at a very significant differential from what you can buy out of Brazil and what you can get out of the United States . 
he added he did not believe there were any significant shipping delays out of Brazil . 
&quot; So , if that ( shipping ) is not an issue , price is usually the determining factor , &quot; Gustafson said .
