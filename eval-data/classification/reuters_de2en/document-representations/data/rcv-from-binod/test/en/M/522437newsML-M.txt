German debt prices wavered at Friday &apos;s open before slipping into negative ground with dealers reporting very light early trade . 
&quot; The market is very lacklustre , &quot; said a trader in Frankfurt . 
&quot; The future is consolidating . 
it has eased off a bit after yesterday &apos;s move , and I expect the market will remain quiet this session . 
&quot; After a spirited attempt on Thursday to break above 101.13 resistance , the DTB June Bund future retreated in late trade . 
analysts said the failure to conquer that barrier would signal a brief setback this session for the future to gather pace . 
by 0701 GMT , the June contract was trading 12 basis points lower at 100.81 , just above first support at 100.80 , where the contract plotted a low on daily charts on Thursday . 
the main technical upside target for the contract remained at 101.13 , analysts said , where the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the decline from 103.20 to 99.06 kicks in . 
while the market had a good fundamental base to push higher -- particularly after comments from the Bundesbank on Thursday -- players said the lack of impetus from the U.S. this session , with no major data due , would leave Bunds uninspired . 
Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said on Thursday that he saw no reason for any change in German monetary policy in the foreseeable future . 
the central bank chief also said that recent strong growth in M3 money supply presented no inflationary danger . 
March M3 data are expected to be released in the next few sessions , with some analysts expecting the figure as early as today . 
money supply growth is seen continuing its downward path after it slipped to 9.1 percent in February , but is expected to remain well outside the Bundesbank &apos;s target range of 3.5 to 6.5 percent . 
but analysts said that the number was unlikely to have too great a negative impact on Bunds . 
&quot; Bunds should be able to take a strong M3 figure in their stride as Bundesbank tightening is virtually ruled out for the rest of the year given the sluggishness of the economic recovery and the lack of price pressures , &quot; said one . 
in the cash market the 10-year benchmark Bund was weaker in early trade , offering a 5.830 percent yield at a price of 101.16 . 
Bunds also lost out to treasuries , slimming the 10-year yield gap to 114 basis points from 116 at Thursday &apos;s close .
