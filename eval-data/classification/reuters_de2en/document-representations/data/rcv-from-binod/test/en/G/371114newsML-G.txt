the SLA sources said the captives , all inhabitants of the border zone , were released from Khiam jail on Monday on the occasion of the Moslem feast of EID al-Fitr ending the fasting month of Ramadan . 
eight Khiam prisoners were released on January 12 . 
the latest releases brought to 177 the number of prisoners freed from the jail in two years . 
about 145 Lebanese and other Arabs are still held without trial at the hilltop prison . 
the Khiam prisoners are mostly anti-Israeli guerrillas , villagers who refuse to pay taxes to the SLA and people who refuse to let their sons be conscripted into the SLA . 
some 1,000 Israeli troops and the 3,000-strong SLA hold the 15-km ( nine-miles ) -wide south Lebanon zone to prevent cross-border raids on northern Israel .
