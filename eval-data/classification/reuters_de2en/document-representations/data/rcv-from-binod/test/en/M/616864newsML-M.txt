futures moved back down after strong May U.S. consumer confidence that jumped to 28-yr high of 127.1 vs forecasts for 118.1 . 
strong data more than offset soft April existing home sales . 
June marks dipped below support at $ 0.5890 , or 1.70 spot , and probed trendline support near $ 0.5885 area . 
technical sales periodically kicked in , extending the overall decline that weighed down currencies vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar and individually in crosses on uneasiness over Europe &apos;s planned convergence into a single currency unit . 
comments at midday by French National Assembly speaker Phillip Seguin reignited the mark &apos;s selloff . 
Seguin , in a magazine interview to be published Wednesday , said he opposes a precise , &quot; apothecary &apos;s &quot; approach to entry conditions for the European Monetary Unit and that the maximum number of countries must participate . 
Seguin &apos;s remarks followed Sunday &apos;s first-round French balloting that gave a strong showing for the French left-wing parties . 
on Monday , French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said he would resign regardless of the outcome of next Sunday &apos;s balloting . 
traders said a Socialist government could push for a broader-based EMU entry , which would weigh down marks . 
Swiss francs skidded to big losses , pressured by crosses and after comments early Tuesday by Swiss National Bank officials , who reiterated unhappiness with the Swiss franc &apos;s strength and suggested that Swiss rates could head lower . 
that , coupled with the still-generous Swiss liquidity , pounded the Swiss unit lower . 
the U.K. government denied rumors that circulated during Asian trading about sterling &apos;s return to the ERM . 
U.K &apos;s Treasury said new U.K. trade chief Margaret Beckett had told a Tokyo television station that Britain was not discussing the issue of ERM membership , but that a translation error led to reports that she had said a return to the ERM was possible . 
marks breached several key technical support bands , notably the $ 0.5890 or 1.70 spot level , and approached next support near $ 0.5855 , or 1.71 . 
futures also lost ground Tuesday after May U.S. consumer confidence jumped to a 28-year high , far stronger than expected . 
June yen ended down $ 0.000072 at $ 0.008592 , marks lost $ 0.0049 to $ 0.5866 , Swiss fell $ 0.0098 to $ 0.7048 , sterling fell $ 0.0046 to $ 1.6302 , Canada dropped $ 0.0047 to $ 0.7238 , Aussie dollar eased $ 0.0010 to $ 0.7643 , and Mexican peso fell $ 0.000250 to $ 0.125600 . 
the French franc lost $ 0.00180 to $ 0.17360 but volume for June futures was estimated at only 354 contracts .
