following are economists &apos; reactions to New Zealand September quarter GDP data published on Thursday . 
Seasonally-adjusted production-based Gross Domestic Product rose 0.6 percent for the quarter and the annual average rate was 2.3 percent , versus economists &apos; forecasts of 0.2 percent and 2.25 percent respectively . 
thirty minutes after the data were released , the New Zealand dollar was trading at US $ 0.7031 / 38 versus 0.7039 / 46 shortly beforehand , while 90-day bank bill rates were at 7.35 percent versus 7.32 percent . 
I was expecting to see upward revisions of previous growth , but they &apos;ve actually revised the year to March down slightly . 
plank noted that manufactured exports were up , despite the strength of the New Zealand dollar . 
&quot; The bottomline number is stronger than expected but if you go through and look at why it is as strong as it is , then I don &apos;t think there is anything in there to shock anyone . 
&quot; If you take out that big lumpy investment which most people knew about but never fully built into their numbers , it gets rid of a point or two . 
I suspect people underestimated just how much was coming out of the dairy sector . 
if you look underneath that and say &apos; structurally how strong is the economy ? 
&apos; , manufacturing excluding dairy was very flat , retailing was flat to negative . 
look at investment minus an oil tanker and it is negative . 
it is 
a very flat economy . 
statistics NZ said the rise in business investment for the quarter was mainly the result of the one-off import of an oil tanker for use at the Maui-B rig . 
Toplis said the figures were historical and would not have any impact on the government &apos;s accounts . 
&quot; It &apos;s ancient history . 
someone might get excited short-term and see a bigger number and decide it &apos;s a reason they can &apos;t loosen monetary policy for another week . 
overall I would be very surprised if it changed anyone &apos;s views . 
Marshall said he expected December quarter growth to be well down and for that quarter to be the turning point in the cycle . 
he said the September quarter figure did not change his outlook . 
&quot; December quarter will be flat and the March and June quarters will be fairly flat as well . 
Marshall said little inference could be drawn from the outcome given the historical nature of the series . 
&quot; Imports looks an interesting result to rise only 0.9 percent . 
that will be one to look at a bit deeper to see what the volume was . 
it was such a small rise when the exchange rate rose by 4.7 percent in the quarter , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It was a little bit higher than expected but a lot of the growth went into stock building so it &apos;s not necessarily a sign of strength . 
&quot; If consumption and domestic demand don &apos;t pick up , then all of a sudden you are left with all this stock which implies weakness further down the track . 
&quot; I still think there is some weakness there , especially in the primary and productive areas like manufacturing . 
what &apos;s holding our numbers up is a very strong services sector . 
&quot; That trend has been continuing for a year now and we are still a few months away from a pick-up . 
asked how the Reserve Bank would view the numbers , he said : &quot; I don &apos;t think it has any significant implications for monetary policy . 
he said the September quarter data was historical and the market was likely to focus on the more recent sectoral indicators for an indication of the economy &apos;s performance . 
&quot; I think the &apos; mixed &apos; word is going to come into the vocabulary . 
it is pretty patchy . 
he said some retailers had a good Christmas and others said it was poor , so overall it was likely to have been flat . 
&quot; It certainly helps explain a little bit why inflation &apos;s been so persistent . 
&quot; going through the components , it &apos;s nothing that should upset the Reserve Bank ... Gross national expenditure , in other words domestic expenditure , is only 0.3 for the quarter and most of that &apos;s made up of investment , with private consumption and government consumption down . 
so as far as inflation-reducing stuff goes , it &apos;s about as good as you can get , and exports running ahead of imports , so that &apos;s pretty good from the RB &apos;s perspective .
