emerging market investors will be digesting U.S. data this week for signs that rates may rise , while politicking in Russia and Brazil and unrest in South Korea and Bulgaria will add to uncertainty , say strategists . 
U.S. Treasury markets stabilised on Monday after long bond yields soared on Friday but with U.S. retail sales and consumer price data due on Tuesday , investors are watching for signs that interest rates there may rise . 
&quot; I think it is premature to say this means the Fed will tighten soon , but it brings forward the possibility and makes it more certain that the next move is upwards , &quot; said Richard Gray , emerging market analyst at BankAmerica . 
Latin America &apos;s stock markets , with their close ties to the U.S. economy , will feel the pain from a U.S. rate rise mainly if it impacts on Wall Street . 
but Argentine debt , and to a lesser extent Mexico &apos;s , is more vulnerable since the Argentine peso is pegged to the dollar . 
Argentina begins roadshows for a $ 2 billion dual tranche global bond this week , and Gray said Friday &apos;s U.S. data may make its launch more difficult . 
&quot; It is now a more awkward market , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They are not going to have a lot of comfort until the Fed tightens . 
the earliest this could happen is at the February 4 meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve , though Gray thought the Fed may hold off until March . 
the growing consensus over the direction of U.S. interest rates coincides with events in individual developing countries like Russia and Brazil , both facing key weeks for their leaders . 
&quot; I &apos;m still concerned about the health of President ( Boris ) Yeltsin , &quot; said Ousmene Mandeng , emerging market strategist at WestMerchant , after the sickly Russian president unnerved debt markets last week when he was taken to hospital with pneumonia . 
the news failed to dent equity markets which soared to highs on strong trading volume . 
the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) returns to Moscow today for talks on the economy which investors hope will lead to the release of a delayed loan tranche . 
meanwhile the re-election dreams of Brazil &apos;s President Fernando Henrique Cardoso face their first hurdle this week in the form of a legislative committee vote . 
foreign investors are starting to anticipate the likelihood of the necessary constitutional amendment being passed . 
&quot; The re-election bill in Brazil is increasingly likely to be passed by Congress , possibly as early as ( this ) week , &quot; ANZ Grindlays said in a note to investors . 
others , however , are waiting for Brazil &apos;s December import figures , also this week , to complete the month &apos;s trade balance picture after the release last week of export data that analysts said looked reasonable . 
Bulgaria &apos;s new socialist prime minister , Nikolai Dobrev , is still under pressure from mass protests and a faltering economy . 
&quot; The market is looking for more evidence along those lines , &quot; WestMerchant &apos;s Mandeng said . 
&quot; The problem there is that it &apos;s a guessing game -- there is just so little information . 
against a background of anti-Socialist strikes , Dobrev is under pressure to take the IMF-backed steps that would haul it back from the brink of default on its Brady debt . 
while Peru &apos;s markets have held up reasonably well during the on-going hostage crisis , the pressure is still on President Alberto Fujimori . 
&quot; So far debt prices have come down but not tremendously and that is a sign people do believe the crisis will be solved and that Peru &apos;s situation will not be undermined significantly , &quot; said one strategist . 
&quot; But if there is bloodshed then it may be that that perception has to be revised . 
others say fear the incident could threaten Peru &apos;s economy . 
&quot; This terrorist incident is likely to shake investor and consumer confidence , and could potentially threaten the expected recovery , &quot; Foreign &amp; colonial strategists said . 
but F &amp; C for one said it did not believe the government would have to backtrack on the new labour law that sparked the strife . 
&quot; The new law is in fact positive for the long term and we do not believe that the government will be forced to negotiate on the issue , &quot; it said . 
Latin America was up 6.0 percent week on week at 567.54 , Asia was up 2.4 percent at 258.48 , and Europe , Middle East and Africa as a region was up 4.1 at 139.75 .
