abandoning blood testing at the elite Golden Four athletics meetings is just the latest sign that officials are retreating in the war on drugs . 
the meetings in Oslo , Zurich , Brussels and Berlin , leading events on the grand Prix circuit , introduced blood testing amid much fanfare when they were launched in 1993 . 
now blood tests , widely regarded as a significant advance in the war on dope cheats , have quietly been dropped . 
&quot; We stopped the blood tests because there didn &apos;t seem any point in continuing , &quot; said Wilfried Meert , director of the Ivo van Damme meeting in Brussels . 
&quot; We expected the international federation to introduce a new rule that allowed blood testing , that our tests would be a first step . 
&quot; But that never happened . 
and the International amateur Athletic Federation &apos;s ( IAAF ) own experts kept telling us that urine samples give just as good results . 
&quot; There were also difficult legal aspects . 
we never received the results of the tests -- there was no reason why we should -- but in the end it was very expensive and we agreed that it is the sort of initiative that ought to come out of the international federations , not from individual meeting organisers . 
results from analysing 99 samples taken over the first two seasons were only recently released in the specialist medical magazine International Journal of Sports Medicine . 
the findings indicated that three of 36 women athletes tested has testosterone levels above the normal range , including one which was three times above the accepted level . 
the presence of extra testosterone , the male sex hormone , could lead to a four-year suspension if detected under the IAAF &apos;s standard urine analysis . 
however , no disciplinary action could be taken because the IAAF &apos;s rule have never allowed for blood testing . 
since the Golden Four is contested by some of the world &apos;s top athletes , the three positive tests may have included world record holders or Olympic champions . 
but when the world &apos;s pre-eminent sports body appears to back down from taking action against drug cheats , it may be expecting too much of meeting promoters to take a stand . 
last year the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) was forced to admit it had thrown out five steroid positives discovered during the Atlanta Games . 
the five ignored positives followed the investment of $ 3,000,000 in much vaunted new machinery which eventually proved far less effective and reliable than had been hoped . 
only two athletes , both non-medallists , were sanctioned at the centenary Games after nearly 2,000 tests . 
as Don Catlin , director of the IOC-accredited drug-testing laboratory at the University of California who was called in to help supervise testing in Atlanta , said : &quot; I don &apos;t think everyone in Atlanta was doped , but the sophisticated athlete who wants to take drugs has switched to things we can &apos;t test for . 
the latest trend for dope cheats is to use hormones occurring naturally in the body , leaving the burden of proof with the authorities to show that the substance was admnistered . 
most common of these are testosterone , insulin , human growth hormone ( hGH ) and crythropoietin ( EPO ) . 
in underground steroid-users &apos; leaflest , the Atlanta Olympics were openly referred to as &quot; The Growth Hormone Games &quot; . 
competitors are prepared to pay around $ 1,500 a month for hGH because it allows their muscles to recover quickly from intense efforts , allowing them to train harder and more frequently . 
above all , it is undetectable by urine analysis . 
&quot; I wish we could just announce that we &apos;d got a test for hGH and will be using it in Atlanta , &quot; said one frustrated British doping control official before the Olympics . 
&quot; I &apos;d like to see who pulled out of the team then , &quot; 
in an attempt to put an end to such abuses , researchers in Sweden , Denmark , Italy and in London have embarked on a five-year project called GH 2000 to devise an acceptable test for hGH through urine analysis in time for the Sydney Olympics . 
the researchers had expected the IOC &apos;s cooperation and were promised the remnants of urine samples taken in Atlanta , by far the most widespread test base available during the four-year Olympic cycle . 
nine months after the Olympic flame was extinguished in Atlanta , the researchers are still waiting for the samples to be delivered . 
such maladministration raises serious doubts over the the desire of senior sports officials to clamp down on drug use , particularly when millions of dollars of sponsors &apos; money are invested in sport . 
Robert Voy , medical adviser to the U.S. Olympic Committee until he resigned after the 1988 Olympics , disillusioned with double standards on drugs , is one such sceptic . 
&quot; The IOC fears exposing the high levels of drug use , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It turns off the public . 
sports bodies are also nervous about legal challenges . 
this week in Toronto Ben Johnson , the most notorious drug cheat ever , takes on the IAAF . 
no matter that Johnson , disqualified after winning the 1988 Olympic 100 metres final , has been caught cheating twice . 
nor that he has testified to prolonged use of performance-enhancing drugs . 
this may all count for nothing if a judge in Canada determines the sprinter is entitled to run for money , thereby rendering the sports anti-doping rule unenforceable . 
this is already the case elsewhere . 
some athletes are being banned for two years for steroid offences , others suspended for four years for the same offence simply because they come from countries with different legal systems . 
this weekend the IAAF holds a congress meeting in Athens , venue of the August world championships . 
high on the agenda is the case of Haralambros Papadias and two other Greek athletes , who refused an out-of-competition drug test while training in Dortmund . 
despite the prospect of a four-year ban , Papadias has since gone on to win the world indoor 60 metres title . 
the world governing body has withheld his winner &apos;s purse pending an investigation and is considering a new rule which will give it the power to overrule national governing bodies who fail to impose sanctions on athletes .
