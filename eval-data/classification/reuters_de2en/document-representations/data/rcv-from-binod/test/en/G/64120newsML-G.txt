Hong Kong shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa said he would make a decision within two to three weeks on whether he would enter the race to be Hong Kong &apos;s first China-appointed chief executive . 
Tung , at the centre of intense speculation that he is a front runner to become leader of Hong Kong when the British depart next year , called a news conference on Thursday but left the vital answer dangling . 
&quot; I am very actively considering it and actively preparing for it , &quot; the billionaire told a news conference . 
Tung , 59 , chairman of shipping giant Orient Overseas ( International ) Ltd , said he was preparing to make &quot; suitable arrangements &quot; for the running of his business empire so that he could give his full attention to the task ahead . 
he said he would relinquish his business responsibilities if he does decide to proceed . 
&quot; I think to be chief executive of Hong Kong is a huge responsibility . 
it &apos;s not a decision to be taken lightly . 
he said he would canvass a wide range of opinion to prepare himself should he decide to stand . 
&quot; The purpose of this statement is there has been so much speculation I thought it only right to make my position clearly known , &quot; Tung told the news conference . 
Tung urged more candidates to put themselves forward to provide a greater choice . 
two candidates have committed themselves so far , although the China-appointed panel responsible for making the decision has yet to be established . 
it is expected to be formulated in time to choose the Chief Executive-designate by November . 
sovereignty of the British colony of Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight on June 30 , 1997 . 
public opinion polls put Governor Chris Patten &apos;s deputy , Anson Chan , far ahead of the field , although Chan &apos;s name has not been put tossed into the ring . 
declared candidate , former Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang , ranks second in the popularity stakes ahead of Lo Tak-shing , a solicitor and the first to declare an interest .
