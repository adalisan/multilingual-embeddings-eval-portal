April 28 settlement prev settlement 
key December three-month Euroyen interest rate futures finished the TIFFE day session firmer as participants who went short on Friday covered their positions ahead of a national holiday on Tuesday , market sources said . 
but there was a solid ceiling at 99.00 after Bank of Japan Governor Matsushita said this morning there was concern about prices and after the release of better-than-expected government forecasts for industrial output in April and May , traders said . 
the December settled up 0.02 at 98.98 on Monday after moving between 99.94 and 99.99 . 
turnover was 42,870 contracts . 
&quot; There is a high possibility that the Japanese economy will continue to recover . 
we will see how the weak yen and improving supply-demand conditions will affect prices in Japan , &quot; Matsushita told a news conference this morning after Sunday &apos;s meeting of the Group of Seven ( G7 ) industrial nations . 
traders said this is Matsushita &apos;s second such remark on prices since last week . 
a view also spread that the economic recovery was not hurt so badly as many had expected by a rise in Japan &apos;s sales tax from April 1 , they said . 
Japan &apos;s industrial production in March fell a preliminary 1.5 percent from the previous month , the trade ministry said . 
the ministry also said it forecast industrial output to rise 1.9 percent in April and to rise 1.1 percent in May . 
&quot; The data suggested the negative effect from the tax rise was limited , &quot; said a city bank dealer . 
&quot; This failed to have an impact today as the market was led by pre-holiday position adjustments . 
but it will keep the topside heavy in the long run . 
&quot; The contract is likely to move within a range between 98.90 and 99.00 unless the market factors in a rate rise of a half a point by December , traders said . 
it is at the level before the BOJ &apos;s &quot; tankan &quot; corporate survey showed weak business sentiment among non-manufacturers and small corporations . 
the key overnight call rate rose to 0.50 percent as banks &apos; fund-raising demand was solid ahead of the month-end . 
Friday &apos;s weighted average was 0.48 percent . 
the BOJ retained its accommodative credit stance on Monday by leaving the market in surplus of some 190 billion yen . 
the benchmark three-month certificates of deposit ( CDs ) were issued at an unchanged 0.56 percent in a small volume of 10 billion yen.--Risa Maeda Tokyo Treasury Desk + 81-33432-8570 .
