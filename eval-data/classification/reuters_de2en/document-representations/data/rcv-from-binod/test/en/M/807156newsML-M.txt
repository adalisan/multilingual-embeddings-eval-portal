September gilt futures on LIFFE will have a smooth day on Monday , unperturbed by turmoil on world equities markets as they attempt to recapture the 115-00 zone , technical analysts said . 
the upmove will not be vigorous however . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s going to be a slow and trudging kind of move , &quot; Gerry Celaya , senior technical analyst at American Express Bank in London , said . 
the market will first target the August 13 high of 114-31 for a push through to the psychological barrier at 115-00 . 
on Friday it reached 114-29 but stalled . 
Celaya saw intermediate support at Friday &apos;s low of 114-09 and congestion at 114-03,04 . 
charts show lows around here on August 5 , 6 and 11 . 
Clark at RBS said the dominant theme on the short sterling charts remains the large white candle that formed on August 7 after the last Bank of England interest rate rise , although the market has failed to capitalise on the bull signal . 
the longer prices languish around the 92.59 area the harder it will be to regain momentum , she said . 
the market will likely remain in a 92.59 to 92.67 range short term .
