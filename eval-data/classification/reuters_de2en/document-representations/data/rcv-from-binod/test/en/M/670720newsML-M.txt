Swedish debt yields closed lower on Wednesday , inspired by a forecast for Sweden &apos;s 1998 state borrowing need from the National Debt Office ( NDO ) . 
the NDO estimated a borrowing requirement between minus 10 to zero billion crowns for 1998 . 
&quot; It was taken positively by the market as it confirms the Finance Minister &apos;s projection of a budget surplus next year , &quot; said one dealer . 
data showing industrial production falling 2.6 percent in April after a 3.0 percent rise in March added to the positive mood . 
capacity utilisation also fell in the first quarter to 87.0 percent from 87.9 percent in the fourth quarter 1996 . 
the six-month T-bill rate closed two basis points lower at 4.13 percent and ten-year bond yield ended three basis points down at 6.81 percent . 
the spread between Swedish and German ten-year bond yields narrowed four basis points to 106 . 
the crown firmed against both the mark and the dollar . 
dealers said small but steady buying from Swedish export companies supported the crown as more speculative players started to slow down ahead of the summer holidays . 
the mark eased to 4.4700 crowns from 4.4790 crowns late Tuesday .
