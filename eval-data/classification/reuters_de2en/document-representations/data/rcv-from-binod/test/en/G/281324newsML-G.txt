the crowd cheered as four Arab women modelled Palestinian-designed evening and wedding gowns at the West Bank &apos;s first fashion show . 
&quot; This is the first Palestine International Festival for elegance and Beauty and it is a success , &quot; said Iyad Qashou , manager of al-Siraj theatre where the event took place . 
Western pop music played in the background while the amateur models took to the stage wearing traditional Palestinian embroidered dresses and colourful evening gowns . 
the audience was a mix of young Palestinian men -- some sporting ponytails -- and veiled , religious Moslem women . 
the fashion show and the beauty festival attracted Palestinians from all over the West Bank , parts of which are under self-rule . 
Ramallah , known for its liberal atmosphere , has become the centre of social and cultural attractions for Palestinians in the West Bank , including Arab East Jerusalem . 
discos , bars and Chinese , Italian and Mexican restaurants opened in Ramallah soon after Israeli troops pulled out . 
PLO officials , most of whom had returned from exile where they were exposed to Western culture , discouraged militancy that had prevailed under occupation . 
even in Gaza , a bastion of traditional Moslem values , nightlife and cultural events have mushroomed . 
gypsy belly dancers entertaining Gazans in beachfront restaurants and cafes have become a common sight . 
alcohol , prohibited in Islam , can now be served to customers in a few Gaza restaurants . 
more women are now driving cars and swimming -- a sport prohibited by militant Moslems who dominated Gaza society before PLO rule in 1994 . 
Palestinians in the West Bank cities of Nablus and Bethlehem have started eating out and taking their families to parks and on picnics . 
Palestinian businessmen have invested in new restaurants and bars . 
after the PLO &apos;s takeover of major West Bank cities , Palestinian police in many cases punished people who tried to infringe on the personal freedom of others , such as harassing women swimming or dancing in public places . 
at the Ramallah fashion show , dozens crowded the theatre in the town centre . 
Palestinian fashion designer Inaam Issa said the models were her daughter and her friends at school . 
&quot; This is the first fashion show in Ramallah , and I &apos;m so encouraged by its success that I decided to hold another one next April , &quot; Issa told Reuters . 
&quot; People here nowadays , especially the young , are moving towards the Western styles and fashions , so my dresses are not traditional . 
I also have put a few modern touches to the Palestinian embroidered dress so it can be worn anytime of the day , &quot; she said . 
Issa said the &quot; end of Israeli occupation and the openness encouraged by the Palestinian Authority &quot; has helped her and others &quot; to open up to life &quot; . 
Palestinian hairstylists and Arab models from northern Israel also participated in the Ramallah festival . 
model Rana Raslan said it was her first visit to Ramallah , &quot; which came about because we have peace , and I love it . 
it is very exciting . 
modelling was not confined to women . 
teenage boys sat on stage , some chewing gum , as male hairstylists cut their hair in a styling contest .
