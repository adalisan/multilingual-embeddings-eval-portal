a leading Kuwaiti opposition parliamentarian was recovering in hospital on Saturday a day after unidentified gunmen shot him and his wife . 
&quot; Thank God Abdullah al-Naibari is doing well , &quot; a relative told Reuters . 
gunmen ambushed the car of the fierce government critic on Friday as he drove back to Kuwait City from a beach near the southern border with Saudi Arabia . 
Naibari was hit in the jaw and shoulder by bullets while his wife suffered a superficial bullet wound near her left shoulder . 
both are being treated at the Adan Hospital , south of Kuwait City . 
diplomats said Western embassies in the tiny Gulf Arab state were assessing the security situation , especially the American and British missions . 
William Cohen is due to make his first visit to Kuwait as U.S. Defence Secretary in mid-June while British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett is expected to come to Kuwait on June 23 . 
&quot; Each ( attack ) event is studied in search of a pattern , &quot; said a Western diplomat . 
&quot; As of yet there appears to be no pattern or indication who was behind the attack &quot; . 
diplomats said both visits were expected to take place on schedule . 
officials told Reuters two cars were involved in the attack on Naibari , 61 , who underwent surgery late on Friday . 
his vehicle was sprayed with bullets . 
&quot; This is a scare tactic , &quot; said a Western diplomat . 
&quot; They want to shut him and other MPs up . 
he has been very strong in his attacks on the so called &apos; thieves of public funds &apos; &quot; . 
several MPs , of various affiliations , said the attack was politically motivated by what they called the enemies of democracy whose interests were damaged by parliament &apos;s relentless questioning about the country &apos;s vast oil wealth and lucrative arms deals . 
they did not name anyone . 
Parliament &apos;s Saturday session is expected to be dedicated to debates about the attack . 
the government has condemned the shooting and promised to conduct an intensive inquiry to secure the arrest of the gunmen . 
Kuwait , which controls about 10 percent of the world &apos;s proven oil reserves , is the only one of the six conservative Sunni Moslem-ruled Gulf Arab states with an elected parliament . 
fellow liberal MP Sami al-Munayes said : &quot; It is a battle between right and wrong and defending the people &apos;s rights . 
&quot; He urged the government &quot; to strike with an iron fist , with deeds and not words , &quot; at all forms of corruption . 
Naibari played a key role in parliamentary efforts to combat what the opposition described as graft and mismanagement of state funds . 
he was also among leaders of a movement demanding the restoration of parliament dissolved in 1986 . 
general elections were held in 1992 , more than a year after a U.S.-led military coalition ended Iraq &apos;s seven-month occupation of Kuwait .
