the dollar opened lower as worries about Japan &apos;s trade surplus resurfaced and the mark surged in Europe amid fears France &apos;s new government might drag its heels on currency union , dealers said . 
dollar / yen slumped to a six-month low at 111.80 , before rebounding somewhat in Tokyo , after selling in the wake of Friday &apos;s remarks on Japan &apos;s trade surplus by U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky spilled over on Monday . 
&quot; That started the ball rolling , &quot; said Bob Near , a vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Bank of New York . 
&quot; Then yesterday and today the ( European Union ) finance ministers &apos; meeting is going on in Luxembourg , and France officially asked for a delay in consideration of the stability pact , &quot; Near continued . 
dollar / mark abruptly fell more than a pfennig to 1.7095 in European midday trade , dealers said . 
the greenback took the brunt of a surge in mark / French and other mark crosses after France &apos;s Socialist-led government threw the EU into a conniption on Monday by asking its European partners for time to consult with the National Assembly over the budget stability pact for the proposed euro . 
the new French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn told his EU counterparts that Paris wanted time to reflect on the as-yet unratified plan , agreed to in Dublin in December , to contain budget deficits after the single currency debuts . 
&quot; We &apos;re not seeking to renegotiate the stability pact , but we cannot approve it today , &quot; Strauss-Kahn told a news conference . 
French stocks sank after the news and mark / French jumped the 3.38 barrier . 
dealers speculated the weak French franc could draw the Bank of France quietly into the market . 
&quot; Over 3.38 ( mark / French ) , that &apos;s got to be somewhat worrisome . 
I would expect we would find some resistance if we got near 3.3850 or certainly 3.3875 , &quot; said Frank Pusateri , a vice president at Mellon Bank in Boston . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t be surprised to see the Bank of France getting a little nervous and try to bring things back a little bit , if they can , &quot; he added . 
the dollar opened at 1.7125 / 35 marks , down from 1.7245 / 50 at Friday &apos;s close . 
dollar / yen opened at 112.45 / 50 , down from 114.33 / 43 on Friday . 
speculation Japan &apos;s trade surplus would be discussed by Group of Seven finance ministers when they gather in Denver on June 20 shoved the dollar down more than two yen in Asia . 
Barshefsky sparked the refreshed concerns on Friday after she said the U.S. was worried about the potential for a rise in Japan &apos;s bilateral trade surplus with the U.S. 
dollar / yen &apos;s recovered somewhat after Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and his deputy Tadashi Ogawa stepped in with market-soothing remarks calling for stable exchange rates . 
Japan &apos;s April current account numbers are due out on Wednesday and economists expect the overall surplus to expand due to a decline in imports and sluggish domestic demand .
