China &apos;s grains markets remained oblivious to news of leader Deng Xiaoping &apos;s death , with traders anxiously watching storage space run out at Chinese ports as soymeal and beans continued to arrive , grain sources said . 
&quot; Deng &apos;s death had no effect on trade , &quot; said a Hong Kong-based trader . 
soybean and meal markets were very quiet with few enquiries heard . 
no new deals for meal were heard concluded on Thursday , with traders pointing to high international prices and low domestic prices . 
Chicago Board of Trade soymeal dipped on Wednesday , halting a steady march upwards with March meal off $ 2.20 at $ 253.40 per tonne , but traders said prices remained far too high for Chinese buying . 
instead , the lack of available storage facilities at China &apos;s ports preoccupied traders . 
thousands of tonnes of meal still arriving at Chinese ports meant warehouses were running out of space , industry sources agreed . 
&quot; A lot of the meal is simply out in the open , increasing the danger of rotting , &quot; a senior Chinese trader said , noting that demand was light in the post Chinese New Year period . 
bad weather with constant rain and cold in southern ports worsened conditions , the trader said . 
&quot; The situation at Shanghai , Guangzhou , Shekou , Zhanjiang , and Beihai ( ports ) , are all about the same , &quot; he noted , adding that continued bad weather would exacerbate the situation . 
if companies were unable to arrange storage , they may decide to slash prices and sell the meal , one trader noted . 
a 50,000-tonne cargo of U.S. meal was heard discharging at Shanghai , while a cargo of Indian meal had just completed unloading at another port , a grains source said . 
one vessel , most probably containing meal , had reportedly suffered about a month worth of demurrage , arriving in January and unloading only last week , a source said . 
no further details were available and the report could not be confirmed . 
but more meal and beans were expected to arrive . 
&quot; I understand there are a lot of vessels still on the way , &quot; another Hong Kong-based grains trader said . 
traders have estimated about 500,000-600,000 tonnes of meal and beans to arrive between February and March . 
Brazilian soybean meal ex-warehouse in China was heard at 2,560 yuan per tonne . 
domestic meal remained at 2,600 to 2,700 yuan per tonne , while soybeans stayed at about 3,100 yuan per tonne , traders said . 
one Beijing-based trader worried the death of Deng could spark a power struggle between the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation ( MOFTEC ) over the allocation of corn export licences . 
latest indications for beans and meal on a U.S. dollar per tonne , C &amp; F China basis for early March delivery were as follows :
