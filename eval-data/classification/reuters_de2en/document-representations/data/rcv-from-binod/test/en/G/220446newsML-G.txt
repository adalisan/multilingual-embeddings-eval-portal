a gunman killed six people in a shooting spree in northern Spain on Wednesday that ended when he committed suicide with a shot to the chest , region officials said . 
they said it appeared to be a crime of passion . 
Juan Medina , 53 , apparently started the rampage at around 4 p.m. ( 1500 GMT ) when he used a shotgun to murder three of his neighbours in the town of Burgos : two sisters and their brother . 
about an hour later , he travelled 25 km ( 16 miles ) east to San Millan de Lara where he shot and killed his mother-in-law , and the mother of the three earlier victims . 
he then fired at his sister-in-law , seriously wounding her . 
police found him in his bed two hours later with a fatal gunshot wound to the chest in an apparent suicide . 
last April , Medina was taken to court for having threatened to kill one of the victims , Maria del Carmen Delgado , 22 , with whom he claimed to have a romantic relationship . 
originally from southern Spain , he lived many years in France and was known as &quot; The Frenchman &quot; . 
he was separated from his wife and had a child .
