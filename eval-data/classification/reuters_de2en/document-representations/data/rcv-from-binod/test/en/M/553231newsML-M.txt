NWE fuel oil markets were becalmed by Europe-wide public holidays on Thursday . 
high sulphur barge prices picked up $ 1 from Tuesday , as Dutch traders returned to work from their Wednesday holiday but only two deals were seen , at $ 81.50 and $ 82 fob Ara . 
around 4,000 tonnes were believed traded in total . 
&quot; The whole industry went to lunch today , &quot; said one trader . 
prices were steady , with paper markets reported thin and mildly weaker . 
traders were weighing reports that Asia &apos;s big gas oil buying spree may be over . 
some suggested a sharp fall in product prices would have an immediate knock-on effect in Europe , a notion others discounted . 
cargo markets were thin , although one player was heard looking to cover a high sulphur short into a utility . 
&quot; We &apos;re in a stand-off on the high sulphur . 
nobody is really chasing firm offers , &quot; purchasers said . 
bids were in the mid $ 70 &apos;s , while there was talk of offers over $ 80 .
