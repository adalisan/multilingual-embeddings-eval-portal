Zimbabwe &apos;s annual inflation fell to a seven-year low of 13.9 percent in November from 20.2 percent in October , surprising many local economic analysts who expected it to ease slightly or remain around 20 percent . 
the Central Statistical Office said on Wednesday year-on-year consumer price inflation for November dipped to 13.9 percent from 20.2 percent in October , its lowest level since 1989 when it ended at 11 percent . 
some economic analysts said the low figure was largely due to a fall in fresh fruit and vegetable prices as well as the difference in food prices in November this year when Zimbabwe reaped a bumper harvest compared to last November when prices were high on imported products on the back of a crippling drought . 
CSO figures showed that fresh fruit and vegetable prices registered the highest fall in the food basket from October to November . 
they dipped 21.4 percent compared to a 5.1 percent slip in the price of bread and cereals . 
&quot; I expected the decrease in inflation but what I didn &apos;t expect was such a sharp fall , &quot; said economic consultant John Robertson . 
&quot; But the decrease is mainly due to the fall in fruit and vegetable prices and there &apos;s been an important change in prices because of the good agricultural season we have had , &quot; he said . 
but other economic analysts , including Anthony Hawkins of the University of Zimbabwe , were sceptical fruit and vegetable prices could have had such an impact on the inflation basket . 
fruits and vegetables have a 4.8 percent weighting on the total inflation basket compared to 8.3 percent for bread and cereals and 7.6 percent for meat . 
&quot; If tomatoes can bring down inflation that much , are we now a tomato republic ? 
&quot; asked Danny Dube , a senior economist with a local commercial bank . 
&quot; It &apos;s a bit of a freak figure . 
I don &apos;t think one can read too much into this figure . 
the fact that the ( central ) Reserve Bank is tightening money supply indicates that the figure is not particularly meaningful , &quot; Hawkins said . 
two weeks ago , the Reserve Bank raised to 20 percent from 17.5 percent the statutory reserves banks are required to keep . 
it said the measure was aimed at controlling money supply growth -- which has remained above the 22 percent per annum target aimed for under economic reforms started in 1991 -- threatening to undermine efforts to bring down inflation . 
money market analysts said they expected interest rates , which had been falling over the past six months , to creep up on the back of the Reserve Bank measure . 
on Monday , one of the country &apos;s biggest commercial banks , Standard Chartered , raised its minimum lending rate to 29 percent from 28.5 percent , citing the hike in statutory reserves . 
other banks were expected to follow suit but Robertson said he would be surprised if they did . 
he forecast interest rates to come down further as a result of the current inflation figure . 
&quot; Increasing the lending rate was the wrong thing to do and I think they ( Standard Chartered Bank ) will reverse that in a few weeks , &quot; he said .
