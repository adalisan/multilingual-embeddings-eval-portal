Top-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain played a focused third round match to advance at the Evert Cup Monday , but third-seeded Anke Huber of Germany failed to move into the quarterfinals on Monday . 
the fourth-ranked Sanchez Vicario , who hasn &apos;t won a tournament since Hamburg last May , looked extremely comfortable taking a 6-1 6-3 match over 38th-ranked Asa Carlsson of Sweden . 
&quot; Today &apos;s match shows that I was more focused and more concentrated and I was in control of the match since the beginning , &quot; Sanchez Vicario said . 
I was serving pretty well and having the control of the points pretty quickly so she was not having so many chances . 
in contrast , the seventh-ranked Huber couldn &apos;t find a winning form , falling 6-4 6-3 to the 13th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France . 
&quot; I didn &apos;t play well already in practice , so my confidence wasn &apos;t that good . 
two of the women &apos;s quarterfinal match-ups were decided Monday . 
Sanchez Vicario will meet 33rd-ranked Sadrine Testud of France in one quarterfinal , while Tauziat takes on sixth-seeded Irina Spirlea of Romania . 
this marks the first WTA Tour stop that Sanchez Vicario is working with eldest brother , Emilio , as her full-time coach . 
Sanchez Vicario only lost three points on the way to winning the first four games of the match . 
Carlsson only held her serve in the fifth game of that first set . 
the Spaniard took advantage of all five service break opportunities presented in the match -- in the first , third and seventh games of the first set and the fourth and sixth games of the second set . 
Carlsson was successful in breaking Sanchez Vicario &apos;s serve the one time she was in position to do so , in the third game of the second set , but it was of little consequence in the match . 
I played some good points , but it was too much up and down . 
the 21st-ranked Tauziat kept Huber at bay with a variety of shot making that kept the German guessing . 
the Frenchwoman served particularly well at the end of the match , scoring four of her six aces in her final two service games . 
I think the serve was a little bit the key of the match . 
Huber led 3-1 in the first set , but fell apart from that point on . 
at 2-2 in the second set , Tauziat won four of the last five games .
