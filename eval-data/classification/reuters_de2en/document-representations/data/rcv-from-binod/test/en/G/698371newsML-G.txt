Christchurch , July 2 - The composition of the starting sides for Saturday &apos;s Bledisloe Cup rugby test between the All Blacks and the Wallabies at Lancaster Park was still clouded by injury problems on Wednesday . 
Canterbury &apos;s Andrew Mehrtens was withdrawn from the All Black training session at the half-way mark yesterday . 
coach John Hart said it was to avoid aggravating his hamstring injury . 
Mehrtens , who missed the two tests against Argentina , limped as the backs practised , and was pulled off by the All Blacks &apos; medical team for the fear of fatigue worsening the damage . 
Aucklander Carlos Spencer took Mehrtens &apos; place at first five-eighth for the remainder of the practice session . 
meanwhile in Brisbane , Wallaby coach Greg Smith kept quiet about who would be in his starting 15 . 
he wouldn &apos;t say when he would name his team though it appeared at training he had made his choice . 
at least one change will be made from the team that beat France in the second test last Saturday . 
act lock David Giffen broke his foot and has been replaced in the squad by Queensland &apos;s Garrick Morgan . 
Smith maintained his expanded squad of 24 to provide expected cover for some injuries , but yesterday &apos;s training session suggested he may effect two further changes to his starting side . 
former Auckland lock / flanker Daniel manu could be fitted into blindside flanker in place of ACT captain Brett Robinson to add beef and power to the pack . 
centre Jason Little was still being touted to play by Smith , though the player gave himself just 30 percent chance of pulling on his boots at Christchurch &apos;s Lancaster Park for the Bledisloe Cup . 
&quot; Not good , &quot; he said of his chances of playing with a serious hip injury after skipping yesterday &apos;s training . 
the talented midfield back will travel with the team to Christchurch today , though Daniel Herbert is strongly tipped to wear the No 13 jersey opposite Frank Bunce on Saturday . 
another player under the cloud since the weekend was openside flanker David Wilson , whose hip and rib injury had mended enough by yesterday to allow him some pack-down time with his forwards . 
&quot; They &apos;re a bit like the All Blacks , &quot; Hart said of the Australians having adequate cover for all positions . 
manu sat out the two tests against France with a shoulder problem but he showed little sign of that yesterday , team manager John McKay said . 
&quot; He is an option at this stage , we were just looking at combinations , &quot; McKay said . 
manu , with New Zealand experience , has always performed strongly against New Zealand teams and that hasn &apos;t escaped Smith &apos;s attention . 
he was the best Wallaby forward despite their 43-6 defeat in last year &apos;s corresponding match at Athletic Park . 
Mehrtens , forced out of the two tests against Argentina by the hamstring that cut short his test against Fiji three weeks ago , said he felt a slight twinge at training yesterday . 
&quot; They ( All Blacks medical team ) thought I shouldn &apos;t force it too much right now , I &apos;ve still got a couple of days , &quot; he said . 
hart had said he would not risk injuries as the season was long and hard . 
&quot; I &apos;m not overly confident , &quot; he replied when asked if Mehrtens would have recovered fully by Saturday . 
&quot; I think we have to be realistic that he might not come right . 
I have to wait and get the view of the medical staff as to what is the most appropriate thing to do . 
&quot; But Carlos has been told quite clearly right from last Sunday that there was a possibility the injury might not come right . 
he &apos;s in test mode anyway . 
hart said his major concern was the Wallabies ideal buildup for the match in their two tests against France whereas his team were untested by Argentina and Fiji . 
&quot; The Australians will be at a different level than we &apos;ve been in this year , so that &apos;s a bit of a risk for us . 
we thought Argentina were a lot better than they were .
