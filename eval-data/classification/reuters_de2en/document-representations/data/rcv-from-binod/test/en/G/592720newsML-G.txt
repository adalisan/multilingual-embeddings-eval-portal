world champion Michael Doohan held off team mate Alex Criville in final qualifying on Saturday to take his first pole position of the season at the Italian 500cc motorcycling Grand Prix . 
Doohan , also the fastest on Friday , clocked one minute 53.387 seconds on his 22nd lap of the hour-long session at the Mugello track north of Florence , one of the Australian &apos;s favourite venues after four straight wins here . 
Criville , who won the last round of the world championship in his native Spain to close to five points behind leader Doohan in the standings after three races , clocked 1 : 53.789 with his 27th and last lap of the day . 
despite the pole , the 39th of his career and setting him up nicely to equal the late Mike Hailwood &apos;s tally of 37 career 500cc wins in Sunday &apos;s race , Doohan was not delighted and voiced concerns about the lack of grip on the circuit . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t seem like it was last year . 
some people are complaining about the bumps but I think the lack of grip is more of a worry , &quot; the three-times world champion said . 
I &apos;ve followed other guys out there and noticed that their bikes are behaving the same as mine . 
I wouldn &apos;t say its the best set-up but its okay ... okay but not fantastic and that &apos;s kind of how the weekend &apos;s been . 
Doohan had wanted to try out the suspension he used in winning last year but his team had not brought it to Italy . 
that also left the Australian feeling less than happy . 
both Honda riders were inside the official lap record of 1 : 53.829 set by Doohan during the 1993 Grand Prix but outside Doohan &apos;s 1996 circuit best of 1 : 53.260 . 
Japan &apos;s Tadayuki Okada completed a 1-2-3 for Honda in 1 : 53.968 with the third fastest qualifying time that was nonetheless a disappointment for the rider . 
Okada has been on pole at every race so far this season and had been hunting his fourth in a row . 
the fastest three at Mugello had been on the front row of the grid at every Grand Prix of the season but they were joined by a newcomer in fourth-fastest Doriano Romboni . 
the close-cropped Italian , dubbed &quot; Rambo &quot; by his fans , continued a remarkable comeback on the Aprilia 460-twin after breaking his right wrist halfway through last season . 
at Jerez in the Spanish Grand Prix earlier this month , his first race since his long layoff , Romboni climbed from 10th place on the grid to an impressive sixth at the finish for Aprilia &apos;s best 500cc result to date . 
Romboni , riding with a bandage on his wrist on Saturday , said his form had surprised even himself . 
times were considerably faster than during Friday &apos;s qualifying session , with the top 10 all improving on a hot and bright afternoon after showers the previous day . 
they included France &apos;s Jean-Michel Bayle , the 10th fastest on the Kenny Roberts team &apos;s new Modenas KR V3 and ahead of both the Suzukis on a bad day for the factory team .
