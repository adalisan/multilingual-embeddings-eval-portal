Northern Ireland &apos;s main Protestant leader accused the British and Irish governments on Monday of trying to get their arch foes , Sinn Fein , into multi-party talks by the back door . 
David Trimble , leader of the Ulster Unionist Party , told a news conference that the two governments were trying to ease the terms under which Sinn Fein , political wing of the IRA guerrilla movement , could take part in the four-month-old negotiations . 
the talks , which resumed on Monday in Belfast , were dealt a further blow when jailed &quot; Loyalist &quot; Protestant guerrillas announced that they had lost faith with the province &apos;s struggling two-year peace efforts . 
the statement by Loyalist prisoners hinted at a possible breakdown of a ceasefire by the Loyalist movement , which is battling to keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom . 
the background to the talks was further muddied by the discovery last week of a suspected IRA ( Irish Republican Army ) bomb factory in London and a failed bid by a splinter Irish republican group to plant a car bomb overnight in Belfast . 
four men appeared in court in London on Monday charged with plotting bomb attacks following police raids last week in which one suspect was shot dead . 
they were arrested after police discovered 10 tonnes of explosives in raids on houses in London . 
the four were remanded in custody until October 9 . 
in Belfast , police destroyed a car in a controlled explosion and said later it had contained homemade explosives and bomb components . 
a warning was telephoned to a newspaper by a man claiming to represent the &quot; Irish continuity Army &quot; , a maverick republican group . 
Trimble , who leads the largest Protestant majority party , said the British and Irish governments were engaging in behind the scenes manoeuvres to ease conditions for Sinn Fein &apos;s entry into the talks in the event of an IRA truce . 
Sinn Fein is currently barred because the IRA ditched a 17- month truce in February and launched bomb attacks in mainland Britain and one at a British army base in Germany . 
he said the governments were softening their demand that the IRA disarm in stages as the talks progress , instead of at the opening of negotiations as Protestants want . 
&quot; Way back in February ( British Prime Minister ) John Major said that the talks would go forward with Sinn Fein or without them . 
now is he in fact prepared to do that , or is he still carrying a torch for Sinn Fein ? 
&quot; Trimble said . 
&quot; If the two governments are not prepared to deal with the ( decommissioning ) issue seriously at this stage , then they are putting the talks at risk , &quot; he said . 
the IRA has resolutely refused to hand over any of its huge stockpiles of guns and explosives in advance of a political settlement in Northern Ireland . 
the resumption of the guerrillas &apos; bombing campaign in February created fissures in the ranks of Loyalist gunmen but their two-year truce has held . 
support for the ceasefire from Loyalist activists in prison was a key factor in the Loyalists &apos; decision to call a truce and has been seen as crucial to its maintenance . 
but jailed members of the banned Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association announced after a meeting with Loyalist politicians on Monday that they were withdrawing support from the peace process .
