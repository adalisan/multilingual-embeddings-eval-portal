a superb solo effort by Ibrahima Ba crowned an impressive 2-0 win for 1998 World Cup hosts France over Portugal in a friendly international on Wednesday . 
the Bordeaux midfielder , who was a thorn in the Portuguese side all night , wrong-footed Barcelona central defender Fernando Couto on the left before cutting into the area and pushing the ball wide of Victor Baia in the Portuguese goal . 
the goal summed up the easy superiority which the French , showing no ill effects from not having played together for three months , displayed against a disappointing Portuguese team who were given few opportunities to shine . 
Didier Deschamps had put France ahead after just 10 minutes , taking advantage of a howling error by the Portuguese defence . 
&quot; We have to congratulate France . 
they are a strong side and they deserved to win , &quot; said Portuguese coach Artur Jorge , whose side was booed from the pitch by the 40,000-strong crowd in this northern city . 
&quot; We gave away that first goal . 
it just was not our night . 
although French coach Aime Jacquet was generous in victory , saying that Portugal had deserved a goal , the home team in fact had few chances to score . 
the French midfield gave the Portuguese little time or room in which to build attacks and the defence , marshalled by Laurent Blanc and Marcel Desailly , was rock-solid . 
Deschamps was handed his goal by AC Milan striker Christophe Dugarry who slipped him the ball instead of shooting when put through in the area . 
the Juventus midfielder was left to stroke the ball into an empty net . 
Portugal sought to rally towards the end of the first half when a fine shot by Domingos Oliveira , which flew narrowly over the bar , seemed to jar them into life . 
but it was still the French that had the best chance , with Deschamps taking careful aim but sending a looping shot just wide of the upright almost on the stroke of halftime . 
such was the French confidence that Jacquet substituted both Ba and Deschamps immediately after the second goal to bring on Inter Milan &apos;s Youri Djorkaeff and Bruno N &apos;Gotty . 
Portugal &apos;s best chance came in the closing minutes when Oliveira , returning to the national side after a four-month lay-off for injury , shot wide after one of the few French defensive errors had left him unmarked in front of goal .
