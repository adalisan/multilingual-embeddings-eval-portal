China , eager to win free trade kudos and speed its entry into the World Trade Organisation , on Monday vowed to cut tariffs to an average 15 percent by 2000 -- but diplomats said the promise signalled little policy change . 
Beijing had made great efforts to promote the liberalisation of international trade and investment and planned to continue cutting import duties , the official Xinhua news agency quoted Chinese President Jiang Zemin as saying . 
&quot; China will bring it ( the average tariff ) further down to around 15 percent by the year 2000 , &quot; Jiang said in an address to regional leaders at the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum at Subic Bay in the Philippines . 
in the same speech , Jiang said it would be very difficult to liberalise trade in information technology according to a fixed timetable , suggesting Chinese reservations over a U.S.-led push for a global pact on free trade in such technology by 2000 . 
Jiang &apos;s speech came just a year after he stole the show at an APEC meeting in Japan with high-profile promises of tariff cuts , but Beijing-based diplomats said the Chinese president &apos;s latest vow was unlikely to repeat earlier success . 
&quot; This isn &apos;t of the same order , &quot; said a diplomat from an APEC member nation , adding that although the 2000 deadline for duty cuts appeared new , the target itself was already familiar . 
China was eager to speed progress toward its long-cherished goal of membership in the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , but the 15 percent tariff target alone would add little impetus to Beijing &apos;s campaign , the diplomat said . 
&quot; The 15 percent is nothing new , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They have said for some time that &apos;s the target they are working to . 
while the atmosphere at WTO negotiations had improved in recent months , the diplomats said much still needed to be done to hammer out the details of China &apos;s entry , which Beijing argues should be on the favourable terms accorded developing nations . 
the United States and other WTO members argue that China &apos;s fast-expanding financial muscle means it should accept more exacting entry requirements , prompting Chinese accusations that Western forces are trying to stifle its economic growth . 
any cut in China &apos;s tariffs was a move in the right direction , but there was still a long way to go to WTO membership , a European diplomat said . 
&quot; From our perspective , 15 percent is not enough , &quot; he said . 
&quot; China is well aware that they haven &apos;t done the deal with this announcement . 
at last year &apos;s APEC meeting in the Japanese city of Osaka , Jiang upstaged fellow Asia-Pacific leaders by announcing plans to cut the tariffs guarding China &apos;s market by nearly one third . 
the APEC announcement was backed up in April when Beijing slashed tariffs to an average 23 percent , a move welcomed by Chinese exporters but opposed by struggling state companies wary of increased foreign competition . 
Chinese Premier Li Peng later said China would take vigorous steps to lower tariffs to 15 percent , a level he described as average for developing nations , but gave no timetable . 
in a joint statement at the Subic Bay APEC meeting on Monday , APEC leaders called for an agreement by the WTO to substantially eliminate tariffs on information technology by 2000 , but Jiang &apos;s speech suggested Chinese reservations . 
flexibility would be needed on the kind of products to be included in any liberalisation and efforts would be needed to eliminate barriers to technology transfer , Jiang said . 
&quot; However , because of the differences in the levels of economic development in the member economies , it is very difficult for the liberalisation in this field to be pushed forward in accordance with a timetable , &quot; he said .
