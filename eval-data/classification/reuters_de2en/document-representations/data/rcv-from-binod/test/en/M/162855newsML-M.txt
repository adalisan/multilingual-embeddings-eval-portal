last week , a string of key economic reports kept many index options participants on the sidelines and this week , Tuesday &apos;s presidential elections are doing the same , traders said Monday . 
what trading was seen Monday maintained the recent pattern , with put volume outpacing call volume . 
analysts said they doubted the market would make a big move in the runup to the election , with most indicators showing a mixed market . 
&quot; A lot of people are getting caught up on the day &apos;s news , &quot; one trader said after spending some time on the floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) . 
&quot; Nothing &apos;s going on . 
traders said activity Tuesday is likely to be sluggish also , with election results not likely until well after the market closes . 
Schaeffer said out of the money put open interest in the OEX continues to outpace out of the money call open interest , providing one indication of investor nervousness . 
another such signal is the recent pattern in the CBOE &apos;s volatility index , he said . 
last Friday , the VIX dipped only slightly despite the passing of the key October employment report . 
in past months , the VIX has fallen sharply after the jobs report . 
the VIX , down 0.65 at 18.78 Monday afternoon , is also suggesting investor &apos;s caution remains high , Schaeffer said . 
&quot; From this perspective , a sharp rally in th eVIX between now and Tuesday &apos;s close , particularly if the market holds its own , could be a good indicator of speculator nervousness going into the election , &quot; Schaeffer said in the report . 
that &quot; would imply that the market will tend to react favorably to just about any result short of a Democratic sweep , &quot; he said .
