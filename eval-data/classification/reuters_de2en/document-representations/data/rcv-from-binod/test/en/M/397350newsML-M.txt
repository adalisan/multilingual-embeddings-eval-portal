three-month copper was bid slightly lower than the kerb close in Monday &apos;s evening session but prices still represented a rise on the day . 
LME copper was indicated at $ 2,372 a tonne at 1915 GMT after a kerb level of $ 2,373 a tonne which was up $ 7 on the day . 
it had carved out a peak since June 1996 of $ 2,385 earlier in the day . 
but some traders were sceptical about copper &apos;s upside prospects . 
&quot; There is still much uncertainty over what the Chinese are doing with regards restocking and as so much depends on this , the market remains vulnerable , &quot; said Rudolf Wolff in a daily metals report . 
nickel -- the day &apos;s biggest winner -- extended its gains by another $ 5 in the evening session to $ 8,090 a tonne , on top of the $ 210 rise it recorded during the kerb . 
aluminium was indicated at the kerb level of $ 1,654 , representing an impressive $ 23 bounce in the day . 
Rudolf Wolff said having cleared $ 1,651 , the next targets for aluminium were $ 1,680 and $ 1,691 .
