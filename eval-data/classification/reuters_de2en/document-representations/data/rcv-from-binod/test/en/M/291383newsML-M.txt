Indian call money ended Tuesday steady in the 4.50-5.0 percent range in moderate , range-bound trade , dealers said . 
they said good liquidity with banks after a cut in banks &apos; cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) requirements led to poor demand for funds and kept rates in a narrow band . 
the Reserve Bank of India cut banks &apos; CRR to 10.5 percent , effective January 4 , from 11 percent , releasing about 21 billion rupees to banks . 
dealers said prices of government securities fell in moderate trade as market participants unwound positions anticipating a fresh round of government borrowings . 
&quot; There are rumours that the government is going to hit the market for funds shortly , &quot; said a dealer at a state-run bank . 
&quot; Market players fear that interest rates are headed south , given the current liquidity in the system . 
in a falling interest rate scenario , current holdings of securities would suffer depreciation in market value , he said . 
&quot; Fear of having to provide for depreciation is keeping buyers off the market , &quot; the dealer said . 
&quot; Once this uncertainty is removed , we may see buyers returning to the market . 
the 13.40 percent 1999 government of India stock was traded on Tuesday at 100.90 rupees against a last traded price of 101.17 and the 13.50 percent 1998 at 102.90 against 103.00 , dealers said . 
the 13.55 percent 2001 shed 37 paise to 100.78 rupees . 
the 364-day treasury bill maturing on January 2 , 1998 was traded at a yield of 10.35 percent against last traded 10.25 percent , they said . 
dealers said there were no trades in commercial paper or certificates of deposit . 
&quot; Highly-rated companies are looking to place three-month commercial paper in the primary market between 11.75 percent and 12.25 percent , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; But investors are looking at returns of 13 percent and above .
