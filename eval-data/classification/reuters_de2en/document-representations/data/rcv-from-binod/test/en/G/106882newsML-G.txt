leading Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has been ordered to serve three years in a labour camp , just hours after police detained him in an early morning raid on his Beijing home , his wife said on Wednesday . 
police had notified her early on Wednesday of the administrative sentence , which does not need a court trial , but gave her no reason for the punishment . 
he did not do anything illegal , &quot; said Liu Xia in a telephone interview . 
&quot; All he did was exercise his freedom of speech . 
she said she had not decided whether to appeal against the sentence which was passed just hours after Liu was detained and taken from his Beijing home by a group of uniformed and plainclothes police early on Tuesday . 
Liu might be sent to a labour camp near his northeast hometown of Dalian , his wife said . 
police had searched the couple &apos;s home and confiscated books , photographs , documents and articles that Liu had written , she said . 
police gave no reason for the detention of Liu , a renowned literary critic who gained fame as a dissident during the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement that was crushed by the military with heavy loss of life . 
Liu has been active in recent months , sending open letters to the government to demand press freedom and talks with the Dalai Lama on Tibet . 
on September 30 , Liu and veteran pro-democracy activist Wang Xizhe issued a statement urging China &apos;s communist authorities to honour a promise in 1945 to give people religious freedom , freedom of the press and speech and to form political parties and stage demonstrations . 
in a bold move , the two demanded Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin be indicted , impeached and step down for violating the constitution for saying the People &apos;s Liberation Army was under the &quot; absolute leadership &quot; of the party instead of the state . 
Wang Xizhe was still at liberty in southern Guangzhou on Tuesday . 
Liu was last detained by police in 1995 after orchestrating several daring petitions to parliament by groups of dissidents and intellectuals in the early months of the year . 
he was held for more than seven months without formal charges until being released last January .
