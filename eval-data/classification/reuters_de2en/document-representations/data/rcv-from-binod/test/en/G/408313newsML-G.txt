the ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra said on Thursday Baghdad was prepared to open a dialogue with the United States . 
&quot; Iraq realises quite well that the United States is a superpower with vital interests in the region . 
Iraq does not want to threaten these interests , &quot; declared Thawra in a front- page editorial . 
&quot; Iraq has no interest in fighting the United States or being hostile to it . 
it has more than one advantage in dealing with it , &quot; the paper added . 
the paper said isolating or containing Iraq would not serve U.S. interests in the region . 
Washington leads a tough anti-Iraq camp at the U.N. Security Council . 
Iraq &apos;s President Saddam Hussein in remarks published on Wednesday called the United States the worst despot history had ever known . 
Thawra warned that Washington &apos;s &quot; blind enmity &quot; towards the government in Baghdad would eventually destroy its interests in the region . 
&quot; If Iraq is not allowed to have a normal international way of life , enjoying security and stability , the region &apos;s security will remain under threat , without stability , &quot; Thawra said . 
Thawra urged Washington to give up attempts to topple the Iraqi government . 
it said the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait and the U.N. trade embargo had failed to change the regime . 
&quot; The current ( U.S. ) administration , like its predecessor , has drastically failed in achieving its aims in the forefront of them the removal of the ruling regime in Iraq , &quot; it said . 
Thawra said a dialogue with Iraq and the lifting of sanctions were the prerequisites for peace and stability in the area .
