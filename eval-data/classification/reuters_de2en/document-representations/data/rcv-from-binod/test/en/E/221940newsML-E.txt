Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel said in an interview published on Wednesday he was predicating monetary policy for 1997 on an inflation target of 8-10 percent , the same as 1996 . 
&quot; The last target established by the previous government was for inflation of 8-10 percent . 
as long as this target is not updated , the Bank of Israel &apos;s working assumption is that this is the target that the government has authorised , &quot; Frenkel said in an interview with the newspaper Haaretz . 
in the past the Treasury in coordination with the central bank had set an inflation target several months before the end of the year . 
last year the previous finance minister , Avraham Shohat unilaterally set the target at 8-10 percent , but Finance Minister Dan Meridor has yet to determine a figure . 
the Bank of Israel has urged the Treasury to set more ambitious targets of 7-10 percent in 1997 , falling gradually to 4-7 percent in the year 2000 . 
although the rate has fallen sharply in the second half of the year , inflation in 1996 is expected to reach 11 percent , up from 8.1 percent in 1995 . 
&quot; It is desirable that the government adapt as early as possible a strategy that sets multi-year targets for inflation in parallel with establishing targets for reducing the budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product through the year 2001 , &quot; Frenkel said . 
Frenkel said a multi-year target was important because the impact of monetary policy on the overall economy took as much as 6-9 months .
