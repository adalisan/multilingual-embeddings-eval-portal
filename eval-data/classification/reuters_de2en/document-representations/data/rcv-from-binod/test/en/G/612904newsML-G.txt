a new elite is preparing to take the reins in Hong Kong , prompting fears of a rise in business conflict-of-interest and even corruption among the influential and powerful . 
from the outside , little appears to have changed . 
Hong Kong &apos;s future leader Tung Chee-hwa has followed the British system to the letter , appointing a small group of people to sit on his Executive Council , an inner cabinet positioned between the soon-to-be chief executive , and the legislature . 
the shift has come in the nature of the appointments . 
polarised from the departing British government by years of Sino-British wrangling , Tung was forced to turn to the people he knew best for advice on how to run Hong Kong -- businessmen . 
&quot; What we see is a gradual erosion of the distinct separation between the government and the business community , &quot; said Joseph Cheng , politics professor at City University of Hong Kong . 
those appointed to the Executive Council have always held great influence in this prosperous territory of 6.4 million people , which only recently tasted democracy for the first time . 
their influence will be that much greater after the handover to China on July 1 , when the Beijing-appointed Provisional Legislature replaces the existing , elected chamber . 
the Provisional Legislature , also studded with prominent businessmen , is viewed as little more than a rubber-stamp . 
the new arrangments will inevitably place much more influence in the hands of the small band of wealthy technocrats who dominate Tung &apos;s new inner cabinet . 
it was not unusual for big business to wield influence in the Executive Council under the British colonial system , but greater representation from other walks of life was more usual . 
so was an appreciation for the potential pitfalls , real or imagined , of conflict of interest and corruption , rated the number one handover-related concern among Hong Kong people . 
none of the existing inner cabinet members with ties to the police , regulatory authorities or Hong Kong &apos;s highly effective Independent Commission Against Corruption was asked to remain . 
&quot; This incoming adminstration does not appreciate the significance of a clear separation between politics and business , &quot; Cheng said . 
his views were supported by an observer at the first formal meeting between Tung soon after his appointment as chief executive and David Akers-Jones , former civil service head . 
intended as a cordial get-together , the session turned into an off-the-record lecture with Tung taking notes as Akers-Jones explained the importance of arm &apos;s-length management of personal business affairs by those holding public office . 
Tung , who has placed his own extensive business assets in trust , sparked an outcry when he asked Leung Chun-ying , a property surveyor and property consultant , to map out a long-term housing strategy for the territory . 
&quot; People are very sensitive to the fact that he has been in the housing business for so long and now he is in charge of housing policy , &quot; Cheng said . 
&quot; We are concerned there is a blurring of the line between politics and business . 
the government in Hong Kong plays a very big role in the property sector , arguably the most important of all domestic economic sectors . 
brokerage SBC Warburg comments that , from 1991 to 1994 , only seven property developers dominated the residential property market supplying about 70 percent of total new private housing . 
shortage of supply has been blamed for rocketing property prices in Hong Kong . 
while the government is responsible for releasing and auctioning land for development , property developers control when and how many units they release . 
&quot; This has implications for developers &apos; profits , the prices paid by the consumer and also the tax take of the government , &quot; SBC Warburg said . 
blurred lines are the order of the day in China , where &quot; guanxi &quot; or having the right connections , dominates the business world and where corruption is endemic . 
many Hong Kong people are concerned the territory will become infected by a Chinese-style of business practice , a risk that political analysts warned would be disastrous for Hong Kong &apos;s continued competitiveness . 
&quot; One of Hong Kong &apos;s most important assets was that its government enjoyed a high degree of legitimacy and trust from its citizens , &quot; said one political analyst , who asked that his name not be used . 
&quot; I am not sure that can be sustained in the future . 
this is a very important issue . 
it may harm the legitimacy of the new government , &quot; he said . 
Michael DeGolyer , political analyst at Baptist University of Hong Kong , said that given the current atmostphere of distrust , any suggestion of impropriety would be disastrous . 
&quot; If there were to be revealed some sort of collusion between mainland interests and people in the inner cabinet , that would be a very explosive mix , one of the worst possible things that could happen , &quot; he said .
