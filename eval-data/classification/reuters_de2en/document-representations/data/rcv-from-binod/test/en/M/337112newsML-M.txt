coffee looked fit to resume its uptrend on Tuesday as benchmark prices recouped most losses , but traders stressed further correction was needed for a healthy rise . 
&quot; It &apos;s mystifying . 
I was expecting the market down but trade seems to be bullish of it , &quot; said one trader . 
new York values were supported by trade buying which widened the arbitrage . 
London initially came under producer selling , mainly by Far Eastern origins , but recovered at the close with trade and some roaster interest . 
prices have sloped downwards this week following a steep rally last week triggered by concerns over near-term supplies carried contracts to severely overbought chart territory . 
at the close , benchmark March coffee was flat at $ 1,475 a tonne . 
January gained $ 26 but traders said with two days to go before expiry the spot contract was subject to aggressive short covering . 
turnover reached 4,995 lots . 
CSCE arabica contracts bounced higher on Tuesday with March trading 1.80 cents higher at 138.40 cents a lb London &apos;s close . 
it reached a high of 140.20 . 
technically robusta may need to do further sideways trading before it breaks through resistance seen above $ 1,600 at the high last week of $ 1,630 .
