spreads between AAA and Baa-rated municipals continued to narrow last week , figures from Delphis Hanover Corp show . 
from June 6 to the June 13 , spreads on 30-year BAA paper improved by 20 basis points , while spreads on comparable AAA paper improved by just 10 basis points . 
the disparity was even more apparent from 2004 through 2009 , where non-rated paper improved by 25 basis points versus 10 basis points of improvement in comparable AAA paper . 
Delphis Hanover president Austin Tobin said when 30-year , AAA muni yields dip below 80 percent of U.S. Treasury bond yields , and remain there for a week or so , a correction has traditionally followed . 
the ratio stood at 79.5 percent Friday , just above the new 52-week low of 79.0 set June 10 . 
in addition , a scenario where lesser bonds continue to improve while AAA bonds remain constant , has signaled potential trouble in the past , he said . 
&quot; A good risk commitment manager ... in a situation like this would be telling his traders &apos; Let &apos;s lighten up fellas , lighten up quite a bit in here , and see what happens next , &apos; &quot; Tobin said . 
a municipal trader said one reason lesser quality bonds have shown more improvement than high-grade issues is because buyers are hunting for yield . 
&quot; You &apos;ve got mutual funds who have a lot of bonds getting called , but they have no new cash , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; And they have bonds that they bought 10 years ago when yields were 7.0 or 8.0 percent , and they need to replace with the highest yielding thing possible because their dividend will get cut otherwise . 
while portfolio managers know it doesn &apos;t make sense to buy an AMT housing bond at 50 basis points off high-grades when they used to buy it at 80 basis points off , they do it anyway in pursuit of yield , he said . 
&quot; You know it &apos;s going to get you in the end , but it &apos;s going to lessen the blow on your dividend , &quot; he said .
