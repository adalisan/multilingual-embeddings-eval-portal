Greek depos and forex forwards were sitting tight , holding morning levels and bonds were trading around intra-day lows in late calm trade , dealers said . 
the drachma continued to gain ground against the soft mark but retreated against the robust dollar and was stable vis-a-vis the ecu , traders said . 
&quot; Depos and forex forwards are little changed and volume is thin , &quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank . 
&quot; It is surprising to me that short-term rates including spotnext trade low , around 10 percent , with an bond auction in sight . 
bonds were steady after being battered in early trade with yields stabilising around intra-day highs , dealers said . 
&quot; Bonds are hovering around intra-day lows , &quot; said a senior bond dealer at a private bank . 
other dealers said the drop in bond prices should be expected with a number of banks raising money for the bond auction on July 15 and the central bank &apos;s fixed rate depo tender for 14-day funds on Wednesday . 
&quot; It is not a secret that a number of players seek to raise money for the bond auction and the central bank &apos;s 11.90 percent depo tender of 14-day funds on Wednesday , &quot; said a bond dealer at a foreign bank . 
&quot; Foreign demand for bonds is weak and somebody has to fill the gap . 
the yield on the 10-year coupon bond was little changed around 9.40 percent . 
Greece will seek bids for a further 75 billion drachmas each of five- and seven-year bonds with coupons of 9.2 percent and 8.9 percent respectively , and 120 billion drachmas of 8.8 percent , 10-year bonds on July 15 , the finance ministry announced late on Thursday . 
the five- and seven-year bonds were auctioned for the first time ever on March 19 and then bids were re-opened on June 17 . 
the 10-year bonds were auctioned for the first time ever on June 17 . 
Greece will also auction 150 billion drachmas of seven-year floating rate notes on July 29 . 
the mark was quoted at 156.75 / 80 from Monday &apos;s 156.780 fix , the dollar at 280.83 / 93 drachmas from 281.270 and the ecu at 309.53 / 63 from 309.52 drachmas . 
&quot; Ecu / drachma has been fluctuating in the tight 309.45 / 70 range all day and volume has been thin , &quot; said a forex dealer at a foreign bank . 
&quot; The drachma gained against the mark in line with the latter &apos;s weakness against EMS currencies breaking the 157 level on the downside . 
the dollar continued to show strength against the drachma , piercing the 280 resistance , dealers said . 
&quot; Movements in dollar / drachma reflect the U.S. currency &apos;s strength against the mark and other currencies in world markets , &quot; said a forex dealer .
