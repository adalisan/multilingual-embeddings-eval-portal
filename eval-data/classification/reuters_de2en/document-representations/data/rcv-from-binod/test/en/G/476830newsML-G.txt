Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo said on Monday they unanimously decided to suspend normal ties with Israel because of what Syrian minister Farouq al-Shara called the Jewish state &apos;s &quot; clumsy and stupid &quot; anti-peace policy . 
the ministers agreed on Sunday night to recommend that their countries suspend normal ties with the Jewish state , restore the economic boycott , close down Israeli missions and withdraw from multilateral peace talks . 
they met again on Monday . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Arab states of ganging up on Israel but called the notion that they could revive the Arab boycott &quot; absurd &quot; . 
Shara told reporters at the end of the ministers morning session : &quot; This resolution has been issued unanimously . 
all the ministers who spoke , including Morocco and Oman , said they support the essence of the resolution . 
&quot; The resolution is very wise because it is aimed at saving the peace process and affirms the commitment of Arabs to peace . 
it says that peace cannot be achieved unless occupied Arab land is returned . 
peace for peace cannot be implemented . 
&quot; Netanyahu &apos;s policies have forced Arab countries to take such a decision , &quot; Shara said . 
&quot; Arabs have taken a wise decision in response to a clumsy and stupid policy . 
the Arab League has not yet released the final text of the resolutions but , as described by some of the ministers , they are the most decisive concerted action the Arabs have taken since Netanyahu took power last June . 
the effect will be somewhat diluted because states which have formal agreements with Israel -- Egypt , Jordan and the Palestinians -- are not required to enforce the resolutions . 
Arab anger came to a head when Israeli bulldozers broke ground at a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem on March 18 . 
Palestinians throwing stones have clashed with Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza since then and talks between Israel and the Palestinians are close to collapse . 
Netanyahu said on Monday Arabs should not revert to threats whenever their relations with Israel were strained . 
&quot; What is required on the Arab side is to recognise that we are not always going to have agreement with Israel but that we don &apos;t go back to this mode of &apos; ganging up &apos; on Israel and making these absurd ideas that the boycott will be reinstated , &quot; Netanyahu told Israel Radio &apos;s English news . 
&quot; Israel has known periods of Israel-bashing more than once and we &apos;ve been able to overcome it , &quot; he said . 
Farouk Kaddoumi , the hardline head of the PLO &apos;s political ( foreign affairs ) department , said the Israeli premier was trying to wipe out Palestinians . 
&quot; Netanyahu should go to hell . 
he is a hardliner . 
he thinks we ( Palestinians ) are Red Indians . 
he comes from Brooklyn , from the United States . 
he thinks he can annihilate the Palestinians . 
Netanyahu is like Hitler . 
the decision to halt steps towards normalisation with Israel was hailed as a victory by Syria and Lebanon , which have long urged other Arab states such as Oman , Qatar , Morocco and Tunisia not to rush towards setting up ties with the Jewish state . 
&quot; From the beginning of the peace process we asked of our brotherly Arab countries not to rush into taking decisions that would precede the normal development of the peace process , &quot; Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez said . 
&quot; We must choose -- either the peace process as agreed upon in Madrid and Israel must express a clear intention that it will abide by stopping its settlement policy and abide by the principle of land for peace , or that Israel does not want this process . 
in this case Arab countries cannot be committed to something Israel has destroyed , &quot; he added . 
Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah , whose country froze relations with Israel last week , blamed Israel for the Arab resolution . 
&quot; The prime minister of Israel has closed the door to normalisation . 
everyone is keen on keeping the track of peace going on . 
it is for the Israeli government to decide whether they want normalisation with Arabs or not , &quot; Alawi said . 
&quot; If they want normalisation with other Arabs they should normalise relations with Palestinians as well , &quot; he said .
