world oil prices marched higher again on Friday , partly recapturing mid-week losses in an advance towards six-year highs set on Monday . 
London December futures for international benchmark Brent crude last traded 34 cents up at $ 24.53 a barrel . 
the rebound was triggered on Thursday by the release of weekly U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) data confirming a tight picture on heating oil markets as winter approaches in the northern hemisphere . 
&quot; The market is running on empty so it &apos;s bound to react cautiously to any news ... Nobody wants to go short before the weekend and then live to regret it , &quot; said one floor broker at London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange . 
U.S. heating oil stocks were down 27 percent against the same time last year with key East Coast inventories off a huge 43 percent , the DOE said . 
the market appeared calm ahead of today &apos;s meeting between U.S. oil company executives , Energy Secretary Hazel O &apos;Leary and a Justice Department representative to discuss the impact of low stocks on U.S. consumers . 
heading into the meeting , O &apos;Leary told reporters she would ask the executives whether they had extra capacity in their refineries to produce additional heating oil . 
she said she was concerned that the low stock situation might not just be an unusual occurrence and might become common . 
she also wanted the executives to explain how long they expected Europe to be an attractive market for U.S. heating oil exports . 
speculation among traders that oil companies may volunteer to curb heating oil exports had initially spooked the market , pushing prices down on Wednesday . 
but some had a different view by the end of the week . 
&quot; It &apos;s unlikely that oil companies will voluntarily agree to strict export restrictions , &quot; said Christopher Bellew of London futures brokers Prudential-Bache . 
&quot; They have to be seen to be maximising profits for their shareholders . 
Market-watchers said a clampdown on exports wasn &apos;t the only solution to problems of low stocks . 
suspension of the U.S. regulations requiring oil companies to use U.S. flag-carrying tankers for shipment of oil from one U.S. port to another would also help stem the haemorrhage of heating oil to Europe in cheaper foreign-flagged vessels , traders said . 
while such a move would be more popular with oil companies , it is unlikely to win the votes of the U.S. public in the runup to elections , analysts said . 
meanwhile , concerns over political instability in Russia following the sacking of security chief Alexander Lebed and renewed fighting in northern Iraq were also helping to underpin oil prices . 
the bitter Kurdish conflict in Iraq was seen hotting up on Friday before U.S.-backed talks began , as fighters of the Baghdad-backed Kurdish Democratic Party ( KDP ) overwhelmed a rival Kurdish militia group and seized the strategic northern town of Koy Sanjak . 
the fighting precedes a meeting planned for next week between KDP leader Massoud Barzani and Robert Pelletreau , U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs , for talks on ending the conflict .
