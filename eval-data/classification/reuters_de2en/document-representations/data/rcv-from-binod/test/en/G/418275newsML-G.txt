EU Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti said on Tuesday he hoped for legally binding commitments from member states on completing the single market . 
the Commission , eager to boost growth and employment , is preparing an action plan which will be presented to the European Council in Amsterdam on June 16-17 . 
the plan is aimed at completing the single market by 1999 , when monetary union is due to start . 
Monti , in a speech at the Centre for European Policy Studies , said he did not want leaders to adopt another declaration of principle about the importance of the single market , which was launched on January 1 , 1993 . 
&quot; I want that to be coupled with politically and hopefully legally binding commitments undertaken by member states at Amsterdam , &quot; he said . 
the action plan would attack remaining single market obstacles , eliminate unnecessary rules , remove tax barriers and create more room for competition . 
Monti said the single market had boosted growth , lowered inflation and increased employment but member states needed to implement and enforce all legislation aimed at removing internal trade barriers .
