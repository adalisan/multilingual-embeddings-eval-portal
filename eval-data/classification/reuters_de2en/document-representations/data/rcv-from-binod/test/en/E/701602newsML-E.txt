Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said gross domestic product had grown slightly more than one percent in the first half of the year , the first rise since reforms began , Interfax news agency said on Wednesday . 
&quot; This has happened for the first time in five years of reforms , &quot; it quoted him as saying . 
Chernomyrdin , addressing a science awards ceremony in Moscow , did not give a basis for his calculation . 
the State Statistics Committee said last month that gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the widest indicator of economic output , had fallen 0.2 percent in the first five months of the year compared to a year ago . 
may GDP fell 0.4 percent on a year earlier , although it grew 0.8 percent on April &apos;s level . 
many Russian officials have said growth initially expected this year would occur only in 1998 . 
they have generally forecast flat output in 1997 .
