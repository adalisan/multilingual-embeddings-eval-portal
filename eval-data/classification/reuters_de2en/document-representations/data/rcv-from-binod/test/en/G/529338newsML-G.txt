President Bill Clinton on Tuesday departed for North Dakota to inspect flood damage , vowing to &quot; do everything we can &quot; to help the victims of the natural disaster . 
speaking at the White House , Clinton said he was going to the ravaged area &quot; to view the flood damage , to pledge our nation &apos;s support , ( and ) see that we can do everything we can do to help them . 
&quot; People are quite literally in the fight of their lives , &quot; Clinton said before departing the White House . 
&quot; What they have endured is enormous . 
how they are enduring it is remarkable . 
&quot; Americans have a habit of joining together at times like this , &quot; Clinton said , noting the entire nation has been &quot; deeply moved by the pictures &quot; of the devastation , particularly in Grand forks -- a city that has been evacuated . 
about 90 percent of Grank forks , a city of 50,000 , was under water from the bulging Red River , which extended its widening path of destruction northward into Canada . 
in response to a question , Clinton said &quot; we &apos;re going to have to be prepared to be very creative &quot; in coming up with the best way to deal with such a massive problem .
