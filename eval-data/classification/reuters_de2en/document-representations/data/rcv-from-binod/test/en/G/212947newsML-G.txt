Vietnam &apos;s President Le Duc Anh is lying in a coma at the Hanoi 108 Army Hospital after suffering a brain haemorrhage about nine days ago , medical sources said on Sunday . 
&quot; Earlier in the week he &apos;d been getting better , but in the last few days his condition became very serious , &quot; one source said , adding doctors were unwilling to operate on the 75-year-old general or move him as his condition was so bad . 
that was at odds with a government source &apos;s comment on Saturday that Anh , one of the communist country &apos;s leadership troika , had begun to recover . 
that source said said news reports indicating the situation was more serious were exaggerated and rumours that he was more seriously ill or had even died should not be believed . 
there have been widely conflicting reports about Anh &apos;s condition over the past week . 
political sources and medical staff have said that Anh was paralysed down one side of his body by a stroke , while the government &apos;s only official comment has been that he is tired and is in need of some rest . 
there has been no announcement that Anh &apos;s deputy , Nguyen Thi Binh will stand in -- constitutional procedure if the president is incapacitated -- or that any successor is being considered . 
Anh , who holds a key position of influence over the military and security apparatus , is part of leadership triumvirate which includes Communist Party Secretary-General Do Muoi , 79 , and reformist Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet , 73 . 
analysts say Anh &apos;s departure could reopen an internal debate over leadership succession which had simmered ahead of a key Communist Party congress earlier this year .
