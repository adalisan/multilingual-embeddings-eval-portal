Marco Pantani &apos;s victory in the Tour de France on Monday despite illness was due as much to his manager &apos;s insistence as to his own efforts . 
the brilliant Italian mountain rider was on the point of quitting the Tour because of a sore throat . 
he took the Alpe d &apos;Huez stage on Saturday but suffered a three-minute deficit at Courchevel on Sunday . 
but his team manager Giuseppe Martinelli would have none of it , according to the slightly-built rider who is nicknamed &quot; Elefantino &quot; because of his prominent ears . 
&quot; I &apos;m a type to complain a lot and my team manager told me I had to reach Paris and make a show of tenacity , &quot; Pantani said . 
&quot; On Sunday , I believe I went to the limits of suffering , especially on the Col de la Madeleine and today &apos;s victory taught me you must never give up , &quot; said the 27-year-old who has come back from a terrible leg injury in 1995 which put him out of action for 16 months . 
Pantani &apos;s victory has set up a fascinating battle for third place with Tour de France title holder Bjarne Riis . 
Pantani , third after his stage win at Alpe d &apos;Huez , had dropped to fourth behind Riis on Sunday . 
but the Italian , third overall in his previous Tour in 1995 , leapt back in front of the Dane on Monday with a 1 : 42 advantage . 
the pair are both more than 10 minutes behind leader Jan Ullrich with Frenchman Richard Virenque second , 6 : 22 adrift of the German . 
&quot; My objective was more to win the stage than to narrow the gap with Riis , &quot; said Pantani . 
&quot; This third place is quite uncertain , &quot; he said as he looked ahead to the second time trial of the Tour on the penultimate stage at Disneyland . 
&quot; It &apos;s a 63-km time trial . 
I &apos;m not a specialist and Riis can recover several minutes , &quot; he said . 
Pantani was 34 seconds slower than the Dane in the 12th stage time trial on a 55-km circuit around St Etienne on Friday . 
&quot; I &apos;m sure I &apos;m one of those who lost most minutes in the first week , &quot; Pantani said of his relative lack of strength on the flat stages . 
but speaking of his command of the conditions in the mountains , he said : &quot; I can do a lot of damage when I attack . 
it &apos;s psychologically good . 
Riis , fighting to reach the podium on the Champs Elysees for the third year in succession after his third place in 1995 and victory last year , believes he has done as well as could be expected . 
&quot; But there are others stronger than me and I have to accept that .
