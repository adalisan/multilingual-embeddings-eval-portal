Mikhail Markhasev , an 18-year-old Ukrainian immigrant , pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to murdering entertainer Bill Cosby &apos;s son , Ennis , in January . 
Markhasev was arraigned in court on one charge of murder with special circumstances , which could carry the death penalty , and another charge of attempted robbery . 
superior Court Judge John Reid gave the prosecution until May 30 to decide whether to pursue the death penalty in the event Markhasev was found guilty , and set a hearing on the matter for that date . 
Markhasev , handcuffed and dressed in a blue prison jumpsuit , did not speak during the brief , two-minute arraignment . 
the not-guilty pleas were entered by his court-appointed attorney , Henry Hall . 
the suspect , who was kept behind a glass partition , smiled and looked around the packed courtroom during the hearing . 
the grand jury indictment , unsealed on Tuesday , said Markhasev , &quot; ... did wilfully , unlawfully and with malice aforethought murder Ennis Cosby , a human being . 
Cosby , 27 , a graduate student , was killed by a single bullet as he was changing a flat tire near the fashionable Bel Air section of Los Angeles in the early hours of Jan . 16 . 
on the special circumstances in the case , the indictment read , &quot; It is further alleged that the murder of Ennis Cosby was committed while the said Mikhail Markhasev was engaged in the attempted commission of the crime of robbery . 
but Reid refused to unseal the transcripts of the grand jury hearing , saying to do so &quot; may prejudice the defendant &apos;s right to a fair trial . 
however , he set a hearing for May 16 to hear further arguments from attorney Kelly Sager , representing several news organisations who want the transcripts unsealed . 
outside the courtroom Hall , who asked for the transcripts to be sealed , said he would fight any effort to make them public . 
&quot; Every pundit in the world would be sitting there chewing on a one-sided presentation and we don &apos;t have the right to cross-examine , &quot; Hall said , referring to the grand jury system in which only prosecutors present evidence . 
asked how his client was doing , Hall replied , &quot; He is still a kid . 
I would say he &apos;s doing the best he can under the circumstances .
