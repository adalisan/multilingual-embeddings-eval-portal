Zimbabwe called on Thursday for drastic change at the Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development ( PTA Bank ) which last year realised a return on capital employed of just 2.1 percent . 
&quot; I urge you to take a hard look at the profit returns the bank has made so far and deliberate new and better profitability strategies for the bank , &quot; Zimbabwe Vice-President Simon Muzenda told the bank &apos;s 13th annual general meeting in Harare . 
&quot; shareholders are happy when there is a high return on their investments , &quot; Muzenda added , pointedly referring to the bank &apos;s comparatively low returns on the capital employed in recent years . 
audited accounts for the year ended December last year show the bank made a net profit of UAPTA 1.27 million ( U.S. $ 909,285 ) on paid in capital of UAPTA 61.01 million ( U.S. $ 43.5 million ) , a dramatic improvement on 1995 when it could only manage just UAPTA 199,373 ( U.S. $ 142,409 ) a yield of 0.3 percent . 
Zimbabwe , which together with Zambia , Tanzania and Malawi tried to pull out of the bank in 1995 in protest against alleged financial mismanagement , is alongside Kenya , the biggest shareholder with a 12.09 percent stake . 
Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza told Reuters in an interview that the bank could have performed better and said the governors , comprising ministers of finance from member countries , were now taking measures to ensure the growth was sustained . 
&quot; It is a fragile institution and the governors are taking their responsibility very seriously , &quot; Penza said . 
venting the frustration of the Zimbabweans , Muzenda called for a revision of the bank &apos;s charter , which forbids member countries from withdrawing , saying banking and economic environments have changed . 
&quot; It makes little sense for a shareholder to be stopped from dis-investing from a non-performing asset , &quot; a Zimbabwean official told Reuters . 
Zimbabwe tried to withdraw from the institution after bank President Martin Ogang , a Ugandan , fired , Webster Masvikwa , the then director of finance , over allegations Ogang mismanaged the bank in 1994 , leading to a $ 3.8 million loss . 
Masvikwa &apos;s successor Jotham Kotamo of Malawi , quit the bank in January this year after five months in office , citing irregularaties in the award of loans . 
Ogang has flatly denied the accusations . 
the PTA Bank is owned by 14 eastern and southern African countries as well as the African Development Bank .
