lawyers for accused CIA double agent Harold J. Nicholson asked a federal judge on Monday to pay for a trip to the site in Singapore of a meeting with Nicholson &apos;s alleged Russian handlers . 
in a motion filed on Monday at the district court in Alexandria , Virginia , Nicholson &apos;s lawyers said they wanted court funds to take the espionage suspect with them to Singapore . 
they proposed that he be escorted at all times by U.S. marshals . 
separately , the judge in the case denied another defence motion that he step down because of his role in an ultra-secret national security court . 
defence lawyers said they planned to challenge the constitutionality of the secret court &apos;s recently expanded physical search powers . 
Nicholson , the highest-ranking Central Intelligence Agency officer to face spy charges , has pleaded not guilty to selling national security secrets to Moscow for 29 months until his Nov . 16 arrest . 
prosecutors have said they may seek the death penalty if he is convicted . 
according to the criminal complaint against him , Nicholson handed documents to Russian agents in Singapore on June 27 , 1996 , after travelling there privately . 
an FBI affidavit detailed how he allegedly sought to shake any surveillance before tucking a camera bag in the trunk of a car that bore diplomatic license plates registered to the Russian embassy , then slid into the car &apos;s back seat . 
&quot; We want to visit the scene of the alleged crime , &quot; said Michael Lieberman , an attorney working with Nicholson &apos;s co-lead counsels , Jonathan Shapiro and Liam O &apos;Grady . 
Nicholson , 46 , was a 16-year CIA veteran who served as station chief in Romania from 1990 to 1992 before becoming deputy chief of station and operations officer in Malaysia . 
earlier , he was posted to the Philippines , Thailand and Japan . 
U.S. Assistant Attorney Robert Chesnut , the chief prosecutor in the case , told the court that the government approved of court funding for the defence &apos;s proposed trip , but opposed letting Nicholson himself leave the country . 
U.S. District Judge James Cacheris , the judge in the case , did not immediately rule on the travel motion . 
but in denying the request that he recuse himself , he said he planned to stick to a timetable so that Nicholson &apos;s jury trial may begin , as scheduled , on April 14 . 
in their motion seeking a new judge , Nicholson &apos;s court-appointed lawyers argued that Cacheris may have a conflict in the case because he had , as a sitting member of the secret court , approved orders used to break into Nicholson &apos;s car and gather evidence without a normal search warrant . 
at issue is the seven-member court set up under the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) . 
after the conviction in 1994 of CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames as a Moscow spy , President Bill Clinton signed an executive order giving the court the power to authorise warrantless physical searches in addition to its existing warrantless wiretap authority . 
Jonathan Turley , a professor at George Washington University Law School who has joined Nicholson &apos;s defence team , told the court that Nicholson &apos;s case would present the first constitutional challenge of the FISA court &apos;s authority to order physical searches without conventional warrants . 
Cacheris , in his ruling , expressed no opinion on whether the constitutional protections differ for physical searches versus electronic surveillance . 
&quot; This Court holds , and will maintain , an open mind concerning any novel challenges this defendant raises concerning FISA , &quot; he wrote .
