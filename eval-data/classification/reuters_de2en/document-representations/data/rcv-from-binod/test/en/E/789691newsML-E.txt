the National Bank of Poland may again tighten its monetary policy because commercial banks are not sufficiently raising credit and deposit rates after last week &apos;s official interest rate increase , a NBP official said . 
&quot; We are still waiting for the reaction of ( the state savings bank ) PKO BP , but basically we already know that the hitherto ( rate ) increases in commercial banks are too small , &quot; the Rzeczpospolita daily quoted NBP monetary policy head Jerzy Stopyra as saying . 
&quot; We may use other ( monetary policy ) instruments , &quot; he said . 
Stopyra said the central bank could open deposit accounts for the public , create credit ceilings for commercial banks , increase obligatory reserves or further up intersest rates . 
on August 4 the NBP increased its Lombard rate by two points to 27 percent and discount by 2.5 to 24.5 percent . 
he said that as a result of the official rate rise commercial banks increased their credit rates by between one and 1.5 points but that they barely changed their deposit rates , which was alarming . 
he said the reaction has so far been too small to curb credit expansion ahead of the upcoming wave of cash outflow caused by flood-relief credits . 
&quot; In the nearest several months funds for people hit by the flood will be paid out and ( flood ) credits will start . 
so the worst may still be ahead , &quot; the daily quoted Stopyra as saying . 
Stopyra said that according to very preliminary NBP estimates broad money supply in July increased by 6.2 billion zlotys or four percent . 
troublesome credit action grew about 2.3 billion , or 2.5 percent , last month , he added .
