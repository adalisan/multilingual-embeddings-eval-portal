U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry said on Saturday that NATO had no plans to move nuclear weapons into new member states along Russia &apos;s borders but was making no promises to Moscow on the subject . 
replying to reporters &apos; questions during a flight from Washington , Perry also noted that Moscow had resisted pressure to slash its arsenal of short-range tactical nuclear arms . 
asked if he could conceive of giving Russia a promise that nuclear arms would not be based in Eastern European countries that might gain future membership in NATO , Perry said : 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we &apos;re to the point where anybody &apos;s ready to make guarantees or commitments . 
&quot; I think NATO would want to see what &apos;s happening in the world , what &apos;s happening in Russia &quot; before making any promise , he said . 
&quot; But there is no interest and no plan in NATO today for either increasing the number , the quantity , of ( nuclear ) weapons or increasing places where they are based . 
the secretary , beginning a 10-day trip to Finland , Sweden , Denmark and Norway , had lunch on Saturday with Finland &apos;s President Martti Ahtisaari and also held talks on Bosnia and other security issues with Defence Minister Anneli Taina . 
he said Finland , which is in the process of taking delivery of 64 U.S.-build F-18 fighter jets , could be a good influence on neighbouring Russia on behalf of the West . 
Finland , which is militarily non-aligned , is not a member of NATO and is not pressing to join the alliance as are its smaller Baltic neighbours Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania . 
&quot; It is veru important that Russia &apos;s concerns are taken into consideration , &quot; Taina told reporters at a joint press conference with Perry . 
she said Finland , which shares a long common border with Russia , would work to alleviate Moscow &apos;s worries over NATO expansion to make sure that those concerns did not effect Baltic security . 
Perry said aboard his aircraft earlier that Washington had urged Moscow to cut its Cold War battlefield nuclear arsenal commensurate with deep cuts in strategic and intermediate-range nuclear arms made by Russia and the United States , even though those tactical arms are stored far from Western Europe . 
he told reporters he understood Russia &apos;s concerns about NATO expansion and that he strongly supported proposals for a new NATO charter giving Moscow a non-voting voice in alliance affairs . 
the matter , Perry said , will be discussed in depth at an informal meeting of NATO defence ministers which he will attend in Bergen , Norway , on Wednesday and Thursday . 
Perry told reporters that he would push for Russian participation in NATO committees &quot; so they will have an opportunity to learn about what NATO is doing formally and to influence what NATO is doing formally . 
Russians , he said , should participate in deliberations of the committee which deals with nuclear weapons although he stopped short of supporting Russian membership on the committee . 
&quot; We must get a meaningful , in-depth , concrete discussion of the future of nuclear weapons in Europe . 
and to do that -- I &apos;m talking about theatre tactical nuclear weapons -- we need to get the players together on that , &quot; Perry added . 
Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov will attend a special session at the NATO meeting , which is also expected to take up the matter of whether and how any new international force of military peacekeepers might be sent back to Bosnia next year . 
on Thursday , Rodionov , Perry and Norway &apos;s Defence Minister Joergen Kosmo will sign an agreement under which the three nations will cooperate to halt and perhaps even clean up nuclear and other waste dumped by Russia &apos;s military in the vast Arctic .
