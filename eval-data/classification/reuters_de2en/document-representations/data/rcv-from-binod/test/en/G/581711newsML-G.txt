Juventus ace Alessandro Del Piero is not certain to stay at the Turin club , Italian newspapers reported on Wednesday . 
sports dailies Tuttosport and Corriere Dello Sport both highlighted comments from honorary president Umberto Agnelli implying the European champions might sell the striker if the price were right . 
&quot; I hope that Del Piero ... continues to play for Juventus , &quot; Agnelli said . 
&quot; Certainly , if people are offering ... $ 21 million dollars for Del Piero the club has an obligation to examine the offers . 
there has been widespread speculation about Del Piero &apos;s future in the past week with reports claiming English club Newcastle United are among many to have enquired about him . 
the 22-year-old has been injured for the last 10 weeks but he has been one of the key figures in the Juventus success story of the last three seasons . 
he has helped them win the Italian title in 1995 , the European Cup in 1996 , lead the title race this season and reach the European Cup final again . 
with four games to play in the championship , Juventus currently lead serie A by four points from Parma . 
Agnelli &apos;s words carry weight as he speaks on behalf of the Agnelli family , the major shareholders in automobile giant FIAT who effectively own Juventus . 
until recently , most commentators had assumed Del Piero was certain to stay with Juventus . 
the player himself said this week : &quot; fact is , I want to stay here . 
in the end , all these rumours about my possible leaving are inevitable . 
if the club were to sell Del Piero , it would continue a tradition established in recent seasons during which they have off-loaded stars like Roberto Baggio to AC Milan , Gianluca Vialli to Chelsea and Fabrizio Ravanelli to Middlesbrough .
