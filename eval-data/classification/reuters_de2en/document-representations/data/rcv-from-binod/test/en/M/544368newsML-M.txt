Spain &apos;s debt market closed on Monday with strong gains , supported by a stronger peseta and by a rebounding Italian market . 
but traders expected a touch of profit taking on Tuesday and Wednesday ahead of Spain &apos;s public holidays on Thursday and Friday . 
a flurry of U.S. data this week also put the market on the edge . 
there &apos;s virtually no market , &quot; said a dealer at ABN AMRO in Madrid . 
he added that the long-term future offered strong resistance at around 113.20 . 
it closed on Monday at 113.19 . 
&quot; Peripheral markets outperformed German Bunds today because of the dollar . 
but I do not expect any major movement until the U.S. data is out , &quot; said a Madrid-based dealer . 
dealers remained positive on the outlook for the short end , with the market expecting the Bank of Spain to soon cut its official money market rate once more . 
a stronger peseta , trading late on Monday at around 84.28 / 30 per mark versus 84.33 / 35 on Friday , supported the view of a possible easing in the second half of May , dealers said .
