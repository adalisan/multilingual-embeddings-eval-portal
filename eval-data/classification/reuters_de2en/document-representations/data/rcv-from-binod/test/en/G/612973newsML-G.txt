the head of Islam &apos;s most prestigious seat of learning said in remarks published on Sunday that Palestinians who sold their land to Israel were committing &quot; grand treason &quot; and should be executed . 
Mohammed Sayed Tantawi , Grand Sheikh of the Cairo-based al-Azhar , was quoted by the official al-Ahram daily as saying he supported &quot; the death penalty for Palestinians who sold their land to Jews &quot; . 
the Palestinian Authority , concerned by an Israeli government drive to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank , this month banned land sales to Jews and its justice minister said a Jordanian law which provides for the death penalty would be applied against offenders . 
Israel said last Wednesday it would complain to the U.N. commission on human rights over the land sale ban and death penalty , saying they &quot; reeked of anti-Semitism &quot; . 
Palestinians say the purchase of land by Jews and Israeli settlement building in Jerusalem , the rest of the West Bank , and Gaza pre-empts final peace talks on the fate of the occupied areas where they hope to establish an independent state . 
Tantawi , considered a liberal among Egyptian Moslem clerics , earlier this month advocated taking Jerusalem by force if peace talks with the Jewish state failed . 
those killed in the fighting would be martyrs , he added .
