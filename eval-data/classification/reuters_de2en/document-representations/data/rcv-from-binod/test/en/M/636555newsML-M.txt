Mexico &apos;s Deputy Finance Minister Martin Werner said on Wednesday he could see the peso adjusting this year towards levels indicated on the futures market and any change in its value would not be smooth . 
&quot; What we &apos;ve learnt in the past from the way floating regimes work in the world is that it &apos;s not a smooth movement , it &apos;s always in jumps and it ( depends on ) trading levels , &quot; he said in an interview . 
&quot; So if we &apos;re going to get between now and December somewhere close to where the forward ( December future contract ) is , at some point we will have some adjustments . 
the Mexican peso is currently trading at 7.91 to the dollar . 
but peso futures contracts traded in Chicago indicated expectations of 8.61 pesos to the dollar by December 1997 . 
the Mexican currency has held at stronger-than-expected levels for most of this year and analysts warn it needs to depreciate to keep Mexican exports at strong levels . 
&quot; Some people sometimes get a little anxious when this jump does not happen , but this is the way floating regimes work , &quot; Werner said . 
&quot; We feel that the floating regime is the best one for Mexico and it will deliver us over the medium term a competitive exchange rate . 
Mexico &apos;s inflation differential with its main trading partner the United States was continuing to diminish and this would help smooth out currency adjustments . 
&quot; These adjustments used to be traumatic in Mexico , as happened over September and October 1995 , but now every time we have these adjustments the market becomes more used to them , &quot; he said , adding the development of Mexico &apos;s fledgling derivatives market would help protect against any sudden move . 
&quot; The derivatives markets ... are starting to develop so people can hedge better against these risks , &quot; he said . 
but he declined to comment on whether he felt the peso was fairly valued at present . 
&quot; We would be worried if we saw substantial amounts of short term capital flows coming into Mexico and making the peso very , very strong , but today we &apos;re not seeing those huge , very short-term , volatile flows , &quot; he said .
