copper staged a dramatic rally on Wednesday , barrelling through key resistance levels to 8-1 / 2 month highs in a move traders attributed largely to technical factors . 
&quot; When it takes off , it really takes off . 
this morning we saw fresh fund buying after prices breached $ 2,300 and it triggered buy-stops , &quot; a trader said . 
traders also said it was &quot; very likely &quot; buying had emerged from China and other South East Asian countries . 
the morning kerb ended with three months copper at $ 2,343 per tonne , compred to Tuesday &apos;s kerb close of $ 2,286 and the highest since June 1996 when prices plunged as the Sumitomo scandal unfolded . 
but prices were off an early high of $ 2,360 as traders took profits following the sharp increase . 
nevertheless the move was very constructive for copper , on the back of Tuesday &apos;s positive close , since it took prices above last year &apos;s November 28 high of $ 2,313 -- a critical hurdle for future gains , analysts said . 
the $ 2,360 level and then $ 2,375 area would provide the next areas of resistance , traders said . 
an ascending triangle formation also targetted $ 2,450 in the longer term . 
traders noted growing concerns about the resumption of recent tightness in the market . 
last month cash to three months soared above $ 300 before easing ahead of Monday &apos;s Third Wednesday pricing . 
&quot; Its very tight moving into the peak demand period of March-June , &quot; said analyst Robin Bahr of brokers Brandeis . 
people will buy because they don &apos;t want to miss the boat . 
you tend to get restocking in a rising market . 
borrowing in April dates helped the cash / threes flare to a backwardation of $ 85 / $ 90 in the rings , $ 10 more than Tuesday , before it settled at $ 83 / 88 at the end of the kerb . 
copper &apos;s surge fuelled parallel rallies in nearly all of the other base metals . 
aluminium gapped hihger in the morning , surging back above $ 1,600 to end the morning kerb at $ 1,609 , a gain of $ 23 . 
&quot; It &apos;s actually doing it &apos;s own thing . 
Tuesday &apos;s close was technical , which pointed to $ 1,600- $ 1,620 today , &quot; a trader said of aluminium . 
nickel surged nearly $ 200 to end the kerb at $ 7,860 , versus $ 7,665 on Tuesday . 
zinc ticked up $ 12 to $ 1,225 , while tin was just $ 5 firmer at $ 6,070 .
