the House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a broad-ranging illegal immigration bill and a separate measure giving states power to deny schooling for children of illegal aliens . 
Democrats protested vigorously against provisions in the larger bill , but 76 of them joined with the majority to pass the Republican-drafted measure 305-123 . 
democratic critics charge the bill is &quot; mean-spirited &quot; toward legal immigrants and people seeking asylum and too lenient toward employers of illegal aliens . 
measures to stem the tide of illegal aliens coming into the country are politically potent in an election year and the bill had become entangled in presidential election politics . 
however , President Bill Clinton appeared to be leaving his options open on signing the bill and Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle had hinted at a possible filibuster when it reached the Senate . 
the separate school ban had previously been part of the House version of the illegal immigration bill after being added during debate last March by California Republican Elton Gallegly . 
Clinton threatend to veto the entire bill if it included the Gallegly amendment . 
the provision was not in the Senate-passed immigration bill . 
after months of delay and a rewrite of the provision Republicans , with the gruding concurrence of presidential candidate Bob Dole , separated it out this week , paving the way for votes on both measures . 
the vote on the schools measure was 254-175 , not far from the 257-163 vote in March and , as it was then , preceded by an appeal for its support by House Speaker Newt Gingrich . 
in a rare floor speech , he said the bill prospectively &quot; sends the signal to the world : don &apos;t come to America and think the taxpayers of America are going to take care of you if you are here illegally . 
the earlier Gallegly provision would have allowed states to remove current illegal alien students from public schools . 
the revised version approved on Thursday would allow children now in school to remain there . 
States would be able to charge fees to children who wanted to move up from elementary to secondary school or who moved to a school in another district . 
the law would require a new vote by Congress to continue it beyond 2-1 / 2 years . 
Senate Democrats want the main bill changed to meet their concerns and a White House spokeswoman said the president was talking to members of Congress about strengthening enforcement of laws on hiring illegal aliens . 
during the House debate , Democrats voiced anger at being left out of the drafting of the bill , which they said was done in &quot; back rooms &quot; in concert with the Dole campaign . 
they also complained it would require Americans who wanted to bring a close family member to the United States to meet financial standards that would be beyond low-income people . 
proponents of the bill said it would ensure that sponsors of immigrants were held to their commitment to make sure their relatives were not a drain on taxpayers . 
critics also denounced provisions tightening up on admission of people arriving in the country without documents in search of asylum , saying it gave too much latitude to immigration inspectors . 
Democrats charged that the bill removed safeguards for Americans such as Hispanics against discrimination by employers fearful of hiring aliens , and did not do enough to crack down on employers hiring illegals . 
they criticised provisions they said would make legal immigrants liable for deportation if they used certain welfare programmes for more than a year , including tax-financed health care for people with AIDS . 
the bill would double the size of the border patrol , adding 5,000 new agents and 1,500 support personnel over five years , beef up penalties for alien smuggling and document fraud and speed removal of illegal aliens . 
it would set up pilot projects for employers to verify their workers &apos; immigration status and stengthen barriers against illegal aliens getting welfare benefits .
