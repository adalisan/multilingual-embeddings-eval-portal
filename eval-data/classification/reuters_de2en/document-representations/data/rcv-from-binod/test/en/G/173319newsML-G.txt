Pakistan &apos;s ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto met her detained husband Asif Ali Zardari in the early hours of Thursday for the first time since her dismissal two days earlier , her spokesman said . 
the spokesman , Shah Mahmood Qureshi , said Bhutto had been taken to see Zardari at an official resthouse near Islamabad at about 9.30 p.m. on Wednesday , but had been made to wait for more than four hours before her husband was produced . 
&quot; Zardari was in good spirits and so was Bhutto , &quot; said Qureshi , former state minister for parliamentary affairs . 
he said he had not been at the meeting and had no other details . 
the couple &apos;s reunion took place hours after Bhutto had threatened to bring kidnapping charges against President Farooq Leghari , who sacked her three-year government on Tuesday . 
Zardari was picked up by soldiers in Lahore on Tuesday and later transferred to Rawalpindi . 
the caretaker government said on Wednesday that he was in &quot; protective custody , &quot; but did not clarify the grounds on which he was being held . 
Zardari is the target of corruption allegations levelled against Bhutto &apos;s government and has also been accused of conspiring to murder Bhutto &apos;s brother Murtaza , killed by police in Karachi on September 20 . 
Zardari has denied the charges . 
&quot; Asif Zardari is in protective custody . 
it means there is something against him , some inquiry may be on , or something else may be considered , &quot; Information Minister Irshad Haqqani said on Wednesday . 
a combative Bhutto , speaking on Wednesday at her first news conference since being dislodged , demanded the resignation of Leghari and promised to fight her dismissal in court . 
&quot; We expect the court to restore the ( National ) Assembly within a month , &quot; Bhutto said at her official residence , where police had kept her for 36 hours before lifting curbs on her . 
her fight to the finish added fresh uncertainty to an already turbulent political scene . 
Leghari said he had sacked Bhutto because her government was tainted by corruption , nepotism and misrule , and had allowed security forces to kill &quot; thousands of people &quot; . 
he entrusted the caretaker government led by Meraj Khalid with supervising general elections next February , calling on voters to elect &quot; honest , able and god-fearing people &quot; . 
in the meantime , it must cope with a crumbling economy and conduct crucial negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on reactivation of a $ 600 million standby loan . 
a government official said on Thursday that Javed Burki , a Pakistani now serving as vice-president of the World Bank in Washington , would take charge of the Finance Ministry . 
he said Burki would be adviser to the ministry but in charge of finance , economic affairs and planning . 
there would be no finance minister in the caretaker cabinet , he added . 
Burki criticised Bhutto &apos;s government in recent articles analysing what he called &quot; faultlines &quot; in Pakistan &apos;s economy . 
Bhutto appeared irritated by the articles , with newspapers quoting her in mid-September as denouncing &quot; some World Bank officials in Washington &quot; for creating problems for her government . 
the Karachi Stock Exchange , which had been warmed by the removal of Bhutto &apos;s government , woke up to a cold shower from Moody &apos;s , which cut Pakistan &apos;s credit ratings on Wednesday . 
the U.S.-based credit rating agency lowered Pakistan &apos;s sovereign ceiling foreign-currency debt rating to B2 from B1 . 
the move set off an immediate selling spree , sending the 100-share index plunging 3.5 percent by midday . 
&quot; The market has taken this as a signal that foreign buying will remain on hold for the moment , &quot; one dealer said . 
on Wednesday , the index rose 5.2 percent on Leghari &apos;s sacking of Bhutto and hopes of a new deal with the IMF .
