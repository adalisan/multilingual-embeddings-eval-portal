the curtain falls on London &apos;s Covent Garden Opera House on Monday for a controversial 2-1 / 2 year redevelopment designed to transform the creaking 19th century theatre into an arts venue fit for the 21st century . 
for behind the red plush , the chandeliers and the sumptuous opera and ballet productions , the Royal Opera House is literally falling apart , its technical facilities and backstage area a relic of the horse-drawn era in which it was born . 
dogged by rows over public funding and attacked for elitism , the 214 million pound ( $ 361 million ) re-development is finally going ahead with the aim of a re-opening in December 1999 . 
more seats , better access for the disabled , extra performances and state of the art technology are promised . 
the famous white-porticoed 1858 building itself is being kept intact , protected under Britain &apos;s heritage laws . 
but it will be thoroughly refurbished and a huge extension will house a new studio theatre , scenery stores , rehearsal rooms , and a cafe . 
the devoted Covent Garden audience and a star-studded cast bid farewell in a gala concert on Monday but few tears will be shed for the leaking roof in the paintshop or the 1901 submarine engine which powers much of the below stage machinery . 
&quot; No other great opera house in the world has had to wait so long for redevelopment . 
we have missed the 20th century altogether , &quot; said former Covent Garden chief executive Sir Jeremy Isaacs . 
while workmen move in to demolish the stage , the dancers and singers embark on a mixture of touring programmes and short stays at some of London &apos;s other theatres . 
plans for a new temporary home devoted entirely to the Royal Ballet and Royal Opera companies during the building work fell through last year and venues for productions will include the Albert Hall , the Barbican and the Royal Festival Hall . 
when the doors reopen in Covent Garden , the dancers of the Royal Ballet will for the first time be able to rehearse and perform on site , rather than traipsing across the capital by underground train from their present base in west London . 
out will go manual scene-shifting and lighting rigs , reducing the change-over times between different operas and ballets from six hours to 90 minutes . 
air conditioning and escalators will make life more comfortable for artists and audience alike and the theatre will be open all the year round . 
Placido Domingo , who with ballet dancers Sylvie Guillem and Darcey Bussell will top the bill in Monday &apos;s farewell gala , says the redevelopment is long overdue . 
&quot; The Royal Opera House audience loves tradition , is hugely knowledgeable and yet very warm . 
it deserves to have its theatre refurbished , just as the loyal staff need their working conditions improved . 
&quot; memories will be cherished on both sides of the curtain and the glories of the Royal Opera House preserved for a new generation of patrons and artists , &quot; Domingo said . 
the scheme was first mooted in the late 1970s but was postponed for lack of finance . 
Covent Garden finally got a 78 million pound grant from the National Lottery but was attacked for taking from the poor to pay for entertainment for the rich . 
more than 300 of the 820 staff at Covent Garden are to lose their jobs because of the redevelopment and the introduction of new labour-saving technology . 
the opera house got more bad press last month when it had to convert a swansong production of Verdi &apos;s &quot; Macbeth &quot; into a concert performance without scenery because of bad planning . 
Covent Garden intends to those who complain about elitism by offering more low-priced seats when it reopens in 1999 , opening on Sundays and extending the number of television broadcasts .
