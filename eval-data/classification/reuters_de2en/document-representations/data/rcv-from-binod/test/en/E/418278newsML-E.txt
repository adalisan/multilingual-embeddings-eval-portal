Portugal &apos;s economy expanded around three percent in 1996 and it can look forward to robust growth in 1997 , the deputy finance minister said . 
but stronger growth would not pose any threat to the government &apos;s target of cutting inflation this year , Fernando Teixeira dos Santos , State Secretary for the Treasury and Finance told Reuters . 
&quot; The information that we have is that real growth in 1996 was around three percent , and perhaps even 3.1 percent , &quot; Teixeira dos Santos said in an interview on Monday night . 
finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco said last week that economic output had exceeded the government &apos;s 2.75 percent forecast in 1996 . 
&quot; This could mean that , with luck , in 1997 we could also have a faster rate of growth than expected , &quot; Teixeira dos Santos said . 
the government has budgeted for growth of around three percent in 1997 . 
Teixeira dos Santos said that despite the government &apos;s tight budgetary policy , domestic demand was growing , thanks to some real growth in salaries in 1996 , while the sharp fall in interest rates had stimulated private investment . 
&quot; Without doubt the strong fall in interest rates stimulated private investment and this went hand in hand with the maintenance of a high level of public investment , &quot; he said . 
clearly , stronger than expected growth would ease the government &apos;s task of reducing the budget deficit to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 1997 , to meet single currency criteria , from four percent last year . 
he said that limits to salary growth , which will hold public sector wages to some three percent in 1997 , and the exchange rate policy being adopted by the Bank of Portugal would ensure that the faster growth did not translate into inflationary pressures . 
&quot; Our production system will be able to respond to this greater dynamism in demand , without generating inflationary problems , &quot; he said .
