a man armed with a shotgun and grenades seized a passenger aboard a Philippine ferry at sea and escaped with her on a life raft , the coast guard said on Sunday . 
before fleeing , the man demanded 50,000 pesos ( $ 1,925 ) from the crew and passengers but they could produce only 24,000 pesos ( $ 925 ) , which the man took before escaping with his hostage on Saturday , the coast guard said . 
the ferry , identified as the St Francis of Assisi , was following the raft at a distance and reporting its movements to the coast guard by telephone , coast guard commander Ernesto Caballero said . 
the coast guard said it did not know how many passengers were on the ferry but radio reports said more than 600 people were aboard . 
&quot; We do not want to get close to the life boat because the man might harm his hostage . 
we do not know how desperate he is , &quot; Caballero said by telephone . 
he said the man initially grabbed seven hostages while the ferry was cruising in central Philippine waters but freed six of them and took only one , a woman , with him on the raft . 
Caballero said the coast guard did not know what the man &apos;s motive and plans were but he was apparently headed towards one of the small islands in the Cuyo island group , 400 km ( 248.5 miles ) south of Manila . 
&quot; We have a welcome party there for him in case he makes for land , &quot; Caballero said .
