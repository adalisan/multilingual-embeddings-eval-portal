until last Wednesday , the release of third quarter Australian inflation and wages data this week were seen as confirming the moderate inflation outlook and opening the way for an interest rate cut in early November . 
now that scenario is no longer so certain -- not because of a change of heart on the data expectations , but because of the strong words of the Reserve Bank in its quarterly report on the economy contained in last week &apos;s October Bulletin . 
the door has not been slammed shut on the prospects of a rate cut , however , and many economists believe that one is still possible over the last two months of 1996 . 
&quot; We interpret the October Bulletin article as a little less friendly to a November rate cut , but it certainly doesn &apos;t stand in the way of a cut later this year , &quot; ANZ Treasury economists said in a commmentary . 
on Friday , Reuters surveyed 32 economists on what they saw as the likelihood of a rate cut occuring in November . 
forecasts on the possibility of a cut range from zero to 70 percent , with the median forecast coming in at 47.5 percent . 
economists said the tone of the Bulletin , especially its concerns on wages , were behind the deflation of expectations for a November rate cut , despite what are expected to be favourable wage and inflation numbers this week . 
Westpac senior economist John Peters said that before the release of the Bulletin , &quot; we thought these numbers depicting further abating wage and underlying price pressures would provide the RBA with a final &apos; green light &apos; to ease policy settings again in the near term . 
&quot; However , all bets are now off for a near term easing given the RBA &apos;s strongly articulated concerns about current wages pressures , &quot; he said , adding that Wesptac now saw an easing in the first quarter of 1997 . 
the RBA said in its article that a reduction in inflationary expectations and a weaker than expected economy would support the case for a rate cut . 
&quot; On the other hand , on current growth projections , and without evidence that wages are adjusting to the lower inflation environment , a relxation of monetary policy could have the effect of storing up problems for the future , &quot; the RBA said . 
some in the market felt the RBA may have been &quot; talking tough &quot; as a means to put some pressure on those in the wage negotiating process . 
also , the fact that the quarterly report was prepared before a weak September employment report , a fall in consumer sentiment and a sombre National Australia Bank quarterly business survey , boosted the likelihood of another cut in rate . 
further weakness in numbers such as employment or the third quarter capital expenditure survey due in late November would increase the chances of a rate cut , economists said . 
certainly this week &apos;s wages and inflation data are not going to stand in the way of an easing , they said . 
in annual terms , the median forecast is for a consumer price index of 2.3 percent , its lowest since the September 1994 quarter . 
the underlying rate , which removes seasonal and volatile items from the CPI and is the focus of monetary policy , is seen falling back under three percent to around 2.5 percent , while wages are expected to continue the moderation seen so far in 1996 and fall to around 3.7 percent in annual terms . 
colonial State Bank chief economist Hans Kunnen saw a rate cut in November as possible , rating it a 60 percent chance . 
&quot; To do nothing runs the risk of letting the economy grow well below its potential , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This means rising unemployment even though inflation is contained within the RBA &apos;s targets .
