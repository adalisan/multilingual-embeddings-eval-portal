almost a dozen members of Cambodia &apos;s royal family left the country on evacuation and special flights on Wednesday , three days after the ouster of Prince Norodom Ranariddh as first prime minister , witnesses said . 
Ranariddh &apos;s sister , Princess Bopha Devi , and his son , Prince Norodom Chakravuth , were the most prominent members of the royal family to leave on Wednesday . 
the Princess was believed to have been on a flight to Bangkok while Chakravuth left on a later flight to Singapore . 
some nine other members of the family , as well as senior officials from Ranariddh &apos;s royalist FUNCINPEC party and his cabinet , took flights out of the country to Singapore and Bangkok , the witnesses said . 
the airport was heavily guarded by forces loyal to Cambodia &apos;s powerful second premier , Hun Sen , but no attempts were made to stop the family members or the party officials from leaving , the witnesses said . 
officials at the royal palace in Phnom Penh were not immediately available for comment . 
Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh from power on Sunday after a weekend of heavy fighting between forces loyal to the two premiers in Phnom Penh .
