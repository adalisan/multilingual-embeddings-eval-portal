seven German tourists held hostage by Yemeni tribesmen survived on biscuits and a spicy dip during nine days of captivity in a cave , one of them said on Thursday . 
the men , freed by their captors on Wednesday , also said they often feared they would die in captivity in Yemen &apos;s southeastern province of Hadramaut after security forces besieged the area . 
&quot; We survived on food and water . 
sometimes we were provided with a special Yemeni spicy dip , &quot; Ulrich Warratz , 34 , a trumpet- player , told Reuters in the lobby of a luxury hotel . 
&quot; We sometimes felt afraid when kidnappers used to tell us that if Yemeni troops attacked , we would all be in danger , &quot; said the musician , wearing light blue jeans and a brown T-shirt . 
the seven were freed in the city of Mukalla in Hadramaut , 770 km ( 480 miles ) east of the Yemeni capital . 
the tribesmen who seized them while they were riding motorcycles through Wadi al-Dabaat , between Hadramaut and Mahra provinces on March 3 , on Tuesday changed their minds at the last minute about releasing them . 
&quot; I am happy to be freed safely , thanks to the efforts of the Yemeni leadership and the German embassy in Sanaa , &quot; said university student Lars Labedzki , at 23 the youngest member in the group who was kidnapped together with his father , 55 . 
&quot; The kidnappers were sometimes kind and sometimes not , &quot; he added . 
&quot; They were also afraid of an attack on them by the Yemeni army and threatened us that if they were attacked they would attack us too &quot; . 
Warratz said the group might return to Germany on Friday . 
other freed hostages refused to talk to reporters . 
two of the tourists fell ill during their ordeal and treated themselves with medicines they had brought from Germany . 
one had a high fever and the other suffered pain in a knee . 
after their release the tourists rushed to hotel rooms for their first showers in 10 days . 
a Yemeni security official told Reuters the government refused to heed the kidnappers &apos; demands , saying : &quot; We refuse to be subjected to blackmail . 
last-minute negotiations on Tuesday centred on the tribesmen &apos;s demand for a government amnesty . 
kidnapping is a common ploy in Yemen by tribesmen holding grievances against the government or foreign oil firms . 
dozens of tourists , diplomats and other foreigners have been seized in recent years in Yemen , one of the Arab world &apos;s poorest countries . 
the tribesmen have tried to use the foreigners , who have included a U.S. diplomat and a Saudi ambassador , as bargaining chips . 
the government usually responds by ordering security forces to besiege them .
