the system received ringing endorsements from NZRFU chairman Richie Guy , All Blacks captain Sean Fitzpatrick and All Blacks manager Mike Banks . 
&quot; This will shape the future of New Zealand rugby , &quot; Guy said . 
speaking on behalf of All Blacks management , Banks said having a clear structure in place for player movement among provinces &quot; will enhance what we have to do in the professional environment &quot; . 
the system has three basic principles . 
it will reward individual unions for developing young players and give an incentive for the unions to invest in &quot; grass roots &quot; rugby . 
the transfer market will be player driven . 
they will retain control of where they play their rugby , they cannot be forced to transfer and they cannot be prevented from transferring by their unions . 
the other main tenet of the system is a desire to encourage evenness of teams and competitive rugby in New Zealand . 
with that in mind , the system will protect unions &apos; player strengths by keeping a check on the number of players who can move to any one union . 
new Zealand players are split into 12 categories for the purpose of deciding the amount of compensation payable to unions losing players . 
those categories range from All Blacks test players down to players enrolled in the NZRFU rugby academy next year . 
top All Blacks are rated at a maximum of NZ $ 125,000 for compensation purposes . 
compensation payments range downwards to $ 2000 . 
a union will be entitled to acquire a maximum of five players in any one year . 
those five players are spilt among the categories , therefore preventing a union getting five leading All Blacks at one time . 
all transfers will take place in November .
