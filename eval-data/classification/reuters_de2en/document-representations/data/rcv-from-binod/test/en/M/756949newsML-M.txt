Naphtha prices edged up in quiet pre-weekend Tokyo trade , trailing overnight crude gains , market participants said on Friday . 
&quot; The market is already in a weekend mood , &quot; one naphtha trader said . 
Open-spec naphtha for both second-half September and first-half October was assessed at $ 208.00 / $ 208.50 per tonne , compared to $ 207.50 / $ 208.50 in late Thursday dealing . 
a South Korean trader , who has been aggressively buying in the past few days , was the only active player on Friday , bidding at $ 208.00 for near-term cargoes , traders said . 
in spreads , second-half September / second-half October remained flat after having trading at even on Thursday . 
in low sulphur waxy residue ( LSWR ) trading , Indonesia was rumoured to have allocated 2.7 million barrels for August lifting . 
although the August allotment was up by 400,000 barrels from initial July allocation of 2.3 million barrels , the volume is still too small to satisfy regional demand , traders said . 
some traders also said Indonesia has potential to supply 3.0 to 3.3 million barrels of LSWR for August , and is expected to allocate extra cargoes shortly .
