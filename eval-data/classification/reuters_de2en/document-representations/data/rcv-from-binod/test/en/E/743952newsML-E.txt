the French Socialist-led government on Monday introduced a number of changes to corporate taxation concerning capital gains and the tax rate . 
following is a break-down of the measures . 
asset gains , with the exception of shares in companies , will from now on be taxed as any other profit . 
they were taxed at a special 19 percent rate . 
the Finance Minister said this brought French taxation in line with the majority of countries . 
&quot; The strong inflation in the past which could have explained that these asset gains benefited from a reduced taxation has disappeared . 
there is therefore no longer a justification to distinguish between asset gains and profits , &quot; Dominique Strauss-Kahn said . 
in 1997 , the government expects to raise six billion francs from this measure . 
the rate of corporate tax ( Impot sur les societies or IS ) is currently 36.6 percent . 
this is made up of a 33.3 percent basic rate and a 10 percent surcharge on this rate introduced in 1995 under Prime Minister Alain Juppe . 
Strauss-Kahn said there would be an additional surcharge of 15 percent for 1997 and 1998 and this would be reduced to 10 percent in 1999 . 
this means that in 1997 and 1998 , the effective rate will be 41.6 percent -- an increase of five percentage points over the current rate . 
in 1999 the effective rate will come down again to 39.9 percent , still 3.3 percentage points above the current rate . 
currently , the French corporate tax rate is lower than that in Italy , Germany , Belgium and Japan but higher than in the Netherlands , the United States , Spain and Great Britain . 
the additional surcharge will not apply to small and medium-sized companies . 
firms with less than 50 million francs in annual sales will be exonerated from the surchage announced on Monday . 
Strauss-Kahn said that 80 percent of those companies being taxed would be exonerated due to this cut-off level . 
the government expects to raise 16 billion francs in 1997 from the higher effective rate .
