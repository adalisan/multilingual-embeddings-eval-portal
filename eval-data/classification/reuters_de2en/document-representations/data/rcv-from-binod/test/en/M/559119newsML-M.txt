Lithuania &apos;s central bank said on Monday that it was set to launch repo auctions but would not do so in the immediate future as the liquidity situation in the country &apos;s banks was fine for the moment . 
&quot; At the moment , the central bank sees no signs that banks will face liquidity problems in the next few days , &quot; Arvydas Kregzhde , the director of the bank &apos;s market operations department , told Reuters . 
&quot; The bank is ready to start the repo auctions , but will do so only when it is necessary , &quot; he said . 
he added that the central bank had signed repo agreements with eight of the country &apos;s 12 commercial banks . 
launching the repo auctions is the first step of the central bank &apos;s plan to gradually regain the instruments of monetary policy it lost when Lithuania adopted a currency board in 1994 . 
under the system , the central bank guarantees that it will have one dollar for every four litas in circulation , freezing the exchange rate at that level . 
the central bank says that the system has served its purpose of enforcing fiscal discipline and monetary stability during a tough stage in the country &apos;s transition to a market economy but can now be gradually removed . 
it says that the repo auctions are necessary to soak up excess liquidity in the country &apos;s banking sector , which is recovering from a crisis sparked in late 1995 by the surprise closure of two of its largest banks .
