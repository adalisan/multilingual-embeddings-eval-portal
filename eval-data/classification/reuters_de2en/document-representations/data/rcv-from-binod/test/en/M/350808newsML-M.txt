BUX futures closed higher for all maturities , with the March instrument outpacing others by jumping 135 points to 5,930 . 
&quot; ( On the spot market ) investors seem to have pumped fresh money into the market , &quot; said Attila Berecz of Raiffeisen Securities . 
&quot; Today , not only domestic investors but foreigners were also very active .

bullish sentiment pushed up a number of stocks , such as brewery Sopron and gas distributor Primagaz , both of which continued to benefit from corporate developments and plans , announced last week . 
both Sopron and Primagaz broke records already on Friday . 
Sopron surged to a new record high of 5,000 forints , before easing to finish at 4,905 forints , up 505 , on plans announced last week by its majority owner , Austria &apos;s Brau Union AG to merge Sopron with its other Hungarian unit Martfu .
