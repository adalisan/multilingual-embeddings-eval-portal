the Australian government &apos;s gross borrowing requirement is estimated to be A $ 5.5 billion in the year to end-June 1998 , the Australian Treasury said in its 1997 / 98 budget papers released on Tuesday . 
while the net borrowing requirement is negative in 1997 / 98 , with the government expected to repay A $ 5.2 billion of debt , the budget papers show the 1997 / 98 aggregate debt issuance programme is forecast to be around A $ 6.5 to A $ 7.5 billion . 
the gross borrowing requirement reflected allowance for the refinancing of A $ 10.5 billion of domestic debt maturities and A $ 200 million of foreign currency debt repayments . 
the 1997 / 98 forecast is the lowest net borrowing requirement since 1989 / 90 , and reflected an estimated headline budget surplus of A $ 6.4 billion which more than offset estimated payments of A $ 1.2 billion in public trading enterprise superannuation . 
the aggregate debt issuance programme was larger than the minimum implied by the gross borrowing requirement , providing flexibility to undertake some early repurchase of debt scheduled for maturity in out-years , Treasury said . 
such early repurchases could assist in smoothing the refinancing task associated with lumpy maturities , and also offered a number of additional advantages for management of the Commonwealth &apos;s funding risk . 
there was no net change in Treasury note stock or in cash balances planned for 1997 / 98 . 
Treasury said relative cost would be an important consideration in choosing between domestic and offshore sourcing of U.S. dollar requirements , with a direct offshore issue reducing the domestic issue programme . 
a detailed announcement on the government &apos;s debt management operations , including issuance strategies and indications of possible new benchmark lines and early repurchase operations , would be made in the new financial year , Treasury said . 
the negative net borrowing requirements projected from 1997 / 98 implied a reduction in the stock of government securities on issue .
