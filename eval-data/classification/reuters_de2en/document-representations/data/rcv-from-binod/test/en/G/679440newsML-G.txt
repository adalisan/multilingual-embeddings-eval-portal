once in while former Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg just can &apos;t resist the past . 
it &apos;s something that feels comfortable , &quot; said Borg , winner of 11 grand slam titles -- the most in the Open era . 
Borg , now 41 , left the game in 1983 when still at the top . 
but despite a series of personal problems which have overshadowed his accomplishments on court , he says he has no regrets over his decision to leave the game in 1983 . 
&quot; I left the game at 27 but I really don &apos;t regret my move , &quot; Borg , five times winner of Wimbledon and six times winner of the French Open , said . 
&quot; People say I could have played more , won more grand slams . 
as successful as the Swede was on court , with 62 tour titles , Borg &apos;s life has been far less spectacular away from it . 
he tried a brief comeback in 1992 , as much for money as for pride , but found the game had changed so much that he would be lucky to win a qualifying event . 
in March he was near bankruptcy due to a series of failed business dealings , saved from creditors by friends who could not bear to see one of the greatest tennis players of all time defeated . 
these days , the ever-cool Borg is once again on tour -- the ATP Seniors tour -- but this time using a metal racket . 
he says his taste for competitive tennis has been renewed , but with a difference . 
&quot; I &apos;m happy I &apos;m back playing tennis again ... I am really enjoying myself and it once again is a lot of fun , &quot; he said after narrowly beating old friend Guillermo Vilas in the tour &apos;s first event in Prague . 
&quot; I love to win and playing on the seniors tour is a chance to play against some of my best friends . 
Borg says he still closely follows the majors he once ruled , though from a more distant vantage point -- his living-room couch . 
and , on the eve of Wimbledon , what does the player who revolutionised the game with his deft touch and steady strokes from the baseline think of today &apos;s power game ? 
&quot; Sometimes it &apos;s not so much fun to see two guys who hit ace after ace but still you have a lot of great talent and tennis out there , &quot; Borg said . 
he believes that , with players becoming stronger and better-trained and with the advances in equipment , there is only one way for the game to go -- faster . 
&quot; This is the future of men &apos;s tennis . 
the fans better get used to it , &quot; he said . 
he is quick to add , however , that his odds-on favourite for this year &apos;s Wimbledon -- a tournament he won for the first time 21 years ago -- is not the hardest server but the player with the greatest finesse -- Pete Sampras . 
&quot; Pete would be my choice with his strong all-round skills but there are a lot of evenly-matched players , so there could still be a lot of upsets , &quot; Borg said .
