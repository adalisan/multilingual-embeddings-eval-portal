Monaco &apos;s Princess Stephanie filed for divorce from her husband and former bodyguard Daniel Ducruet on Monday after Italian magazines printed pictures of his sex romp with a Belgian stripper , her lawyer said . 
lawyer Thierry Lacoste &apos;s office said in a brief statement that Stephanie , 31 , glamorous daughter of Prince rainier and the late actress Grace Kelly , had begun divorce proceedings after a reconciliation meeting was unsuccessful on Sunday . 
the princess wrote to her father , as ruler of the tiny Riviera principality , and he was expected to refer the suit to the Monaco court of revision , which is likely to issue a final divorce ruling within three to five weeks , Lacoste said . 
the latest upheaval in the Monaco royal family came just before the Grimaldi family celebrates 700 years in power next year , claiming to be the longest-serving European royal dynasty . 
Prince rainier long opposed Stephanie &apos;s relationship with Ducruet , a former fish merchant and bodyguard , but finally accepted him into the family last year for the sake of their two children , Louis and Pauline , aged three and two . 
however , Italian magazines published explicit photographs last month of a naked Ducruet , 32 , cavorting with a former &quot; Miss topless Belgium &quot; , 26-year-old dancer and model Fily Houteman . 
the magazine Eva Tremila and its sister publication Gente printed pages of pictures of Houteman undressing Ducruet , the pair entwined on a sunbed and finally both naked by a poolside . 
the principality banned the magazines but copies circulated widely and a video was reported to be on sale at the nearby Italian border town of Ventimiglia . 
French media reported that Ducruet had flown to Morocco to avoid publicity after a public row with Stephanie which , like almost everything else in Monaco , was photographed and published in glossy French magazines .
