Belgian government bonds and futures sat back on Friday , taking a breather before Monday &apos;s National Day holiday , and awaiting news that would either propel the market above resistance levels and spark off a correction . 
&quot; We are looking for direction , &quot; said Conrad Fieremans at Kredietbank . 
the market had been holding up well despite recent releases of strong German and U.S. data , but it was looking toppish . 
&quot; We are owed a good correction , &quot; he said . 
technically , resistance levels had come into sight , notably 103 on frontmonth Bund futures FDBc1 and 115 on September U.S. T-bond contracts USc1 . 
Fieremans said 103 on the Bund future matched a yield of about 5.5 percent on the underlying bond . 
&quot; At that level we should see profit-taking . 
he expected OLOs to do no better or worse than Bunds , leaving the 10-year OLO / Bund yield spread in its current five to 10 basis point range . 
a correction might re-awaken interest in OLOs and other European hard currency bonds , currently undermined by mark weakness and relatively low yields . 
pressure for a downmove is expected to build up as evidence grows of a slow but steady , export-driven uptrend in Europe &apos;s economy , helped by the dollar &apos;s rise , particularly on currencies in the mark bloc , analysts said . 
Germany &apos;s IFO institute reported on Friday a rise in business confidence in June . 
some said there was also a downside risk to Monday &apos;s presentation of France &apos;s budget audit . 
&quot; How the government will cut the budget deficit to 3.2 to 3.3 percent without introducing an austerity plan beats me , &quot; one said . 
speculation centres on new corporate taxes rather than unpopular spending cuts . 
&quot; There has been lots of talk the outcome of the audit will disappoint , &quot; said Fieremans . 
the actual news might , as a result , spark some buying , but mainly of French paper . 
Paris government sources have said the audit would show the deficit at around 3.5 to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent norm set out in the Maastricht Treaty on Europe &apos;s 1999 single currency project . 
Fieremans said France too would benefit from a pick-up in European growth , which would help it cut the deficit . 
meanwhile , the Belgian franc remained under pressure against the mark and money market rates stayed firm . 
in defense of the franc the National Bank has been keeping money supply tight . 
on Friday it cut its allocation on its fixed-rate tender for seven-day advances by a third to 10.025 billion francs . 
one-week repos were at 3.73 / 78 percent , well above the 3.00 percent interest rate on the seven-day advances . 
one analyst said the squeeze in the money market was beginning to affect funding conditions in the wider OLO market too .
