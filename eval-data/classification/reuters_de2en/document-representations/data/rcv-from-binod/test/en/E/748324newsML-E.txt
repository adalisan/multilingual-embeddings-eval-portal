trends in entitlement spending point to a higher U.S. budget deficit after 2002 and the only way to tackle the problem is to cut spending , Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday . 
during the question-and-answer session of his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee , Greenspan said the structure of entitlement programs right now means that spending will outstrip the ability of taxpayers to support them . 
&quot; As a technical matter you cannot balance budgets over the long run by raising taxes , &quot; he added . 
&quot; The only way to address a long-term structural deficit budget problem is through expenditure side .
