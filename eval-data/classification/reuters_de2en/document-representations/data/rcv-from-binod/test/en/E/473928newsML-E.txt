the Dutch government plans just one bond issue in the second quarter of 1997 , the Finance Ministry said on Thursday . 
the ministry said it would announce details of the issue on Friday , May 23 and that tap sales of the bond would start on the following Monday , May 26 . 
a spokesman said the issue might be either a completely new bond or a re-opening of an earlier issue . 
in the first quarter of 1997 there was also just one conventional Dutch government issue , a 5.75 percent bond due February 2007 which raised 7.5 billion guilders . 
but the government also placed an additional six billion guilders &apos; worth of two existing bonds with the Finance Ministry &apos;s agency for gradual resale into the market . 
government bond issuance this year is expected to be much lower than the 33 billion guilders issued in 1996 , though full details of this year &apos;s issance programme have yet to emerge .
