COMEX copper ended slightly down ahead of an expected hike in LME stocks Tuesday , but the market will remain firm as long as the backwardation in London is strong , traders said . 
tight dates on LME from Jan 29 to mid-February , reflected in the backwardation , were now coming into play , and traders were waiting to see what became of the backwardation once these dates are past . 
&quot; My concern is that when the backwardation comes in , it will come in rather sharply with the spot month coming down sharply with it , &quot; said John Gross of the copper Journal . 
&quot; But despite the rises in inventories , they are still very low , and we do have a potential for another squeeze , &quot; Gross said . 
Most-active March COMEX copper went out 0.75 cent lower at 105.90 cents a lb , traded 107.65 to 105.75 cents , still within its recent trading range . 
spot January , which goes off the board Wednesday , ended 0.20 cent firmer at 111.20 cents . 
volume was estimated at 7,500 lots compared to Friday &apos;s official 9,755 lots . 
traders said the strong backwardation and tightness on LME was partly justifiable due to low stocks and strong demand , particularly in the United States , but its strength was exacerbated by speculative trading .
