serious discord and glum talk of looming failure dogged the Middle East crisis summit on Wednesday as President Bill Clinton gathered all his fellow leaders for a top-level push to avert diplomatic disaster . 
the White House announced that Clinton would issue a &quot; summarizing &quot; statement on the outcome of the summit at about at 2 : 30 p.m. EDT ( 1830 GMT ) . 
&quot; It will talk about what the nature of the discussions have been over the past few days and where we move from here , &quot; a senior White House official said . 
there was no indication any breakthrough had been achieved . 
U.S. spokesmen insisted Palestinian and Israeli negotiators were putting too gloomy a spin on the outlook as lower-level bargaining broke off and Clinton hosted a working luncheon with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan &apos;s King Hussein . 
&quot; We &apos;re in the midst of a negotiation here . 
people will say things to the press &quot; to try to advance their own cause , State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters . 
&quot; There are still problems and issues that divide them . 
we &apos;re offering ideas , &quot; Burns said . 
but he insisted the tone of talks had been &quot; quite constructive &quot; -- a stark contrast with the picture drawn by some of the Middle East participants . 
Palestinian sources in Jerusalem said their Washington negotiators had rejected a series of Israeli demands , and CNN quoted top Arafat adviser Nabil Shaath as saying after State Department negotiations broke up : &quot; We didn &apos;t agree on one thing . 
all of the problems still remain . 
in Jerusalem , one well-informed Palestine Liberation Organisation official told Reuters the Israelis had made a series of unacceptable demands for security guarantees and had in turn rejected key Palestinian peace requirements . 
&quot; The Palestinian side is studying issuing a statement to announce the failure of the summit but the Americans are intervening to stop them , &quot; this source said . 
Clinton called the two-day summit in hopes of rescuing the Middle East peace process from collapse after violence that killed 57 Palestinians and 15 Israelis in Gaza and the West Bank last week . 
the stakes for the summit rose on Wednesday when a calm that had prevailed in the region for a few days was broken and Israeli soldiers were reported to have shot one Palestinian dead and wounded five in two incidents in the West Bank . 
as the summit neared what appeared to be its final make-or-break hours , both sides agreed that one major sticking point was Israeli refusal to meet Arab demands -- backed by the United States in some accounts -- for an immediate partial pullback of Israeli troops from the West Bank city of Hebron . 
that is the last major town still patrolled by Israeli troops in the Palestinian-run West Bank . 
Israel declines to carry out a year-old promise for a partial withdrawal without stronger guarantees for security against Arab violence . 
&quot; We are not ready to separate these two questions ( withdrawal and security ) to make some general statements about peace and love and retreat from Hebron , &quot; Netanyahu cabinet minister Natan Sharanksy told Reuters Television . 
&quot; We cannot see any point of going ahead with the peace process without security measures , &quot; he said . 
&quot; At the last moment , they tried simply to insist on immediate implementation on one part without the other . 
as Wednesday &apos;s White House summit proceeded , U.S. presidential spokesman Mike McCurry declined to characterise the status of the talks other than to say : &quot; We &apos;re not encouraged , we &apos;re not discouraged . 
we &apos;re determined . 
McCurry had earlier indicated the talks might spill over into Thursday but said later he expected it to end on Wednesday as scheduled . 
hopes that tensions would be lowered were raised on Tuesday when Netanyahu and Arafat met alone for three hours in a White House residential library . 
their deputies then negotiated all night and into early Wednesday afternoon to resolve their differences . 
last week &apos;s fighting was sparked by Israel &apos;s decision to open another entrance to a tourist tunnel alongside Jerusalem &apos;s Temple Mount , holy to Moslems and Jews . 
but it also reflected Arab frustrations at what they consider Israel &apos;s slow pace in pursuing peace accords . 
Palestinians demand that Israel close the tunnel but the Israelis reportedly have refused even to discuss that .
