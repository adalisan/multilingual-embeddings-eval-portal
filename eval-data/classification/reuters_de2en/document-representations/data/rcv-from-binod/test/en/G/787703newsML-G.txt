suspected leftist rebels killed Jorge Cristo , a Liberal Party senator and staunch ally of President Ernesto Samper , in northeast Colombia on Friday , authorities said . 
a local military commander blamed the attack on National Liberation Army ( ELN ) guerrillas who are waging a campaign to disrupt local and congressional elections scheduled for late this year and early next year . 
Cristo , 67 , was shot six times as he left his office in Cucuta , the capital of Norte de Santander province . 
one of his bodyguards also died in the attack . 
&quot; Behind this crime are the terrorist hands of the ELN who have been spreading their hate across our province , &quot; Col. Victor Hugo Matamorros told reporters . 
Cristo was among a small group of leading Liberal Party politicians who persuaded Samper to run for the presidency in 1994 . 
he also took a leading role in defending Samper against accusations that he had knowingly accepted donations from the Cali drug cartel to fund his election campaign .
