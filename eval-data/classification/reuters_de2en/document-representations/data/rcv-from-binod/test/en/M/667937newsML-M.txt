gold bullion is likely to trade quietly at stable price levels on Tuesday , with the market comfortable between $ 340.00 and $ 345.00 an ounce , analysts said . 
similar trends are expected in silver , but the platinum group metals ( PGMs ) may continue to track lower , with palladium around the $ 200 / ounce level at present . 
PGMs - 
both platinum and palladium were slipping back in early European trading , following on from the trend seen in New York , and absorbing news that Russia may resume PGM exports in June , according to a TASS report . 
platinum fell back to test the $ 420 level , down from the overnight close of $ 429.00 / 430 , while palladium had edged down to $ 194 / 199 an ounce , against $ 200.50 / 201.50 
the market is likely to take a back seat again on Tuesday with attention and direction focused on the PGMs . 
&quot; People are in Prague for the gold conference . 
there does not appear to be to much movement , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; I think we will continue to stay in the range , &quot; a Swiss-based analyst said . 
prices may continue to edge up following the late move up in New York , with the very short-term targets of $ 342.50 and $ 343.50 within range . 
by the end of the week , if the technicals pan out , then there is the possibility of levels near $ 345 being reached . 
support , meanwhile , remains around $ 340.00 / 340.50 , the analyst said . 
at 0801 GMT spot gold was quoted at $ 341.65 / 342.15 , against the late Monday close of $ 342.40 / 342.70 . 
equally quiet conditions should prevail in silver , where the market has been comfortable above $ 4.70 for the last week or so , traders noted . 
&quot; We are slightly positive for the next few days , assuming that $ 4.68 and $ 4.70 can hold , &quot; the analyst said . 
if so , silver has the potential to stretch up to the $ 4.78 / 4.80 level within the next few days , he added . 
at 0801 GMT spot silver was quoted at $ 4.72 / 4.74 , up just one cent .
