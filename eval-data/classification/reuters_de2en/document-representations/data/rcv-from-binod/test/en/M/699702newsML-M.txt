copper prices gravitated towards the $ 2,400 level during Tuesday &apos;s LME ring and kerb trading , attempting to settle after a nervy morning when the market ranged between $ 2,430 and $ 2,383 . 
other metals were mixed although aluminium defended its hold on $ 1,600 and zinc heated up again to a new 6-3 / 4 year high . 
but the main area of attention was copper , the July spreads and nervousness ahead of Wednesday &apos;s option declarations for this month which promise to be lively . 
&quot; At the moment you cannot say what strike is going to be in play . 
it ( the market ) is jumping around all over the place , &quot; one trader said . 
copper fell soon after the opening , tumbling after a 3,175-tonne stock rise on investment selling which triggered delta sales against the imminent options . 
also at that time , spreads were softening with July / threes and cash / threes both nearing $ 120 backwardation . 
on Monday these rates were near $ 170 . 
however , the market rallied in the official sessions on simultaneous threes months support and borrowing of various July dates . 
July / threes traded at $ 125 , July / August between $ 90 and $ 92 , and July to early-August at $ 75 . 
last three months trade was at $ 2,396 , still down $ 26 from Monday &apos;s kerb close . 
traders expect a difficult 24 hours trading until the air clears after the option declarations . 
at present , the July date is between strikes at $ 2,500 and $ 2,500 . 
once the options are out of the equation , the market may rally as near-term fundamentals are still tight and the July prompt is two weeks away . 
zinc raced to a fresh 6-3 / 4 year high of $ 1,435 , mostly on speculative buying against a backdrop of underlying technical tightness . 
cash / threes is around $ 6.50 contango , but there is talk of major Far Eastern shorts battling against influential European merchants . 
stocks fell 950 tonnes with a net drawdown seen from the Singapore warehouse , which may yet see significant deliveries of Chinese metal . 
aluminium grimly held on to the $ 1,600 level despite being hit by speculative sales in the rings . 
Chart-linked buying is supportive but there is likely to be producer selling above this level . 
options on Wednesday should not provide any surprises at present levels . 
last business was at $ 1,602 , up $ 4 . 
the nickel market was less volatile and remained steady , albeit at lower levels after the sell-offs on Friday and Monday . 
it closed the morning $ 20 higher at $ 6,880 . 
lost output at Outokumpu &apos;s smelter in Finland hlped soften negative sentiment slightly , traders said . 
lead was helped by the run in zinc as well as solid borrowing of July / August and it concluded the kerb at $ 634 , up $ 7 . 
tin sagged on scattered liquidation and was $ 25 softer at $ 5,545 . 
Alloy was stable at $ 1,450 / 55 .
