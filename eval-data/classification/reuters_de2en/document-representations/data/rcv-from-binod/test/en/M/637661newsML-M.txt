traders looked for more profit taking on the latest leg of a rally which took nearby copper to an eight-month high last week . 
COMEX July copper was called down 0.20 to 0.50 cent from Tuesday &apos;s close of 117.10 cents a lb . 
but July copper &apos;s five-day moving average remains above its 21- and 55-day averages , analysts noted , suggesting the long uptrend remained intact . 
LME warehouse copper stocks rose just 50 tonnes to 132,550 tonnes in Wednesday &apos;s data , while COMEX copper stocks fell 237 short tons Tuesday to 42,395 short tons . 
since the start of May , LME copper stocks have fallen from 145,750 tonnes to 132,500 tonnes Tuesday , while COMEX inventories have dropped to 42,632 short tons Monday , from 49,520 at the beginning of May . 
meanwhile , workers at INCO Ltd in Ontario , Canada , remained on strike at the company &apos;s nickel and copper mine at Sudbury and the refinery in Port Colborne , but the company said customers would not be affected . 
the Ontario division produces about 90,000 tonnes of copper , most of which is supplied to the U.S. North East market .
