a Cambodian mine-clearance expert told an international conference on Thursday that landmines are the biggest blight on the future of his country and would be a problem for decades . 
Cambodian Mine Action Centre national director Sam Sotha said that after four years of work , his teams had managed to clear only about five percent of the land that needed to be scoured for landmines after Cambodia &apos;s decades of war . 
&quot; Mines are the most significant obstacle to Cambodia &apos;s development , &quot; Sotha told delegates from 38 countries and several international organisations involved in mine clearing . 
Sotha was addressing the first day of the two-day Tokyo Conference on Anti-Personnel Landmines aimed at coordinating international efforts to achieve a global ban on the production and use of landmines . 
the conference also aims to coordinate the development of new technologies and support for land clearance programmes and assistance for landmine victimes . 
United Nations statistics show that more than 110 million landmines remain buried in 68 countries , including Cambodia , Afghanistan , Mozambique , Angola , Bosnia and Egypt . 
more than 20,000 people are killed or maimed a year by landmines buried in former or current war zones -- more than one person every 20 minutes , U.N. statistics show . 
after conflicts have ended , every one in four victims is a child . 
Sotha said mines had given Cambodia the highest percentage of amputees in the world -- around one in 246 people . 
&quot; Land mines claim up to 300 victims each month and make unavailable thousands of hectares of fertile land which could be used for food production , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Clearance of 3,000 square kilometres ( 1,160 sq miles ) of mined territory is proceeding slowly . 
over four years we have cleared around 129 square kilometres ( 50 sq miles ) and are prioritising land around schools , hospitals and land needed for rural development , &quot; he said . 
Norwegian People &apos;s Aid &apos;s Svein Henriksen said a consensus on the &quot; Ottawa Process &quot; -- begun in October in Canada and aimed at a legally binding international ban on the production , stockpiling , export and use of land mines by this December -- was possible but only among a limited club of countries . 
&quot; The momentum is there to reach the first comprehensive agreement in Ottawa in December this year for a ban on the production and use of landmines , &quot; Henriksen said . 
&quot; But the signatories will be those countries which no longer produce mines . 
there must be an effort to expand the agreement to those countries which are not yet on board . 
China and Russia have not taken part in the Ottawa talks which included other big mine manufacturers , the United States , Britain and France . 
Henriksen said the long-term nature of mine-clearing meant projects involving it should be part of overall development programmes of countries concerned . 
&quot; Cambodia &apos;s 2,000-man operation ... will continue for decades . 
Cambodia is equal in size to two of Angola &apos;s 18 provinces . 
how many de-miners do we need to train in Angola -- 20,000 ... 30,000 ? 
&quot; he said . 
&quot; The biggest problem in landmine clearance is the slowness of conventional techniques . 
new techniques such as using dogs and new mine-sweeping machines are available . 
it &apos;s important to consider the possibilities of local resources so that mine clearance operations don &apos;t become dependent on international aid , &quot; Henriksen added . 
in a message to the conference Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto urged a total global ban on landmines . 
&quot; anti-personnel land-mines not only create enormous humanitarian problems by indiscriminately inflicting injury and death on civilians both during and after armed conflicts , they also constitute a huge impediment to recovery and development after conflicts have been resolved , &quot; his message said .
