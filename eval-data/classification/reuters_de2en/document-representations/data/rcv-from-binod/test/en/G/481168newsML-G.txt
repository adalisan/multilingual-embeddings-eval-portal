Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn said on Wednesday Hungary would not be sending troops to Albania despite a request from Italy to do so . 
after all-party discussions in parliament it was agreed that Hungary should not join a multinational peace-keeping force in Albania , the Hungarian MTI news agency reported . 
&quot; Considering the circumstances I took the view that the government should not meet Italy &apos;s request that Hungarian soldiers should take part in the deployment in Albania , &quot; Horn told a news conference . 
Horn said the Italian government had asked Hungary to send a 250-strong contingent to Albania this month to protect humanitarian aid supplies to the troubled country . 
Horn said the reasons for turning down the request were that it had not come from either the European Union nor the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) and that the personal safety of soldiers in the force was not guaranteed . 
he said the decision would not weaken Hungary &apos;s chances of joining NATO nor worsen the country &apos;s traditionally good relations with Italy . 
Hungary had already helped Albania with shipments of clothing and medicines and would continue to send humanitarian aid , he said .
