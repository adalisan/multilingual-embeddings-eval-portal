the New Jersey devils finally scored some goals on Tuesday to help goaltender Martin Brodeur notch his 100th career victory . 
Bobby Holik and Brian Rolston each had a goal and an assist as the devils broke out of their scoring slump for a 4-2 triumph over the Boston Bruins . 
Rolston and Randy McKay tallied 79 seconds apart early in the second period as the devils built a 3-0 lead en route to only their third victory in their last 11 games . 
Brodeur , who backstopped the devils to the Stanley Cup in 1995 , made 21 saves to snap his personal four-game winless string and reach the century milestone in career victories . 
Adam Oates , on a powerplay , and Rob DiMaio scored for the Bruins as Boston pulled within 3-2 . 
but John MacLean &apos;s empty netter with 21 seconds to go put the win in the record books . 
&quot; I think for our team it was great to win this game , &quot; devils coach Jacques Lemaire said . 
&quot; We got a couple of goals at the start that helped us with our confidence . 
in Pittsburgh , Patrick Lalime tied an NHL record for the best start by a rookie goaltender and Jaromir Jagr notched his league-leading 39th and 40th goals as the penguins extended their unbeaten streak to 12 games with a 3-1 victory over the Dallas Stars . 
Lalime stopped 30 shots to improve to 12-0-2 since being recalled from the minors in early December . 
his start equals the mark set by the great Ken Dryden with the 1970-71 Montreal Canadiens , who went on to win the Stanley Cup . 
Joe Nieuwendyk &apos;s powerplay goal was Lalime &apos;s lone blemish . 
Jagr scored with 5 : 27 left in the second period to break a 1-1 deadlock and added an insurance tally early in the third . 
in Philadelphia , Paul Coffey &apos;s goal with 45 seconds left lifted the red-hot flyers to their league-leading 27th win , a 3-2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens . 
Coffey took a pass from Dale Hawerchuk in the slot and blasted a one-timer past Pat Jablonski for the game winner . 
John LeClair and John Druce also scored for the flyers , who are 15-1-4 in their last 20 games . 
Brian savage and Benoit Brunet tied the game for Montreal , which was outshot 35-18 . 
Coffey &apos;s assist on Druce &apos;s goal was the 1,049th of his career , moving him into a tie with Gordie Howe for second place on the all-time list . 
Ron Hextall needed to make only 16 saves to record his 200th victory with the flyers . 
in Detroit , Kevin Stevens scored at 8 : 20 of the third period as the Los Angeles Kings rallied from a two-goal deficit for a 3-3 tie with the Red wings . 
ray Ferraro , who scored the Kings &apos; second goal at 3 : 36 of the third , nearly won it for Los Angeles . 
but Detroit goalie Chris Osgood made a Blocker save on Ferraro &apos;s wrist shot from the top of the crease with one second left in regulation . 
Osgood finished with 26 saves for the wings , who are unbeaten in overtime contests this season at 2-0-8 . 
Brendan Shanahan &apos;s 25th goal , a powerplay tally at 18 : 28 of the second , had given Detroit a 3-1 lead . 
in Vancouver , Alexander Mogilny &apos;s goal 8 : 43 into the third period lifted the Canucks into a 4-4 tie with the Florida panthers . 
Robert Svehla second goal of the game with 14 : 04 left in regulation gave the panthers a 4-3 edge , but Mogilny answered with his 18th of the season , whipping a wrist shot past John Vanbiesbrouck &apos;s right pad . 
Vancouver had a power play for the first 1 : 56 of overtime , but the Canucks were unable to test Vanbiesbrouck . 
Mike Sillinger scored twice for Vancouver , the second on a penalty shot at 5 : 03 of the third that tied the game at 3-3 .
