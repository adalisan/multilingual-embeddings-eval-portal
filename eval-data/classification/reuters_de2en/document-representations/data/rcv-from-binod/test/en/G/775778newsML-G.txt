a U.S. district judge has refused to dismiss a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of thousands of Nicaraguan immigrants who claim the United States has illegally denied them residency . 
U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King , in a ruling issued on Friday but made public on Monday , said his court had jurisdiction over the lawsuit and ordered the government to file an answer to the complaint within 30 days . 
&quot; It &apos;s a big victory . 
it &apos;s without precedent , &quot; said Jose Lagos , spokesman for Nicaraguan Fraternity , a party to the lawsuit . 
&quot; It will allow our lawsuit to go ahead . 
the lawsuit , filed on March 23 , alleged that thousands of Nicaraguans who fled the U.S.-backed contra war in their homeland during their 1980s had been illegally denied resident status , leaving them in immigration limbo while allowing them to work and pay taxes . 
it named as defendants President Bill Clinton , Attorney General Janet Reno and Immigration and Naturalisation Service Commissioner Doris Meissner and claimed class-action status on behalf of 50,000 Nicaraguans , most of them living in Miami . 
the lawsuit represented just one salvo in an ongoing battle between immigrant advocates and the government over amendments to immigration law that took effect April 1 . 
the changes left thousands of refugees from Nicaragua , Guatemala , El Salvador and other countries open to deportation . 
lawyers for Nicaraguan immigrant groups say the legal changes had forced hundreds of Nicaraguans underground , moving from house to house to avoid deportation . 
the suit asked the court to rule that the U.S. government violated the constitutional rights of the refugees and to grant &quot; orderly determination &quot; of their asylum claims . 
King &apos;s ruling came on a motion to dismiss the suit in which the government claimed the court did not have jurisdiction . 
in a separate lawsuit on similar issues , King in June issued a preliminary injunction which prevented the ins from ordering mass deportations . 
he set a trial for Jan . 5 . 
in July , Reno announced a package of initiatives to protect immigrants , including a vow to review a ruling by the Immigration Appeals Board that could have resulted in mass expulsions and legislation to Congress to ease restrictions on immigrants .
