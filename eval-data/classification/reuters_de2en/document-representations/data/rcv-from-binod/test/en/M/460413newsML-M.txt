Finnish shares on Friday ended a four-day losing streak buoyed by firmer bonds and gains on Wall Street , but brokers saw the recent shaky tone prevailing at least until the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s policy meeting next week . 
investors , scared by uncertainty about the start of EMU and by talk that a U.S. interest rate hike may be imminent , remained cautious and the rise in share prices was mainly a recoil to losses earlier this week . 
&quot; This was not necessarily a start of a new rise , it may be a natural correction after a four-day slide , &quot; one broker said . 
Nokia outperformed , rising 1.6 percent to 305.70 markka .
