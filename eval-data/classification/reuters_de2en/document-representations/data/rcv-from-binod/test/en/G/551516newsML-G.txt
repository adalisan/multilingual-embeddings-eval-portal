Defense Secretary William Cohen said on Tuesday the U.S. military still has far too many bases after the Cold War and he expects to decide quickly whether to press Congress for painful new closings . 
the Pentagon has shut down dozens of big bases and hundreds of small facilities at home and abroad in recent years . 
but Cohen said more reductions were needed to match even bigger cuts in U.S. troop strength to 1.4 million . 
&quot; I think it has been clear for some time that there is an excess capacity of infrastructure , &quot; he said when asked by reporters if he would call for base closings in a major new defense strategy report to be sent to Congress by May 15 . 
he said he had made no final decisions on arms programs or further troop cuts in the Quadrennial Defense Review but noted that troop strength had already been cut by 33 percent while bases had been cut by only 18 percent . 
&quot; That leaves a fairly significant excess capacity which has to be addressed . 
whether or not it comes in the form of a BRAC ( base realignment and closing ) or some other process is something we intend to discuss in the next several days . 
Cohen spoke to reporters at a photo opportunity with visiting Romanian Defense Minister Victor Babiuc . 
at stake in the quadrennial review are arms including billions of dollars in new fighter jets planned by big defense contractors and possibly tens of thousands of civilian jobs at and around bases that might be closed . 
in four previous rounds of base-closings , the Pentagon has closed or realigned 97 major installations in the United States . 
it can close bases overseas on its own but needs congressional approval for the explosive political process of doing so at home . 
&quot; With respect to the QDR , no decisions have been made at this point , &quot; Cohen stressed on Tuesday . 
&quot; The stories that you &apos;ve read about are speculative in nature . 
he said he had not decided whether additional troop cuts would be made to help pay for expensive arms modernization as the Pentagon works on the strategy and force report , which Cohen will discuss with President Bill Clinton in coming days . 
the New York Times said on Tuesday that the Army could be further cut by 50,000 troops to a strength of 445,000 . 
but one senior defense official , who asked not to be identified , sharply challenged that figure . 
&quot; We are not contemplating such dramatic cuts , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; The secretary hopes to accomplish major savings for modernization with efficiency such as inventory cuts , private contracting of some military services and some cuts in weapons and force structures . 
a major stake in the deliberations includes whether the Pentagon will buy as many as 4,400 new attack jets in three planned programs at a cost of more than $ 300 billion . 
they include the Air Force F-22 &quot; stealth &quot; jet , the military &apos;s Joint Strike Fighter and the Navy &apos;s advanced FA-18E / F. 
one senior defense official said he did not expect Cohen to cancel any of the three but the number of planned aircraft could be cut . 
Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. are competing to build up to 3,000 Joint Strike fighters for more than $ 170 billion in the next century . 
variations of the jet would go to the Air Force , Navy , marines and British Royal Navy . 
Lockheed Martin is also developing the F-22 . 
the Air Force wants to buy about 400 in the next century at a currently estimated cost of $ 67 billion . 
the FA-18E / F , built by McDonnell Douglas Corp .. is already undergoing flight testing and the Navy wants to buy 1,000 of them by 2015 at a cost of about $ 80 billion .
