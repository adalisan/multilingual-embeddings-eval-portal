Polish shares fell for the fourth consecutive session but analysts said a brief rebound was possible , spurred by expectations of good companies &apos; October earnings , most of them due on Monday . 
&quot; We will have a brief rebound - one or two sessions as some short-term investors have already started speculating before releasing the earnings reports , &quot; said Pawel Tarnowski , an analyst at Reiffeisen Capital and Investment Polska . 
some said Thursday &apos;s vote in the upper house of parliament on 1997 taxes , amending the lower house &apos;s bill which was seen as inflationary , could also bring some optimism to the market . 
but they said the good signal in the form of the amendment introducing moderately lower income taxes for everyone , instead of a deep cut only for the most needy , could yet be spoiled by the rejection of the bill by the lower house or the president . 
the main market &apos;s WIG index fell 1.1 percent , to 13,392.1 , and turnover rose 16.9 percent to 84.2 million zlotys on both markets as 50 issues fell , 14 rose and 16 were flat .
