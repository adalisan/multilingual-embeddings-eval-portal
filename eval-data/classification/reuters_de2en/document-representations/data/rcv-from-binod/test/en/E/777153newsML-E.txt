following are economists &apos; views on German industrial production data for June , which showed a 1.4 percent increase in nationwide output from the month before . 
West German output was up 0.4 percent from the previous month , while east German production rose 0.5 percent . 
&quot; The headline figure is pretty much in line with the consensus . 
&quot; There may always be a discrepancy between ( the national figure and the regional breakdown . 
the national figure does not have to be the weighted average of ( west and east ) because the national weights are different . 
the industrial output data are &quot; in line with the overall consensus on GDP growth for the year , which is 2-2.25 percent . 
industrial production is &quot; running ahead a little bit because production is mainly export driven , while producer goods are imported . 
Holger Schmieding , Merrill Lynch , Frankfurt : 
&quot; The ( industrial production ) data look very good , roughly as expected . 
the economy is in the middle of a very nice upswing . 
&quot; We expect to see GDP growth of 0.8 percent in the second quarter from the previous quarter and roughly the same rate for the remaining quarters of the year . 
&quot; With record low interest rates , we can see that the Bundesbank has stimulated the economy extraordinarily and , if the dollar remains strong , it will have to rethink its position . 
&quot; If the dollar goes over 1.87 marks , it could raise rates this month and if not it could wait until September or October . 
&quot; It &apos;s in line with expectations , if not a touch above , and with a noticeable upward revision expected it &apos;s going to be somewhat more clearly above market expectations . 
&quot; It &apos;s a bounceback related to the ( weakness of ) the currency , which should continue to drive things along quite strongly in the coming months . 
&quot; Construction was strong , up six percent , but is volatile . 
he said he expects second quarter GDP to come in at 0.7 to 0.8 percent , with growth of 2.2 percent for 1997 as a whole . 
he said he saw no risks of a weak mark generating inflation , although the Bundesbank might move on interest rates to defend the mark if it nears 1.90 to the U.S. dollar . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think there &apos;s any inflationary threat out there and the domestic side of the economy is very flat ... They may well do something if the mark continues to fall at this rate . 
but I don &apos;t think it will serve to turn the currency around .
