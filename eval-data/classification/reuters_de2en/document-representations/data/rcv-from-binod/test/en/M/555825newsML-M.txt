CSCE coffee futures were mainly lower in relatively stable dealings ahead of midday after a dizzying morning which saw benchmark July peak at a new life-of-contract high then plummet over 11.00 cents per lb in the first half hour of trading . 
the downturn was viewed as a technical correction to the market &apos;s recent stunning rally , traders said , helped by the near completion of roaster price-fixing against May and the return of origin activity after the May Day holiday on Thursday . 
&quot; It is a correction , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; But it is also down because roaster are finishing fixation against May and origin are coming back and selling after the holiday . 
at 1131 est , July coffee slumped 8.15 cents a lb , to 214.75 cents , after ranging widely from a new lifetime high of 225.00 to 211.50 . 
spot May was down 5.75 cents , to 247.00 , while the back months traded 6.40 lower to 3.60 higher . 
the market headed into positive territory from the outset , defying pre-opening expectations , as speculators followed through on Thursday &apos;s sharply higher close after a further drawdown in exchange stockpiles . 
after Thursday &apos;s close , the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks fell by 4,000 bags , to 43,668 bags as of April 30 . 
there were 7,227 bags of coffee pending grading , the exchange said . 
but the July contract &apos;s ability to rebuff a test of chart resistance at 225.00 cents and fears the market was well overbought , sparked waves of speculative liquidation , traders said . 
&quot; The market went up 30 cents in four days and it was overdue for a correction , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; It &apos;s shaken up the confidence of some longs and got them ready to take profits . 
technically , traders pegged near-term support was at the day &apos;s low of 211.50 basis July and said a breach of that level could lead to a test of 203.00 .
