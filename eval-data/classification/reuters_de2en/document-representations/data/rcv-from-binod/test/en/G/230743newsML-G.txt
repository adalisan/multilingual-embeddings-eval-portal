four U.S. congressmen on a fact-finding visit to the former Yugoslavia on Tuesday joined a huge rally in Belgrade mounted by Serbian opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic . 
they walked with 50,000 demonstrators and later waved their support to the crowd gathered for a rally in a central Belgrade square from a window of the opposition headquarters building . 
the delegation leader , Democrat Nick Rahall , said the four were on a fact-finding tour of the former Yugoslav states , including Serbia , Montenegro , Bosnia and Croatia , in particular seeing the role U.S. troops have played in Bosnian peacekeeping . 
Rahall , of West Virginia , who is accompanied by Democrat Stanford Bishop from Georgia and Republicans Bob Ney of Oklahoma and Jim Bunn of Oregon , said the visit had coincided with the Belgrade protests . 
&quot; We are here at a very opportune time to show the Serbian people that the U.S. congress , the American people are for democratic rights , human rights , &quot; Rahall said . 
Belgrade has been shaken by protests since the government annulled an opposition victory in local polls on November 17 . 
demonstrators demand an end to Milosevic &apos;s nine-year rule . 
the United States has warned Serbia it would react with outrage against any use of force against protesters Washington says are demonstrating peacefully . 
the opposition Zajedno coalition invited the U.S. visitors to join one of the marches that have jammed the city streets . 
the protesters passed the offices of independent Radio B-92 which President Milosevic had closed earlier in the day . 
&quot; The U.S. has a moral obligation to do what it can to protect the freedom of the press , &quot; said Rahall . 
&quot; We are obviously concerned by this and we will discuss the issue with our colleagues back in Washington . 
the congressmen planned to go to neighbouring Montenegro on Tuesday night and fly to Zagreb and Sarajevo later in the week .
