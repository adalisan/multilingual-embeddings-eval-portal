top prices next week could range from $ 70.00 to $ 71.00 , with support expected from ideas that beef demand will improve . 
beef movement was strong Thursday , but packers continued to discount prices to get the product sold , market sources said . 
beef prices Thursday were quoted down $ 0.82 to $ 1.03 per cwt , with 307 fabricated loads sold , according to USDA . 
choice heavyweight cuts were quoted down $ 1.03 at $ 106.37 , down $ 1.51 for the week to date Thursday .

the report is expected to show that supplies of cattle on feed rose during September but remained below year-ago levels .
