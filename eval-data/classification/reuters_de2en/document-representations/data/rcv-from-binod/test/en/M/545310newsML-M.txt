Taiwan &apos;s money rates softened at mid-session on Monday on slightly easing liquidity in the banking system , dealers said . 
at midday , the overnight interbank rate was at 6.351 percent against Saturday &apos;s 6.362 close -- still far outside the central bank &apos;s 5.00-5.5 percent target zone -- with 30-day commercial paper down to 6.35-6.40 against 6.40-6.45 . 
the money rates were likely to stay around the current levels , but dealers said money demand would gradually increase before Thursday &apos;s Labour Day holiday and the beginning of the routine monthly payroll period . 
the bond market did not report any trade in the morning session . 
the late morning announcement of Taiwan &apos;s index of leading business indicators , which rose for the seventh consecutive month in March , dampened buying interest , brokers said . 
investors feared that the indicators , which forecast peaks and troughs in the business cycle , showed Taiwan &apos;s economy is overheated .
