Indian Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda was quoted on Saturday as saying it may take some time for the government to create a &quot; congenial atmosphere &quot; for raising petroleum prices . 
&quot; As things stand now , there will be a gap of about 200 billion rupees in the oil pool account by the end of March , &quot; Business Today magazine quoted DEVE Gowda as saying . 
the oil pool deficit is the amount which the government owes domestic oil companies for selling petroleum products in the domestic market at prices well below international levels . 
the latest government estimate , released last month , forecast that the oil pool deficit would reach 155 billion rupees at the end of March . 
DEVE Gowda did not explain the difference between the two projections . 
&quot; This is one of the major problems that we are facing since the price of crude oil has gone up in the international market , &quot; DEVE Gowda said . 
the prime minister said former finance minister Manmohan Singh , a member of the Congress party which supports DEVE Gowda &apos;s 15-party coalition , had said an increase in the administered prices of petroleum products was necessary . 
&quot; But I would like to say that the government must also explain the circumstances to the people , how resources have to be mobilised and that , otherwise , there will be a scarcity , &quot; DEVE Gowda said . 
&quot; So , we must create a congenial atmosphere for a price hike , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That may take a little time .
