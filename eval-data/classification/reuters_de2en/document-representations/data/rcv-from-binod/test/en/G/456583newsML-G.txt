U.S. and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin get down to the serious business of world problems on Friday after a jovial start to their summit talks in the Finnish capital . 
they were due to meet at 0800 GMT to discuss issues affecting world peace after an evening which normally sober Kremlin and White House spokesmen described in gushing tones as full of banter and wisecracks . 
&quot; The president and Yeltsin were clearly striking a tone for the meeting which seemed to be very positive . 
there was a lot of banter back and forth , &quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry said after the two leaders dined with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari on Thursday . 
&quot; There were lots of jokes , including jokes about health , &quot; Russian presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a separate briefing . 
Clinton is temporarily confined to a wheelchair after surgery for a leg injury and Yeltsin has only just emerged from months of illness following a heart operation . 
the 66-year-old Kremlin chief looked well , although stiff and somewhat drawn , clearly still recovering his health . 
McCurry said the two presidents did not attempt to get into serious negotiations over dinner , but would do so at the main talks which are scheduled to end with a joint news conference at 1645 GMT . 
they will meet at Ahtisaari &apos;s official residence , a modern , airy villa overlooking the Baltic and McCurry quoted Clinton as saying of Yeltsin : &quot; I think he really came here to do business . 
Yeltsin and Clinton have to tackle the thorny subject of NATO &apos;s plans to expand eastwards , an issue that raised Russian ire in the days preceeding the summit . 
Yastrzhembsky has said Yeltsin will defend Moscow &apos;s interests &quot; like never before &quot; and U.S. insistence on taking former Soviet bloc countries into NATO could force Russia to review its foreign policy and strengthen links with countries like China , India and Iran . 
Russia says NATO &apos;s expansion plans , a first phase of which would probably see Poland , Hungary and The Czech Republic join , threaten its security , undermine Yeltsin , create new divisions in Europe and represent a breach of trust . 
Clinton hopes to reassure Yeltsin that NATO enlargement presents no threat and will spread security . 
U.S. officials said they would also press Russia to ratify within the next few weeks a long-delayed 1993 arms agreement cutting long-range nuclear missiles . 
they will also discuss Russia &apos;s troubled transition to a market economy .
