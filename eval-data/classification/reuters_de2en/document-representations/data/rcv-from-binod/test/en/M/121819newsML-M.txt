* New Zealand close firmer but off highs 
* Reserve Bank takes shine off rally 
* smaller companies index outperforms 
new Zealand share prices edged higher after hitting a fresh 32-month peak , but brokers said the Reserve Bank &apos;s warning shot helped take the shine off the rally . 
the NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 4.32 points higher at 2,325.98 but was off its peak of 2,333.75 after the Reserve Bank said there was no scope for an easing after Tuesday &apos;s better-than-expected inflation data . 
&quot; The brakes were put on the equities market by the statement that there would be no room for further easing , &quot; Tim Koller at Hendry Hay McIntosh said . 
but the fact that Telecom , after its record-breaking run , gave up only one cent to NZ $ 7.31 said much about the market and its inherent support . 
the Small Companies Index was again very strong , firming 50.95 points to 4,631.97 , bringing its rise to 3.5 percent over the past two days . 
Koller said that reflected an appetite for value stocks . 
outside the top five , Independent Newspapers firmed 30 points to NZ $ 6.50 and Waste Management gained 25 to $ 5.75 . 
&quot; Overall the market is very well underpinned and the Small Companies Index being up another percent today just shows the strength of the broader market , &quot; Koller said .
