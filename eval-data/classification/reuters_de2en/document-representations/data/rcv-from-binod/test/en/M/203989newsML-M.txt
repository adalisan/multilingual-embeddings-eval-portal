NWE naphtha prices edged higher on Wednesday after crude oil rallied and traders debated whether the arbitrage to the U.S. was now open , and whether that was bullish for European prices . 
but the NWE market was still seen relatively balanced for the rest of the month with end-users comfortable and two Russian cargoes of about 8,000-10,000 tonnes expected to arrive . 
&quot; buyers are still fairly relaxed and comfortable about supply . 
a 35,000 tonne Greek cargo was confirmed sold this week at $ 232- $ 233 for delivery to Houston by the end of the month . 
that prompted talk that the arbitrage was open and further supplies may be drained to the U.S. 
but one trader said he did not think the arbitrage was &quot; fully open &quot; to ship cargoes across the Atlantic for a profit , and the Greek cargo may have been sent to the U.S. because it could not be sold in NWE . 
&quot; It &apos;s rather dangerous at the moment to speculate on the window , &quot; he said . 
he said the spread between the U.S. and Rotterdam has to be about $ 5- $ 7 to make money on the arbitrage , and it did not appear to be that wide at the moment . 
he was also watching the U.S. spot propane market where prices rallied on Tuesday on the back of forecasts for below-normal temperatures in many U.S. regions . 
&quot; It &apos;s up and down and it was open yesterday and we will have to wait and see for today , &quot; a broker said . 
DEC swaps rose $ 3 to $ 223 / $ 224 with Jan $ 6 behind at $ 217 / $ 218 and Feb $ 5.50 backwardated to Jan at $ 211.50 / $ 212.50 . 
cargoes were seen at $ 226 / $ 228 CIF .
