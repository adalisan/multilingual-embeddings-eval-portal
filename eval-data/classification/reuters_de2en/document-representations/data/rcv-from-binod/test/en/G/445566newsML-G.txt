the body of Ali Shika was carried on Sunday through the streets of Durres by Albanian police weeping openly at the death of their comrade . 
&quot; This man never hurt anyone and now he is dead , &quot; said one of his comrades . 
&quot; Where is the justice in that ? 
automobiles pulled to the curb and pedestrians in this port city fell silent as the funeral procession passed . 
some secret police in civilian clothes got out of their cars carrying Kalashnikovs and joined the mourners on foot . 
&quot; May God cut the hands off the man who did this , &quot; said an elderly woman standing on the sidewalk as the body passed . 
Ali Shika was 30 when he was killed on Saturday afternoon . 
police said he had stopped a vehicle and asked to search it when the driver pulled out a gun and shot him . 
the sight of a dead policeman borne on an army stretcher caused the residents of this city to pause and reflect about the future of their city and their country . 
despite the unrest in Albania following the collapse of five pyramid schemes , which wiped out the life-savings of tens of thousands of families , Durres remained firmly under government control until Thursday . 
that day the country &apos;s largest port teetered on the verge of anarchy as shooting and looting erupted in parts of the city . 
since then the police have regained control . 
residents have been given a second chance to ask themselves if they want to go the way of southern Albania , where police and army units have collapsed or withdrawn and local citizens &apos; committees share control with clan-based mafia organisations . 
Ali Shika &apos;s procession , grown to about 100 strong , halted in a square by the city &apos;s main mosque and in front of its main administrative building . 
scores of city workers watched impassively from the building &apos;s windows and front steps . 
the police formed up and fired a thunderous volley into the air from their Kalashnikovs as a salute to their dead colleague -- a gesture that made up in noise what it lacked in finesse . 
empty shell casings rained down like brass confetti . 
one policeman shouted to the city workers : &quot; Don &apos;t stand there watching us . 
get out here . 
this man died for you too . 
sheepishly , those on the steps walked over , warily eyeing the police and their guns . 
the crowd moved across the square to the steps of the Mayor &apos;s office where policemen , many choking with tears , praised the dead man and cursed the mafia they say killed him . 
&quot; We are the police and we do not need anyone to join us , &quot; one of the men declared from the steps . 
&quot; We will save the city and destroy the mafia . 
murmurs swept through the crowd of several hundred townspeople now standing on the Plaza at the bottom of the steps . 
one civilian blared out : &quot; Long live the police , long live Durres &quot; and began applauding the officers . 
the crowd joined in and then the police begin applauding as well and finally the procession wound away through the dusty streets .
