the Australian share market ended just lower on Wednesday after a day of lacklustre trade with little impact from Tuesday &apos;s Federal government budget . 
the All Ordinaries index lost 3.9 points to 2,530.4 . 
brokers said the market had seen moderate two-way business with little specific to be gleaned for the broader equity market from the 1997 / 98 fiscal programme . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think our market has drawn very much from the budget , &quot; said Derek Bond , director of Brisbane-based brokerage , Burrell and Co . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a fairly lacklustre day in all . 
the market is just going about its business . 
the main focus in the market was the Westpac result . 
Westpac Banking Corporation did indeed feature , as did its other &quot; Big Four &quot; colleagues , Commonwealth Bank , National Australia Bank and ANZ Bank in a day of choppy , volatile trade for the sector . 
those pricing levels looked expensive for many , though , and sellers quickly took the opportunity to cash in . 
Westpac shares jumped 10 cents an intraday high of A $ 7.60 after the result , but by the end of the day were down five cents at A $ 7.45 as traders decided better value lay elsewhere . 
media giant News Corp lost most ground among the large capitalisation stocks . 
its shares dived over 3.5 percent to A $ 5.72 with traders unhappy about talk of further acquisitions . 
featuring was the the long-rumoured US $ 1 billion deal with U.S.-based International Family entertainment and talk of New &apos;s FoxSports division buying the Los Angeles dodgers baseball franchise for over US $ 350 million . 
gold miner Newcrest Mining Ltd made back some of its recent substantial losses , jumping nine percent to an intraday high of A $ 3.52 after managing director John Quinn resigned . 
&quot; Newcrest was the star performer in the gold sector . 
the market took the change of management in its stride , &quot; Bond said . 
shares in investment house Macquarie Bank dived nearly three percent to an intraday low of A $ 9.28 amid fears a budget crackdown on trade in dividend franking credits would harm its equities business . 
the shares recovered some ground in the afternoon to close 10 cents lower at A $ 9.44 . 
falls slightly outnumbered rises , while about 32 percent of stocks traded remained steady .
