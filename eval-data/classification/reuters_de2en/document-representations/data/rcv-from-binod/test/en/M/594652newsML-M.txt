Argentine bonds were flat late morning Monday as the market tread water ahead of Tuesday &apos;s policy-setting meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) . 
&quot; There is nothing going on today , &quot; said a trader at a local bank . 
Argentina &apos;s FRB Brady bond due 2005 was unchanged at 92-3 / 8 , while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 4 due 2002 was up flat at 115.05 . 
another trader said the market had largely discounted a 25-basis point hike in the U.S. Federal funds rate . 
he added that he anticipated a small rally in prices if the Federal Reserve leaves rates unchanged .
