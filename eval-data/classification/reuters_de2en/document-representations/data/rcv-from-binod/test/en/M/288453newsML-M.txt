Argentine stocks tracked Wall Street closely Monday , giving back some early gains to close moderately higher , dealers said . 
&quot; The market outlook remains good , but overall caution prevails , &quot; said Miguel Daneri at Boston Securities , predicting a hesitant trading climate Tuesday . 
the blue-chip MerVal index slipped off a session high of 662.03 to close at 656.98 with a 0.8 percent gain . 
traders noted a rise in U.S. long bond yields to 6.78 percent from 6.73 showed the 30-year treasury bond had changed course and knocked down support levels . 
&quot; We can now expect a U.S. yield closer to 7.0 percent than the recent floor of 6.3 percent , &quot; said Daneri . 
&quot; Nevertheless the Bolsa is keeping its firm tone and because there are few sellers , the AFJPs ( private pension funds ) are willing to snap up good bargains . 
analysts noted expectations surrounding a $ 2.0 billion local government bond issue was also underpinning the Bolsa . 
details of the placement will be revealed Wednesday . 
still , &quot; the overiding factor for investors will be how Wall Street reacts to key economic indicators towards the end of the week , &quot; said another trader . 
Bolsa floor volume recovered to 21.8 million pesos from Friday &apos;s weak tally of 15 million , while over-the-counter deals totaled 64.7 million against 63.8 million Friday . 
the broad market added 0.4 percent , with winners pounding losers 44 to eight and 17 issues closing flat . 
top main-tier risers were textil firm Alpargatas , holding firm Comercial del Plata and pulp maker Celulosa , up 2.4 percent , 2.0 percent and 1.9 percent , respectively . 
petrochemical firm Indupa faced the biggest loss of 0.9 percent , followed by holding company Perez Companc and utility Central Costanera , both off 0.3 percent .
