a U.S. wheat official urged Asian buyers on Monday to buy their soft white wheat supplies before prices head up if Pakistan steps into the market . 
Tom Mick , the chief executive officer of the Washington Wheat Commission , told a wheat conference in Singapore that soft white wheat prices may rise if Pakistan begins its buying programme . 
&quot; The key factor you should be watching now is Pakistan , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Prices should strengthen &quot; if Pakistani buyers came into the market . 
some 90 percent of U.S. white wheat is sold in Asia , Mick added . 
Pakistan is the leading buyer of U.S. soft white wheat followed by Japan , the Philippines and South Korea . 
Mick said production this year of soft white , planted mainly in Washington , Idaho and parts of Oregon , should reach 7.9 million tonnes in the 1996 / 97 ( June / May ) marketing year . 
output in 1995 / 96 reached 8.9 million tonnes . 
&quot; We will have , for the seventh year in a row , a fantastic crop , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This is an ideal time to buy your white wheat . 
but some dealers expressed doubts whether Pakistan could begin their buying programme immediately . 
&quot; In a word , the Pakistanis are a little short on money . 
they &apos;ll have to sort that out first , &quot; one dealer said .
