Australian Foreign Minister Alexander downer , playing down an acrimonious race and immigration debate at home , spoke warmly on Friday of Canberra &apos;s engagement with Asia . 
addressing Australian business executives in Vietnam , downer took a swipe at race row politician Pauline Hanson , saying her policies would condemn Australia to moral , political and economic isolation . 
&quot; We need to develop strong relations with our regional neighbours , &quot; he said . 
&quot; And for any Australian government ever to contemplate the policies that Pauline Hanson puts forward , which are policies -- amongst other things -- of racial discrimination , that government would condemn Australia to total isolation ... &quot; 
a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official said last month that the foreign service had been ordered to counter Hanson at every chance and spread information discrediting her . 
downer , peppering his speech with references to the controversial member of parliament , did just that . 
he said she was deeply unpopular at home , with 94-96 percent of Australians totally rejecting &quot; the sort of inward-looking , insular , out-of-date and quite frankly unacceptable type of Australian that she envisages &quot; . 
Hanson says Australia is in danger of being swamped by Asian immigrants , wants all immigration halted and objects to foreign investment . 
downer focused in his speech on the need for Australia to engage Asian countries in dialogue on regional security and promote trade and investment . 
turning to relations with Vietnam , where he met Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam on Wednesday and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet the next day , downer said they were &quot; little short of an extraordinary thing &quot; . 
Australia is one of Hanoi &apos;s top aid donors , pledging more than $ 200 million since 1993 , and with bilateral trade at some $ 600 million last year it is a key trading partner . 
Australia currently ranks 12th among foreign investors in Vietnam , and downer promised that investments now in the pipeline would take it higher in the pecking order soon . 
the minister will formally open Canberra &apos;s new embassy in Hanoi on Saturday and attend the ground-breaking ceremony for an Australian aid-funded bridge over the Mekong Delta in the south of the country on Sunday . 
Canberra came under pressure from Hanoi last year over a decision to review the former Labor administration &apos;s promise of two-thirds funding for the A $ 83 million ( $ 62.42 million ) My Thuan bridge . 
after months of doubt and wrangling , downer announced during a visit to Hanoi exactly a year ago that the project would proceed .
