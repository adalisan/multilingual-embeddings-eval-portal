a resurgent New Zealand cricket team on Tuesday dashed England &apos;s hopes of a one-day series victory , bowling the tourists out for 200 after setting them 229 to win the fifth and decisive game . 
the win means the kiwis salvage a 2-2 draw in the five-match one-day series after England won the first two games and the third was tied in Napier last Wednesday . 
&quot; The team showed a lot of guts to come through what has been a difficult period , &quot; New Zealand captain Lee Germon said after the game . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ve come a long way to resurrecting the season . 
set 229 to win the match , England got away to a promising start . 
Paceman Geoff Allott clean bowled Mike Atherton with the third ball of the innings , but the England skipper was saved by a dubious no ball call from umpire Evan Watkin . 
television replays clearly showed Allott &apos;s foot was not fully over the no-ball line . 
but England &apos;s good fortune was short-lived . 
Allott soon had the prized wicket of Alec Stewart , who smashed a full toss straight to mid-on when he was on 18 . 
Atherton made the most of his reprieve , stroking 43 runs in effortless fashion until some sharp fielding saw him run out by keeper Lee Germon . 
after Chris Harris enticed Nasser Hussain out of his crease to have him stumped by Germon for 20 , England &apos;s hopes rested with Graham Thorpe . 
the gritty left-hander came to the party , punishing anything loose to progress rapidly into the 30s . 
but persistent pressure form the New Zealand field saw wickets fall regularly at the other end . 
Spinner Dipak Patel bowled Chris Silverwood for 4 , Gavin Larsen had John Crawley lbw for 11 , and Jack Russell , making his first appearance in the one-day series here , nicked a Nathan Astle ball to be cuaght behind for just two . 
Craig White fell to Astle two balls later without scoring and when Robert Croft was run out for two , their chances of pulling off the win were remote . 
Thorpe &apos;s innings came to an end when he was stumped by Germon off Larsen for 55 . 
his half-century had come in 83 balls with two boundaries . 
Gough was the last man out , caught on the cover fence for 16 in the 47th over . 
England assistant coach John Emburey paid tribute to the New Zealand bowling attack , in which medium-pacers Larsen and Harris were again the most restrictive . 
&quot; They really started to put the screws on and put the players under pressure . 
we made a few mistakes and started to get behind the clock , &quot; Emburey said . 
new Zealand were able to post a defendable 228 after a dashing 94 from Astle . 
his sterling knock and two wickets earned him the man of the match award . 
England comprehensively beat the kiwis 2-0 in the three test matches in February and cruised almost effortlessly to a 2-0 lead in the five-match one-day series . 
with their backs to the wall and mounting public frustration over the poor results , New Zealand revitalised their game . 
they tied the third match and won the last two in dramatic fashion to secure the 2-2 series draw and regain some lost pride . 
they now face Sri Lanka in the first of two tests starting in Dunedin on Friday .
