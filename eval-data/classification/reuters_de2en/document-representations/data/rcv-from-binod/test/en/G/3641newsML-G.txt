drug use among teenagers jumped 78 percent from 1992 to 1995 , a federal study said Tuesday , prompting Republican charges that the Clinton administration was losing the war on teenage drug use . 
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole , campaigning in Louisville , Kentucky , called the report &apos;s findings &quot; nothing short of a national tragedy &quot; and said he would make the war on drugs &quot; priority No . 
1 once again . 
&quot; The statistics confirm an upward spiral of drug abuse across the nation since President Clinton took office , &quot; Sen. Orrin Hatch , a Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee , said in a letter to the White House . 
hatch released a summary of the Health and Human Services Department &apos;s 1995 National household Survey on Drug Abuse . 
it showed that while overall drug use figures were fairly stable , youth drug use rose 78 percent between 1992 and 1995 -- 24 percent from 1994 to 1995 alone . 
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the report was cause for concern but administration efforts to curb drug imports were on the right track . 
the HHS report said 10.4 percent of youths aged 12 to 17 used drugs on a monthly basis . 
marijuana use was up 105 percent in 1995 from 1992 and up 37 percent between 1994 and 1995 . 
use of LSD and other hallucinogens jumped 183 percent since 1992 and 54 percent from 1994 to 1995 , while monthly use of cocaine soared 166 percent just in 1994-95 . 
in a letter to Gen. Barry McCaffrey , who heads White House drug control efforts , Hatch said : &quot; I find this data ... very disturbing . 
the data clearly reflects a continuing trend of increased drug abuse throughout the United States . 
HHS officials declined to comment or confirm Hatch &apos;s figures before the report &apos;s scheduled release time on Tuesday . 
but McCurry said , &quot; The figures related to drug use among young people are obviously of great concern , and that &apos;s why we have a strategy to deal with that . 
he said he believed the administration &apos;s strategy to fight drugs was on the right track . 
&quot; We think it &apos;s the right strategy to control use , to control imports , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Above all , this has to be a bipartisan effort that all join into , &quot; he added . 
&quot; One thing we can &apos;t do is to turn drug use among young people into a political football because it sends the wrong message to kids -- then they &apos;ll just think it &apos;s just an issue for the politicians and not something that they have to take responsibility for . 
the summary of another HHS study released by Hatch showed the number of hospital emergency room admissions stemming from marijuana use rose 96 percent between 1992 and 1995 and rose 17 percent between 1994 and 1995 . 
emergency room admissions related to heroine use rose 58 percent from 1992 to 1995 and 19 percent in 1994-95 . 
that study -- the Drug Abuse Warning Network -- monitors numbers and patterns of drug-related emergencies and deaths in 21 metropolitan areas across the country . 
Jim Copple , president of the Community anti-drug Coalitions of America , said blame should be shared by Republicans and Democrats for cutting funds for drug control programmes and losing interest in the issue . 
&quot; I think over the last four or five years , the drug issue itself has fallen off the national radar screen , &quot; he said . 
he criticised the entertainment industry for &quot; starting to glamorize drug use once again &quot; and had a harsh word for parents as well . 
&quot; fifty-seven percent of baby-boomer parents who are now raising adolescents used drugs themselves , even though 75 percent of them clearly don &apos;t want their kids using drugs , &quot; Copple said .
