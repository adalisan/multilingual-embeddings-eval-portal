European stocks shrugged off a positive start by Wall Street on Monday and remained in the minus column , depressed by uncertainty over interest rates . 
on currency markets , the dollar , which weakened last week after a strong run , fell further with traders predicting little in U.S. economic data due this week to re-ignite the rally . 
in London , Europe &apos;s biggest bourse , shares slipped 0.2 percent . 
traders said the market , already well below October &apos;s record levels , could come under more pressure from worries about rising interest rates . 
&quot; London is painting itself into a corner with these worries about domestic interest rates , &quot; said one . 
London &apos;s gloom was not helped by October &apos;s producer price figures although analysts said they showed little underlying inflation pressure . 
investors were largely preoccupied with domestic inflation and interest rate worries , traders said , ignoring Wall Street , which climbed quickly by 0.3 percent when it opened . 
&quot; The prospect of further interest rate rises , fears of a politically-motivated Budget , and the impact of strong sterling on international earners are all likely to hinder performance for the next few weeks . 
&quot; said Ian Williams , strategist at Panmure Gordon . 
investors , already unsettled by a surprise quarter-point rate rise earlier this month , were further rattled on Monday when Bank of England Governor Eddie George repeated that further British rate rises would probably be necessary . 
some analysts said the jitters over interest rates and inflation were overdone . 
they saw the market mood improving once it was clear that 1997 would offer better growth with continued low inflation . 
&quot; The rating on the market is not terribly demanding and I don &apos;t see the need to be so worried , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Not all interest rate increases are bad for equities . 
in Frankfurt , floor trading ended down 0.4 percent in thin trading as investors took profits from Friday &apos;s record highs . 
the Dax index , closed at 2728.32 points down 11.51 , with the weaker dollar depressing the market . 
the Paris bourse was closed for a national holiday commemorating the end of World War One . 
the dollar drifted further down against the yen and the mark by mid-session . 
currency traders were awaiting Japanese indicators due on Tuesday and U.S. figures late in the week . 
&quot; The yen is likely to continue to push upwards ahead of the machinery orders data out tomorrow and the EPA &apos;s ( Economic Planning Agency ) report , &quot; said Julian Fisher , economist at Daiwa Europe . 
&quot; If both point to a continued economic recovery and one which is stronger than expected , it will fuel expectations that interest rate policy may be changed , &quot; he added . 
many dealers were also looking to the rate-setting meeting of the Federal Reserve &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) on Wednesday and U.S. retail sales and consumer prices on Thursday for clues on the health of the American economy . 
&quot; We expect the ( U.S. ) economic data to undershoot and there is near universal agreement that the FOMC is not going to raise rates , &quot; said Klaus Baader , senior currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
the dollar was at 1.4985 marks and 111.19 yen , compared with 1.5045 marks and 111.60 yen in late European trade on Friday . 
London - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was 3.6 points lower at 3,907.0 . 
the Paris bourse was closed for the day . 
gold was fixed at $ 379.75 an ounce in the afternoon , compared to $ 378.95 at the close on Friday . 
silver was at $ 4.85 , up four cents .
