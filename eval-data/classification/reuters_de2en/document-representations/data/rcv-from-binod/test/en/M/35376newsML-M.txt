French interest rate futures rallied late on Thursday , wiping out earlier losses , as the franc gained ground against the mark . 
the franc climbed to a high of 3.4224 at 1455 GMT after slipping overnight below its old exchange rate mechanism floor of 3.4305 to 3.4315 per mark . 
traders said the franc was helped initially by talk of Bank of France intervention and then by a slightly stronger dollar and a concerted effort by government officials to calm concerns that French economic weakness would put the Maastricht budget deficit criteria out of reach . 
September and December PIBOR contracts both settled 11 basis points higher , narrowing the spread over the equivalent Euromark contracts . 
&quot; Basically we had a lot of interest in buying PIBOR and potentially selling the long end against Germany , &quot; said a MATIF trader . 
&quot; People think there &apos;s a good chance three-month rates will come up to 3.75 , and generally the smart money &apos;s thinking the curve &apos;s going to steepen whatever . 
however another PIBOR trader at a French brokerage said short covering had driven the rally and that he thought the December contract was now too expensive . 
the initial franc decline was attributed to concerns French economic weakness , in stark contrast to the stronger than expected rise in German Q2 GDP , would put the Maastricht budget deficit criteria out of reach . 
however economists played down concerns that the French economy was sliding into recession while the German economy was growing strongly . 
&quot; I do not think there &apos;s a divergence between the French and German business cycles . 
business surveys tell the same story of a cyclical rebound in the third quarter , &quot; said Eric Chaney , economist at Morgan Stanley in Paris . 
a number of French government officials , including finance minister Jean Arthuis , sought to calm concerns about a divergence between French and Germany growth and repeated that France would meet the deficit criteria in 1997 . 
analysts said the officials statements , coming after central bank intervention earlier on Thursday , had made people reluctant to continue selling the franc . 
&quot; They were basically scared off by the verbal intervention by the French authorities , &quot; said Nick Parsons , foreign exchange strategist at Banque Paribas . 
&quot; It looked like a concerted effort . 
the French bond future settled higher ahead of key August U.S. non-farm payroll figures due at 1230 GMT on Friday which analysts said could determine whether the U.S. Federal Reserve raises rates at its next council meeting on September 24 . 
one trader said the contract would be stuck between 123 and 124 in the absence of a large move in U.S. bond prices one way or the other after the jobs report . 
there was also strong demand for French government bonds at Thursday &apos;s auction . 
the Treasury sold 17.63 billion francs of oats with an overall cover of 3.4 . 
the 8.25 percent 2004 OAT was particularly in demand with a bid to cover ratio of 4.7 . 
Iain Lindsay , senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais , said concerns were waning that tax perks on life assurance policies would be heavily targetted by Prime Minister Alain Juppe when he presents his tax reform plans at 1800 GMT on Thursday . 
&quot; It looks like the targetting of life insurance will be less than feared in June , &quot; said Lindsay . 
he said a number of domestic investors had been holding back from putting funds into the bond market ahead of the tax reform announcements but that they might now be looking to invest . 
French life assurers were large buyers of long-dated oats in the first few months of 1996 .
