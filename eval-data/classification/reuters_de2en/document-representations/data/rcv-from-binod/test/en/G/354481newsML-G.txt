the European Union expressed its pleasure on Tuesday at Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s sudden decision to recognise opposition victories in municipal elections . 
but in a statement issued by the Dutch presidency , the EU continued to insist that the Serbian leader extend the democratic process in Serbia by reforming the electoral system and easing restrictions on the media . 
in the face of marathon pro-democracy demonstations , Milosevic ordered the reinstatement of disputed opposition victories at local elections last November as recommended by an OSCE fact-finding mission last December . 
he asked the Serbian parliament to restore the result . 
&quot; The Presidency is pleased that President Milosevic has announced that he wishes to resolve the crisis with regard to the results of the local elections on the basis of the recommendations of the OSCE-mission , &quot; the Dutch presidency of the EU said in a statement . 
it noted Milosevic &apos;s proposal to adopt a law which would recognise the results of all local elections . 
&quot; The European Union will study the text of the draft law , which is as yet unknown , very carefully , &quot; the presidency said . 
but it said the mission had also referred in a report to a dialogue with the Serbian opposition on further democratisation , particularly revision of the electoral system , and diversity of opinions in the mass media . 
&quot; When insisting on the full implementation of the recommendations , the European Union also refers to this part of the report , &quot; it said . 
Serbia &apos;s opposition had called for a campaign of passive resistance after the autocratic Milosevic ordered his riot police to forcibly break up pro-democracy demonstrations following 77 days of street protests . 
earlier , Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo said he had warned Milosevic against a violent crackdown on peaceful opposition protests in Belgrade . 
&quot; I protested on behalf of the Union via the Dutch ambassador , &quot; he told a European Parliament committee . 
&quot; They seem to be entering a new phase now . 
violence will make everything different . 
but he noted that the 15-nation bloc &apos;s influence on events in Serbia was limited . 
it already had a trade boycott , he said . 
&quot; The option for military intervention is more or less excluded . 
we are looking at political and diplomatic pressure . 
&quot; All we have left is to try to convince , to give moral support where it is needed and to see what we can do with the Americans . 
the European Union said in a statement on Tuesday that it had been &quot; dismayed by the police brutality against demonstrators in Belgrade this weekend , as well as reports of police brutality in other cities earlier last week . 
the 54-nation Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe also bemoaned the violence and called on Milosevic on Tuesday to begin talks with opposition groups . 
it repeated its call for Milosevic to recognise opposition wins in local elections last November and begin talks with the opposition on future democratic reforms , possibly under auspices of the OSCE .
