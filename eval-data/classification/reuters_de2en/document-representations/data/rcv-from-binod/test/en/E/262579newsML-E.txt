the Federal Reserve is expected to decide on Tuesday to hold interest rates steady amid signs that the see-saw U.S. economy is settling down as the year draws to a close , analysts said . 
with growth moderate and inflation quiescent , they said that the U.S. central bank has scant reason to change short-term rates now -- either up or down . 
a survey of 18 top Fed watchers by St. Louis-based consultants macroeconomic Advisers found that none expect the central bank &apos;s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) to alter its credit stance at Tuesday &apos;s meeting . 
fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his fellow policymakers on the FOMC were due to begin their regularly-scheduled review of policy at 9 : 00 a.m. ( 1400 GMT ) . 
in public speeches and private conversations in recent days , U.S. central bank officials have voiced broad satisfaction with the shape of the economy . 
Greenspan earlier this month called inflation &quot; low &quot; although he added that its future course remained uncertain . 
labour markets are tight and unemployment low , raising the risk of stepped-up wage demands . 
but product markets are , in Greenspan &apos;s words , &quot; comfortable , &quot; indicating no shortages that could lead to higher prices . 
&quot; The risks to the economy seem pretty evenly balanced , &quot; one official , who declined to be named , told Reuters . 
that is not the way it looked just a few months ago . 
at that time , the economy was coming off a strong second quarter and seemed on the verge of overheating . 
but since then , growth has slowed -- to an annualized 2 percent in the third quarter from 4.7 percent in the second . 
&quot; After a steamy first half , economic growth is settling down close to Chairman Greenspan &apos;s speed limit of 2.25 percent , &quot; said Sung won Sohn , chief economist for Minneapolis-based Norwest Corp. 
the economic slowdown should allow Fed policymakers to adopt an even-handed policy directive at their meeting on Tuesday . 
that would be a shift from the stance of the late summer and early fall , when the FOMC tilted policy in the direction of higher rates , without actually raising them . 
the central bank has not changed short-term rates since January , when it shaved them by a quarter percentage point to help the economy through a soft patch . 
that brought the federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans down to 5.25 percent and the discount rate the Fed charges the banks to 5 percent . 
but the steady stance does not mean that Fed policymakers , who are paid to worry about the economy , have no concerns . 
with stock prices high and unemployment low , there is a risk that the economy could pick up steam again next year , fanning inflation . 
the strong stock market means investors have more to spend , while the tight labour market points to higher wages and more spending power for workers . 
Greenspan warned this month that the Fed needed to be wary when &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; infected stock and other asset markets because the subsequent crash hurt the economy . 
some of the froth has gone out of the stock market since then , as investors have cashed in part of their profits . 
the Dow Jones industrial average of blue chip shares fell 36.52 points on Monday , continuing a December swoon after a record-breaking run in November .
