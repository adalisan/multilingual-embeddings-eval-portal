the first witness for prosecutors seeking the death penalty for Jesse Timmendequas portrayed him as a calculating murderer who killed 7-year-old Megan Kanka to keep her quiet forever . 
Timmendequas , 36 , was convicted last month of the 1994 attack on the girl , which terrified a community and inspired &quot; Megan &apos;s Laws &quot; around the nation requiring child molesters to register with police when they move into a town . 
psychologist Robert Sadoff , the first prosecution witness in the trial &apos;s penalty phase , testified that Timmendequas &apos; statements to police about how he raped , sodomized and strangled the girl and then hid her body meant he knew what his actions meant . 
&quot; It shows he found a plan that was appropriate to him to leave her body at that time , &quot; Sadoff said under questioning from Assistant Mercer County Prosecutor Kathryn flicker . 
&quot; What I would call it ( is ) that he became frightened of what he had done by touching her and hearing her scream and was afraid he &apos;d be caught and sent to jail . 
Sadoff &apos;s testimony was aimed at rebutting that of defence psychologist John Podboy , who said the twice-convicted child molester panicked and killed Kanka when she began to scream . 
Timmendequas &apos; lawyers , who rested their case Monday , hope they can keep him off death row by portraying his childhood as one filled with sexual and physical abuse that left him mentally ill . 
if not sentenced to die , he would spend his life in prison without parole . 
he would be sentenced to life if only one of the 12 jurors refused to vote for death . 
deliberations are expected to begin this week after the conclusion of testimony . 
Timmendequas and Kanka &apos;s parents , Richard and Maureen Kanka , could testify in the penalty phase .
