Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday praised U.S. cruise missile raids on Iraq as a &quot; bold and responsible action against aggression . 
the right-wing Israeli leader also said during day-long talks with U.S. officials , including President Bill Clinton , that Arabs must recognise that progress toward Middle East peace is a two-way street requiring compromise from them as well as from Israel . 
Netanyahu held separate meetings with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defence Secretary William Perry , and was to meet Clinton at the White House late Monday afternoon . 
&quot; We are witnessing today the realities of life in the Middle East , &quot; the prime minister said during his Pentagon visit . 
&quot; And the United States has taken a bold and responsible action against aggression and one that Israel , of course , fully supports . 
he referred to last week &apos;s U.S. cruise missile strikes at air defences in southern Iraq , prompted by an attack by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein &apos;s forces against Kurds in the north . 
Israel was the target of Iraqi Scud missile attacks during the 1991 Gulf War and Israelis flocked to gas mask distribution centres after last week &apos;s U.S. attacks on Iraq . 
both Perry and Netanyahu stressed that their two countries are cooperating closely on developing an anti-missile defence , and Perry congratulated Israel on a successful recent test of its experimental arrow anti-missile missile . 
opening a meeting with Christopher on Monday morning , Netanyahu said he would discuss ongoing talks with the Palestinians as well as &quot; what we hope will be a resumption of talks with the Syrians . 
it was his second visit to Washington since he was elected in May , a development that further slowed Israel &apos;s already faltering peace process with Syria and the Palestinians . 
his visit comes as events in Iraq have overshadowed , at least temporarily , the Israeli-Arab negotiations . 
but Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said on Sunday that Israel wanted to move ahead with peace talks with the Palestinians . 
Netanyahu held a breakthrough meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last Wednesday , an event Washington pushed for as a way of giving momentum to the peace process . 
before a meeting in London with Levy on Sunday , Christopher pressed Israel for new &quot; concrete steps &quot; to advance Middle East peace after the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting , a theme that U.S. leaders were expected to take up on Monday . 
Netanyahu has stalled on an Israeli promise to redeploy troops in the West Bank town of Hebron , saying he wants to alter the deal to better safeguard about 400 Jewish settlers living amidst 100,000 Palestinians in the heart of the city . 
Palestinian and Israeli officials overseeing implementation of PLO-Israel peace deals met on Monday in the West Bank town of Jericho for the first time since Netanyahu &apos;s election , with Hebron at the top of the Palestinian agenda . 
but talks between Israel and Syria have been deadlocked , with Damascus demanding that Netanyahu adopt the &quot; land-for-peace &quot; principle espoused by Israel &apos;s former Labour government and agree to withdraw from the Golan Heights . 
Christopher said on Sunday that both Israel and Syria were interested in resuming talks , but State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns later said : &quot; I cannot point to any recent progress in that area . 
Netanyahu was to fly to New York on Monday evening for talks on Tuesday with U.S. business and Jewish leaders .
