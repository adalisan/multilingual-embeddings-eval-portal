new Zealand Treasury Secretary Murray Horn said in a letter to Rodney hide , finance spokesman for the Act NZ party , that there had been no fiscal developments which were causing new economic pressures . 
he was commenting on a letter hide sent to Labour Party finance spokesman Michael Cullen in which he said briefings by Treasury and the Reserve Bank for Act made it clear the economy was on a knife edge . 
&quot; I have consulted with the governor ( of the Reserve Bank ) , and I need to point out that this impression is neither the detail nor the tenor of the briefings that we offered , &quot; Horn said in the letter , dated October 29 and made public on Wednesday . 
&quot; Our briefing went through issues since the ( September ) pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update was completed , and showed that little had changed . 
&quot; The Governor similarly went through his September forecasts and outlined developments since that time , &quot; Horn said . 
other reporting of the briefings was not consistent with the idea that they revealed new and disturbing developments , Horn said , citing comments from Act leader Richard Prebble .
