Malaysian rubber prices were higher at noon as the market adjusted again to the weakness of the ringgit against the U.S. dollar , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s still early in the day and we &apos;re hoping to get some inquiries , but otherwise , things are quiet , &quot; said a trader . 
at midday , the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board quoted the RSS1 for September buyer at 249 cents ( 90 U.S. cents ) a kg , up one cent from Tuesday &apos;s close . 
the SMR20 for September buyer was half cent higher at 248 cents a kg . 
traders said prices could rise again in the afternoon if the ringgit remained under pressure . 
the ringgit has fallen nearly 12 percent in value against the dollar in the last month . 
&quot; The currency is the only factor at the moment , &quot; said a trader . 
&quot; There is no real buying . 
at 0400 GMT , the ringgit was at 2.7730 to a dollar in Kuala Lumpur , recovering from the opening an 2.7785 .
