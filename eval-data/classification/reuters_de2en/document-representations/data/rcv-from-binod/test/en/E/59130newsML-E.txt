a leading British business group urged the government on Tuesday not to take risks with the economy for political reasons and said it should not cut taxes or interest rates in the run-up to the general election . 
the British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC ) , the country &apos;s largest business representative body , said maintaining a stable economic environment should be the government &apos;s priority . 
&quot; careful management of the economy must not be driven off course by political expediency in an election year , &quot; BCC president David Richardson said in the organisation &apos;s budget submission . 
&quot; The needs of British business should at all times be put before short-term political gain . 
the BCC said Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) Kenneth Clarke should not cut personal taxes in his November 26 budget , the last before an election must be called , because the budget deficit remained high . 
it was also important that spending on education and transport should be maintained . 
&quot; Furthermore , tax cuts at this point could have inflationary consequences , &quot; the BCC said . 
Clarke should instead reduce the administrative burden on business by cutting &quot; red tape &quot; and refraining from introducing new indirect taxes , while encouraging businesses to invest through appropriate tax measures . 
the organisation , whose members represent more than 196,000 British businesses of all sizes , was equally cautious on interest rates , which Clarke has cut four times since December to their present 5.75 percent level . 
&quot; To reduce interest rates further at present , stimulating what is already improving demand , is a risk which could backfire and stoke inflation , &quot; it said . 
however , raising interest rates at this stage would risk ending the benefits of economic recovery which small firms were only just beginning to feel . 
&quot; We cannot see the evidence for taking either risk at present and believe that rates should remain as they are . 
in the more medium term , interest rates may indeed have to rise . 
this will be done with our full support where we think the risks of inflation are greater . 
the chancellor is widely expected to trim the basic rate of income tax to 23 percent from the present 24 percent in the budget in an effort to boost the Conservative government &apos;s dismal opinion poll ratings . 
the opposition Labour Party has a strong lead in opinion polls and the election must be held by next May . 
however , the budget deficit was a higher than expected 4.53 billion pounds ( $ 7.05 billion ) in August , according to official figures released on Tuesday , and economists said this could limit the chancellor &apos;s scope for headline-grabbing tax cuts .
