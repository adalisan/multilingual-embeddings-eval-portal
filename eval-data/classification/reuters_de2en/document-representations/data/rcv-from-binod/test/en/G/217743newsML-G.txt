lawyers defending a Bosnian Serb at the U.N. Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal said on Tuesday evidence against their client was unreliable and the case was doomed to fail . 
defence lawyer Michail Wladimiroff said prosecutors had relied solely on uncorroborated evidence from Moslem victims of the conflict in Bosnia to portray the defendant Dusan Tadic as a &quot; stereotypical , bloodthirsty Serb . 
he added : &quot; Such a prosecution , that is one-sided and incomplete , is doomed to failure . 
Wladimiroff was presenting closing arguments on behalf of Tadic , who denies charges of atrocities against Moslems during the &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; of northwest Bosnia by Serbs in 1992 . 
the trial , which began on May 7 , has heard more than 100 witnesses and been presented with 6,000 pages of evidence . 
a panel of three judges , sitting without a jury , is expected to rule early next year on whether Tadic is guilty . 
he faces a maximum penalty of life imprisonment . 
Wladimiroff said evidence given by prosecution witnesses was unreliable because in many cases it was the prejudiced testimony of Moslem victims who saw all Serbs as their oppressors . 
&quot; We submit that ... the evidence of the prosecution witnesses is insufficiently reliable to provide the basis of a conviction , &quot; Wladimiroff said . 
in her own closing arguments , prosecutor Brenda Hollis said Tadic had been a fervent Serb nationalist who herded his Moslem neighbours into camps where he murdered and tortured them . 
&quot; Justice will be served in this case by finding the accused guilty as charged , &quot; she said . 
dozens of witnesses said they had seen Tadic helping to round up Moslems in and around his home town of Kozarac and roaming the Serb-run prison camps to which they were sent . 
but only a handful testified to having seen him commit some of the more grisly crimes of which he has been accused . 
the prosecution suffered two major setbacks when a witness to an alleged atrocity at the notorious Omarska camp decided not to testify and another witness confessed to having lied . 
Wladimiroff made great play of these setbacks and used it to cast doubt on the credibility of other prosecution witnesses . 
during the seven-month trial defence lawyers sought to prove that Tadic was the victim of mistaken identity or a conspiracy by Moslems to frame him because of a misguided sense of revenge . 
they said Tadic had been on police duty , manning road blocks , when he was alleged to have been in the prison camps . 
Tadic , a former bar owner and father of two girls , showed little emotion as he sat out the final phase of the hearings . 
created by the U.N. Security Council in May 1993 , the tribunal has indicted 75 war crimes suspects to date but so far has only seven of them in custody . 
authorities in various areas of the former Yugoslavia have given only limited cooperation to the tribunal while NATO-led peacekeepers have been loath to hunt down and arrest suspects .
