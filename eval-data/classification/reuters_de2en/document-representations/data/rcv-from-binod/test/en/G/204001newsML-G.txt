U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry said in a British parliamentary publication released on Wednesday that NATO faced disintegration over Bosnia but is now vibrant and confident . 
he stressed the need for the alliance to be flexible and responsive in a fast evolving post-Cold war era and said a more constructive relationship could be built with Russia . 
&quot; paralysed into inaction , NATO seemed to be irrelevant in dealing with the Bosnian crisis , &quot; he wrote in the bi-annual parliamentary publication . 
&quot; It appeared to me that NATO was in the process of unravelling , &quot; he added . 
but he said NATO &apos;s peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia had now transformed the alliance . 
&quot; Today , despite all the problems that still exist in Sarajevo and Mostar , people are sipping coffee in the sidewalk cafes instead of dodging mortars and artillery shells , &quot; he wrote . 
NATO ambassadors agreed in principle on Monday that an international force should stay in Bosnia next year . 
a reduced force of 25,000 to 30,000 would probably replace the one now in the country whose mandate runs out on December 20 . 
Washington has said it is willing to keep some 8,500 troops in the region , reviewing their situation every six months until the middle of 1998 at the latest . 
Perry conceded that NATO was not well-structured for its Bosnia mission and said the command structure needed to be more responsive and the decision-making process faster . 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed the need for greater flexibility and warned : &quot; In the future , the United States may not always wish to take the lead in European crises . 
&quot; A new transatlantic bargain is called for , &quot; he wrote in the same review . 
Solana said Moscow should be reassured that NATO &apos;s enlargement was not a threat to Russia . 
he even suggested the possibility of armament cooperation between the former foes . 
British Defence Minister Michael Portillo warned that a fragmented European defence industry was a recipe for disaster . 
&quot; cost-effective cooperation , particularly in Europe , but also with the United States , is likely to be increasingly important in the future , &quot; he wrote in the review . 
&quot; What are Europe &apos;s weaknesses ? 
I would single out fragmentation , some over-manning , cost , short production runs , national protectionism , the inefficiency of our cooperative arrangements , &quot; he wrote . 
Britain is currently developing the Horizon frigate with France and Italy and the much delayed Eurofighter with Germany , Italy and Spain .
