Hong Kong gold ended higher from New York &apos;s previous close on overseas buying , dealers said . 
overseas buying , particularly from Japan , dominated the Hong Kong spot gold market , dealers said . 
local spot gold buying had been sidelined as the Hong Kong dollar shivered under speculative threats while other regional currencies remained flacid . 
&quot; The local currencies in the region remain weak and it &apos;s not very cheap to buy gold , people will wait for currencies to stablise before buying gold , &quot; said one dealer . 
sentiment had been weak during the day &apos;s trade , with Australian selling interest seen at $ 322 per ounce , traders said . 
gold could test $ 320 per ounce , some dealers said . 
they also noted they were keeping an eye on the Dow Jones Industrial average . 
the carry over charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society rose to -5.00 from its previous fix at + 6.00 .
