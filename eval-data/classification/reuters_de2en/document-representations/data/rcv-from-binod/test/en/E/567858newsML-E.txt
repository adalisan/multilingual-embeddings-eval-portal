Taiwan &apos;s April trade deficit will fuel a further depreciation of the Taiwan dollar and boost the competitiveness of the island &apos;s export-driven economy , analysts said on Wednesday . 
but they said the central bank might try to smooth the depreciation trend because of fears of an outflow of capital . 
it was Taiwan &apos;s first deficit since it reported a US $ 528 million shortfall in June 1995 . 
&quot; April &apos;s trade deficit will strengthen hope that the Taiwan dollar may fall further ( against the U.S. dollar ) in a bid to help Taiwan &apos;s export competitiveness , &quot; National Securities economist Lin Kuo-yang said . 
&quot; But the central bank is unlikely to allow a sharp Taiwan dollar depreciation due to fears over possible capital outflows especially at a time when people are worried about worsening social order . 
Taiwan people , angered by the kidnap and murder last month of the teenage daughter of a famous actress , have demanded action to halt a perceived worsening of crime levels . 
between January-April , Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US $ 1.61 billion , but down 52.4 percent from a year earlier . 
exports in April totalled US $ 9.84 billion , down 2.5 percent from April 1996 , but imports rose an annual 8.6 percent to US $ 10.043 billion , the finance ministry said . 
the Taiwan dollar closed on Tuesday at a 10-month low against the U.S. dollar of T $ 27.736 following foreign fund outflows and importers &apos; activity , dealers said . 
many analysts have forecast the Taiwan dollar will trend lower in the mid-term , having lagged other currencies in depreciating against the U.S. dollar . 
&quot; The Taiwan dollar likely will fall to test T $ 27.8 in the near term , and may test T $ 28 in the second half of 1997 , &quot; Nomura Securities economist Amy Huang said . 
economists said they expected the island &apos;s exports to continue to grow slowly , partly due to weak demand from Hong Kong and China . 
&quot; China &apos;s demand has been weakening , probably because Taiwan investors there , who gradually have become more independent , do not need so many imports of higher-technology semi-finished products from Taiwan , &quot; said Lin of National . 
rising export growth to Europe and the United States may be enough to cover the export declines to Hong Kong , China and Japan , Lin said , but overall export growth would not be strong . 
Hong Kong , which serves as the main conduit for Taiwan &apos;s lucrative trade with rival China , was the second biggest export destination -- after the United States -- with exports totalling US $ 2.353 billion in April , down 0.2 percent from a year ago . 
experts said imports should continue to enjoy higher growth than exports due to the recovering domestic economy . 
&quot; We have seen sound capital goods imports growth in the past months , which indicates rising domestic investments that have contributed to the recovering domestic economy , &quot; said Huang of Nomura . 
&quot; And the trend should continue . 
April &apos;s capital goods imports rose 11.7 percent year-on-year , while accumulated January-April capital goods imports gained 7.3 percent from a year ago .
