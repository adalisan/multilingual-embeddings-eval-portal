the capital of the Central African Republic remained divided by roadblocks into rival ethnic zones on Monday despite a regionally brokered truce between army mutineers and loyalist forces , residents said . 
scattered gunfire was heard overnight but the city was calm on Monday with motorists venturing out cautiously , testing the easing of tension . 
but roads leading to southern districts of Bangui which are under rebel control remained sealed off . 
people were still being checked for identity -- inevitably their tribe -- at roadblocks in both rebel and government-held districts . 
army grievances over pay and conditions have degenerated into a fight to topple President Ange-Felix Patasse . 
bloody feuding between the president &apos;s northern Baya tribespeople and southern Yakomas who dominate the ranks of the mutineers has killed scores of pople , residents say . 
leaders of the revolt that started on November 16 said they feared Patasse , kept in power by French troops during an earlier mutiny in May , would use the truce to crack down on them . 
&quot; President Patasse , who has never kept his word , will use the truce to infiltrate our bases , &quot; said Coporal Marc Yakota , one of the spokesmen for the mutiny . 
the government on Sunday agreed a 15-day truce after mediation by the presidents of Burkina Faso , Chad , Gabon and Mali . 
the deal was signed during lengthy talks at the French embassy and the French ambassador &apos;s residence in Bangui . 
the African leaders , mandated by last week &apos;s Franco-African summit , met mutineers and other parties to the conflict on Saturday . 
under the deal , Mali &apos;s former military leader General Amadou Toumani Toure , one of a handful of African leaders to hand over power voluntarily , would examine the causes of the crisis . 
the revolt is the third of the year in the impoverished former French colony . 
this time mutineers want Patasse to quit . 
troops from former colonial power France , which intervened in May to protect Patasse , guard strategic points in Bangui with presidential guard and army loyalists . 
a spokesman for the mutineers put the death toll on all sides at 150 since the latest mutiny began . 
captain Anicet Saulett , leader of the mutineers , told Reuters before Sunday &apos;s talks that the resignation of Patasse and the departure of what mutineers say are Chadian and Sudanese mercenaries in his pay were non-negotiable . 
precise numbers of people killed in tribal recriminations have proved difficult to verify but victims include former interior minister Christophe Grelombe , a Yakoma , and his son , who were seized on Thursday and murdered . 
eleven opposition parties have signed a memorandum blaming Patasse for the turmoil and accusing him of ignoring accords that ended the May mutiny . 
&quot; He is no longer in a position to embody national unity , &quot; they said .
