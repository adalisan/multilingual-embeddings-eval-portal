Egypt and Israel said at a Middle East peace summit on Tuesday they needed more time and consultations with the Palestinians to restart peace talks stalled by differences over Jewish settlements . 
&quot; We need another meeting and we need more deliberation , &quot; Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told a news conference after three hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh . 
&quot; I think you would agree that this is a positive beginning , &quot; Netanyahu said , referring to the meeting with Mubarak . 
&quot; But we need more work and we are committed to work together with you ( Egypt ) to achieve progress . 
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have stopped since March after Israel broke ground on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem . 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat refuses to restart talks until the construction work stops , something that Netanyahu has said he will not do . 
Egypt , which often mediates in peace talks , has said it would speak for the Palestinians at Tuesday &apos;s summit . 
Mubarak met Arafat in Cairo on Monday to coordinate their views ahead of the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting . 
Mubarak , who also spoke to Arafat by telephone during Tuesday &apos;s meeting , said he would hold further contacts with the Palestinian leader soon .
