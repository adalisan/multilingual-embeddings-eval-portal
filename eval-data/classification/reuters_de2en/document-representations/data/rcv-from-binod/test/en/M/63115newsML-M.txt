the Australian share market slipped further in late trading on Wednesday on continuing concerns about the direction of metal prices and emerging bearish sentiment towards industrial shares . 
the All Ordinaries index closed 19.30 points lower at 2235.10 . 
the September share price index fell 29 points to 2,233 and slipped to a 2.1 point discount to the underlying index . 
brokers said the market had been weighed down by BHP which was affected by warrant-related trading as well as concerns about metal prices . 
&quot; The resources are looking quite delicate , while the industrials started to come back a bit today , &quot; said a broker . 
&quot; So in all it &apos;s been another poor day and it doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s going to get much better for the rest of the week . 
the broker said the smaller than expected rise in Australian imports for August had a slight negative effect on the market . 
&quot; Those figures were seen as a bit soft , which doesn &apos;t help the market . 
economists said the import figures suggested that a interest rate cut remained on the agenda before the end of 1996 .
