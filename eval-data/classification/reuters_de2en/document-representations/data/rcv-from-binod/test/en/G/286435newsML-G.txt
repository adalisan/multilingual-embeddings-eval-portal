have a glass of water , rub your chest , stretch your left elbow towards your right knee , then stretch your right elbow towards your left knee : Finnish teachers are finding it helps children concentrate . 
a school therapist said on Friday a coordinated experiment with regular &quot; brain gymnastics &quot; at a school in Lahti , southern Finland , has cut the time it takes one teacher &apos;s class to settle down to five minutes from 15 . 
therapist Maija-Liisa Leppanen said by telephone that the exercises , based on so-called neuro-linguistic-programming , help the left and right hemispheres of the brain communicate and can be good for adults too . 
&quot; If you combine the exercise with thinking about your objectives , the results can be very good , &quot; Leppanen said . 
so stand up . 
cross your hands and pull them towards your chest , cross your feet , raise your eyes and stand still , with both eyes focused on the ceiling . 
feel better ?
