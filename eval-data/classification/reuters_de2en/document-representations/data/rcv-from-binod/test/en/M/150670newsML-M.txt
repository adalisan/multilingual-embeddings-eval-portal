U.S. millfeed prices were steady to lower on Tuesday with several dealers noting lackluster activity in the spot market . 
&quot; People seemed to be concentrating on harvesting ( corn and beans ) and are not worried at all about feed business yet , &quot; a Kansas dealer said . 
Kansas City spot prices dropped $ 3.00 to bid at $ 98.00 a ton and offered at $ 100.00 . 
spot Kansas / Oklahoma interior values fell $ 2.00 to offer at $ 113 a ton . 
&quot; Today ( Tuesday ) is not enough to make a market , &quot; a Minneapolis broker said . 
but &quot; I &apos;m hoping for a little more interest this afternoon and tomorrow ( Wednesday ) &quot; , he said , adding that he believed demand was holding steady . 
&quot; Everybody is saying they do not want to sell anything unless they take care of their former commitments . 
that makes the nearby real tight , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the mills ( in the Carolinas ) are running full bore . 
mills in the Northeast were on shorter time schedules . 
&quot; It was lesser run times than what we have seen three weeks ago , &quot; a buffalo dealer said . 
he noted that mills were running about five to five and one-half days instead of six days . 
&quot; It is a reflection of a little less run time that continues to keep the nearby market pretty tight , &quot; he said .
