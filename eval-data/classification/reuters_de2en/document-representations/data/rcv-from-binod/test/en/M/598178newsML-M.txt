U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Wednesday were seen steady to $ 0.50 per cwt lower amid ideas that soft pork demand will continue to limit packer buying , livestock dealers said . 
Packer demand also could be curbed as the industry starts gearing down for the Memorial Day holiday on Monday , sources said . 
major U.S. pork packers said their slaughter plants would be closed Monday in observance of the holiday . 
a hog buyer with one prominent company said his firm had enough hogs for Wednesday and was almost finished buying for Thursday in the Iowa / southern Minnesota area . 
Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs Tuesday sold at a thin top of $ 60.00 for hogs delivered to plants , but most sold at $ 59.00 , USDA reported . 
livestock dealers said prices on Wednesday for hogs at plants could range $ 59.00 to $ 59.50 . 
top prices for hogs delivered to plants in Illinois were seen holding steady with Tuesday at $ 59.00 and hogs in Indiana and Ohio could range steady- $ 0.50 lower at $ 58.50 to $ 59.00 . 
packers have been fighting unprofitable operating margins since late April by cutting back slaughter . 
however , light hog supplies offset potential weakness from the reduced demand and kept margins deep in the red , market sources said . 
&quot; I think what they &apos;ll try to do now is pull back even further and hope that product prices will improve , &quot; said Dale Benson , livestock analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds . 
U.S. hog slaughter on Tuesday was estimated by USDA at 324,000 head , which brought the week to date figure to 614,000 , down 2.8 percent from last week at 632,000 and down 2.2 percent from last year &apos;s kill of 628,000 , USDA statistics showed .
