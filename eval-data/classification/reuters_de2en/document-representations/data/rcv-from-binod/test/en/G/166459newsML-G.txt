the chief of Beijing &apos;s de facto embassy in Hong Kong gave his blessing on Tuesday to a newly formed committee which will organise a gala of parties and feasts to celebrate the territory &apos;s return to China next year . 
organisers said HK $ 50 million ( US $ 6.4 million ) in private donations had already poured into the kitty of the Association for Celebration of reunification of Hong Kong with China to be used to organise celebrations straddling the handover at midnight on June 30 , 1997 . 
the association is chaired by senior members of the Preparatory Committee , the group appointed by China to oversee the handover , and has 1,500 members , mostly professionals and business people . 
at an inauguration ceremony attended by prominent Hong Kong professionals and pro-Beijing politicians , Zhou Nan , the director of the Xinhua news agency in Hong Kong , said Chinese all over the world were yearning for the transfer of sovereignty after more than 150 years of British rule . 
&quot; The resumption of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong would wipe away over a hundred years of national shame , &quot; Zhou said to more than a thousand guests . 
&quot; Chinese all over the world will welcome and celebrate the realisation of this ideal . 
Zhou was flanked throughout much of the ceremony by Tung Chee-hwa and Simon Li , prominent candidates vying to become Hong Kong &apos;s first chief executive after the handover . 
a 400-member Selection Committee , appointed by the Preparatory Committee , is scheduled to name the chief executive-designate on December 11 . 
continuous bickering between the two sovereign powers over Hong Kong in recent years had threatened to mar the handover next year , and it was not until recently that the two sides amicably agreed to hold joint and dignified celebrations .
