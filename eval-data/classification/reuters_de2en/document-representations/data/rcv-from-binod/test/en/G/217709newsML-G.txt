troops should go to eastern Zaire now and they should use force , if they have to , to get access to refugees and other people stranded there , EU aid chief Emma Bonino said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Access to the area must be gained now , either by peaceful means or &apos; manu militari &apos; , &quot; Bonino , the European Union &apos;s humanitarian aid commissioner , said in a statement . 
she said she was speaking out because governments and the military chiefs of the world &apos;s most powerful countries seemed to be at a loss to work out how many refugees there were , where they were and in what conditions they were living . 
&quot; This is amazing . 
there is one straightforward answer to this problem : to organise promptly a military assessment mission to the area , in order to check once and for all , how many people there are , where they are , and what is happening to them . 
the hunt continued on Tuesday by military aircraft on Tuesday for hundreds of thousands of &quot; missing &quot; Rwandan refugees believed to be in the area . 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated there were 1.2 million Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire until mid-November . 
but since November 15 , tens of thousands have returned home in a mass exodus to escape intense fighting between the Zairean army , Zairean rebels and Hutu militiamen . 
aid agencies and the U.S. military estimate that up to 600,000 have returned to Rwanda , but where the rest are is a mystery . 
aid workers had to leave the area because of the fighting and the rebels have not allowed them in since , although they agreed this week to allow assessment work to begin .
