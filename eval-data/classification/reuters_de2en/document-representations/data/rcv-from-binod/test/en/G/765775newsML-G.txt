envoys of Sierra Leone &apos;s military rulers interrupted talks with their West African neighbours in Ivory Coast on Wednesday to consult on the status of ousted president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah , conference sources said . 
the two sides were meeting to head off a showdown over the widely condemned May 25 coup that ousted Kabbah . 
the envoys were to seek guidance from the ruling junta in Freetown on a demand from a Nigerian-led committee of four West African foreign ministers that Kabbah be reinstated immediately , the sources added . 
the junta was in parallel session in the Sierra Leone capital Freetown and the envoys were not authorised to take any decision on the issue , the sources said . 
the talks , day two of a second round of meetings between envoys of the junta and foreign ministers from Nigeria , Ivory Coast , Ghana and Guinea , began eight hours behind schedule . 
earlier , conference sources said the junta had spelled out clearly that it would not have Kabbah back and called for Nigerian troops , in Sierra Leone under a pre-coup defence pact , to vacate key positions in the capital Freetown . 
after agreeing in principle to restore democracy the junta was demanding recognition from ECOWAS , the Economic Community of West African States , where Nigeria has led calls for the army to be forced to step down . 
&quot; We are talking about an entrenched regime being asked to stand down . 
it has never happened in Africa and it won &apos;t be easy in the case of Sierra Leone , &quot; one diplomat told Reuters . 
junta delegates have argued that , by holding talks with them , the 16-member ECOWAS had implicitly recognised their government . 
they want a transitional period in which to restore democracy . 
the return of Kabbah , who is exiled in neighbouring Guinea , is a key demand of the Organisation of African Unity . 
it is also a central part of an agreement signed by both sides at an earlier meeting in Ivory Coast on July 18 , ECOWAS officials say . 
junta envoys interpret that as simply restoring democracy . 
diplomats comparing the crisis in Sierra Leone with Haiti in 1991-93 said ECOWAS could not realistically return Kabbah to power without a credible threat of force against the junta , as the United States did in Haiti . 
soldiers toppled Haiti &apos;s elected president Jean Betrand Aristide in October 1991 , forcing him to flee to Venezuela . 
Aristide was returned to power two years later to serve out his term with the backing of U.S. and other regional troops . 
Nigerian troops leading a regional military force , ECOMOG , bombarded Freetown on June 2 trying to reverse the coup . 
the poorly coordinated attack failed and Nigeria has since joined regional efforts to negotiate the departure of the junta . 
&quot; There doesn &apos;t appear to be any country in ECOWAS prepared to join Nigeria in using force in Sierra Leone , &quot; a diplomat at the talks said . 
&quot; And it doesn &apos;t look like Nigerians will want to go it alone after their experience on June 2 .
