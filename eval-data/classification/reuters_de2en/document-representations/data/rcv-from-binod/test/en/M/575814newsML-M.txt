Latin American stocks are likely to push higher this week on strong foreign buying and as speculation eases that the Federal Reserve will jack up interest rates , said analysts . 
on the region &apos;s five main bourses , prices were generally expected to climb this week on a mixture of foreign and domestic factors , with only Buenos Aires seen holding flat , they said . 
&quot; Prices look strong and much less volatile than a couple of weeks ago . 
the outlook is basically positive , &quot; said Enrique Danoni , analyst at Santiago brokers Sud Americano , talking about the Chilean market , although his sentiment summed up feeling in much of Latin America . 
but problems persist in the Chilean electrical sector , the biggest single industry on the Santiago bourse . 
power utilities are being forced to buy electricity at markups to compensate for the effects of drought on reservoirs , dragging down profits , said Danoni . 
he saw better prospects in the paper pulp sector , especially at COPEC , while traders also pointed to strong foreign buying . 
the selective index ended Friday at 120.60 points , up one percent for the week and a high for the year . 
in Mexico , stocks were seen extending their gains as fears receded of a large hike in U.S. interest rates at a key Federal Reserve meeting on May 20 , analysts said . 
they forecast a rise of no more than 25 basis points in the benchmark rate -- a rise already factored into prices . 
&quot; It &apos;s too early for profit-takers to step in . 
the movement is only just beginning , &quot; said Carlos Samano , head of research at Mexico &apos;s Bancomer brokerage . 
he saw a drop in domestic rates giving further impetus to the market . 
&quot; Domestic rates should come down because of enhanced market liquidity , government spending is behind schedule and many firms pay out profit-sharing schemes in May , &quot; he said . 
Mexico &apos;s blue-chip IPC closed Friday at 3,873.38 points , up 2.88 percent for the week . 
Brazilian shares were also expected to firm this week , on optimism that Congress will pass a bill setting rules for privatization of the telecoms industry in the coming months . 
higher bidding for the band B cellular phone business has also boosted prices , brokers said . 
&quot; The market continues to be upbeat on telecoms , &quot; said a senior trader . 
Sao Paulo shares ended 4.1 percent higher last week at 10,491 points . 
strong foreign demand was expected to boost blue chips in Venezuela , where Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar said the International Monetary Fund shared official forecasts of up to four percent growth this year and five percent in 1998 . 
&quot; Blue chips look good ... foreign funds are building up positions because they see good long-term prospects for the economy , &quot; said Banplus broker Alberto Briceno . 
the Caracas bourse &apos;s 19-share index ended Friday at 6,585.58 points , up 3.5 percent for the week , as foreign investors snapped up stocks with American depositary receipts . 
the outlook was more sober in Buenos Aires , where stocks were expected to stay locked in a tight range and focus on the release of U.S. inflation indicators before the Fed &apos;s meeting May 20 , dealers said . 
&quot; There will be a wait-and-see attitude in the final countdown to the Fed talks , &quot; said Gabriel Armando at Argentine brokers Galicia Valores . 
&quot; If the Fed hikes rates we may drift sideways for a while longer ; but if it doesn &apos;t , stocks should embark on a sold recovery . 
on the local front , investors were awaiting details of the planned $ 3 billion sale of the National Mortgage Bank and news from an IMF team currently in Buenos Aires studying a new loan deal . 
the Merval slipped 1.2 percent last week to 723.78 points but still stands fractionally higher so far in May .
