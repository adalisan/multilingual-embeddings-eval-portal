Britain &apos;s top law official urged the Council of Europe on Monday to rein in its enforcement of human rights rules , saying it should not meddle in states &apos; sensitive internal affairs . 
the Lord Chancellor , Lord Mackay of Clashfern , said he held talks with officials of the Council of Europe and its two human rights arms -- the European Court of Human Rights and European Commission of Human Rights -- to discuss &quot; matters of mutual concern &quot; about the council &apos;s human rights enforcement machinery . 
&quot; It is important that the procedures of the court should enable it to give proper weight to laws passed by the parliaments of democratic countries , &quot; he said in a statement . 
&quot; They ( national parliaments ) are best placed to determine moral and social issues in accordance with regional and national perceptions . 
Britain &apos;s Conservative government has criticised the rights court and commission for a series of recent rulings that it says constitute outside meddling in its ability to govern . 
Mackay &apos;s visit came on a day that the Euro-court , in a rare victory for Britain , issued a ruling upholding a controversial ban on an erotic film about the visions of a 16th-century Spanish nun , rejecting charges that it violated the director &apos;s freedom of expression . 
the judges ruled by seven to two that Britain &apos;s 1989 ban on the 18-minute &quot; visions of Ecstasy &quot; about the Roman Catholic mystic Saint Teresa of Avila was justified under blasphemy laws to avoid shocking Christians . 
but Mackay said he had come to discuss his general concerns rather than &quot; to advance some case which is solely in the interests of the UK &quot; . 
he advocated reforms in the way judges are appointed and urged the court and commission to give greater leeway to domestic courts in sensitive matters . 
the human rights commission , which screens cases for the court , angered London in September by agreeing to take up the case of a British 12-year-old boy seeking to overturn British laws allowing his parents to smack him . 
last year the court condemned Britain for the killings of three unarmed Irish Republican Army bombers in Gibraltar in 1988 . 
and this year it condemned Britain &apos;s system for jailing minors . 
the 40-nation council , headquartered in Strasbourg , northeastern France , was set up following World War Two to foster democracy and human rights across Europe .
