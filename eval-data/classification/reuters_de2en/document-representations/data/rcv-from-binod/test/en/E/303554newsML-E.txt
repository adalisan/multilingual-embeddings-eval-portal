retail transactions should show a rebound for December , but whether longer pre-Christmas checkout lines translated into the substantially higher sales that retailers had hoped for is questionable , economists said . 
&quot; The retailers were generally expecting a better Christmas , &quot; said David Sloan , economist at consulting firm I.D.E.A. 
Inc . &quot; I think they got a reasonable Christmas shopping ( season ) , but not a strong one they were expecting . 
retail sales , due at 0830 est / 1330 GMT Tuesday January 14 , are expected to have risen 0.5 percent in December after slumping 0.4 percent in November , according to the average forecast of economists in a Reuters survey . 
forecasters largely based their overall projections on lackluster chain-store sales in December . 
as monthly data filtered in from large stores across the U.S. , most analysts said they were unimpressed by the December results . 
&quot; As far as we can tell from looking at chain store sales , they were relatively mediocre , &quot; said Bruce Steinberg , manager of micreconomic analysis at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc . 
last Thursday , retailers -- from department stores to specialty stores -- reported widely mixed results for December , the most important shopping month of the year . 
but while sales were near plan for many stores , the gains were well below the more optimistic forecasts on Wall Street of five to nine percent . 
in fact , the Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co same-store sales index was up only 2.9 percent in December compared with a weak December 1995 , making 1996 another of the worst Christmas seasons in more than a decade . 
but even though the consumer represents two-thirds of the U.S. economy , with half of that at the retail register , economists said the halfhearted holiday spending spree should not detract from overall economic growth significantly . 
&quot; Fourth-quarter ( gross domestic product ) will still likely be stronger than anticipated prior to the quarter &apos;s start , even with these mediocre chain store sales and the Christmas season in general , because of the up-tic in services , &quot; said Marilyn Schaja , money market economist at investment bank Donaldson , Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. &quot; But that is not really reflected in these retail sales numbers . 
automobile sales are expected to have been relatively flat in December , leaving the retail sales gain at 0.4 percent with cars excluded , economists said . 
&quot; We are looking for small increases in the way the autos get measured , based on the auto units sold , &quot; said Schaja . 
the firm &apos;s forecast for retail sales mirrors the survey &apos;s average . 
but Sloan said the introduction of some new auto models , which usually roll off assembly lines in October , has been delayed until January , which could have depress car sales temporarily . 
forecasts retail sales fell 0.1 percent overall but rose 0.5 percent with autombiles excluded .
