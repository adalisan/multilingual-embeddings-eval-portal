Singapore prompt gas oil market was weighed down by high stocks and weak demand but was expected to pick up moderately for second-half July and August barrels , traders said on Tuesday . 
&quot; There is overall perception that there is a prompt overhang in June and this is compounded by the fact that the arbitrage from the Mediterranean is now wide open , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; The market would only improve if there more run cuts at Singapore refineries . 
traders said China was expected to continue buying small volumes in June but there were mixed views about their requirements in July . 
some traders said their imports might improve July . 
but the return of Chinese domestic refineries from shutdown would once again lift their output and stocks but this would only curb imports if domestic diesel prices are lowered to compete with international prices . 
the market is also awaiting the effects on diesel import pattern after the handover of Hong Kong to China at the end of this month . 
traders also said Indonesia &apos;s demand would pick up from second-half July and August as two refineries are scheduled to shut their respective crude distillation units . 
the Balikpapan refinery will shut its 200,000-barrel-per-day crude unit for a month from July 10 , while the Cilacap complex will shut a 100,000-bpd crude unit for 35 days from August 13 . 
traders said most of India &apos;s 855,000 tonnes imports for July would come from national oil companies and majors and sourced from the Mediterranean which would not give too much support to the Asian market . 
traders said offers for prompt cargoes--July 18-22--was seen as low as $ 24.90 . 
but the tone on the forward weeks remained steady , with a 150,000-barrel parcel sold by a European major to a Japanese trader at $ 25.30 per barrel for June 29-July 3 lifting free-on-board ( fob ) basis . 
the softer tone was also seen on prompt swaps gas oil with four active sellers seen facing two active buyers , which include a Chinese trader . 
June swaps was quoted at $ 25 / 00 / $ 25.10 per barrel while July was indicated at $ 24.95 / $ 25.05 , reflecting a narrower June / July tome spread to five cents from a traded 20 cents on Monday . 
Taiwan has tendered to sell 225,000-250,000 barrels of 0.3-percent sulphur diesel for July 2-19 , closing June 9 . 
Taiwan sold two cargoes in its last tender for June 4-17 lifting at a low level of $ 24.60 per barrel , fob . 
Vietnam &apos;s Petrolimex is expected to issue its July-September import tender for diesel , fuel oil and gasoline on June 20 , a Hanoi source said . 
the volume is expected to be almost similar to what Vietnam bought in the second quarter , the source added . 
jet fuel was also well-offered with four sellers seen around $ 24.60 per barrel and buyers continuing to stay away .
