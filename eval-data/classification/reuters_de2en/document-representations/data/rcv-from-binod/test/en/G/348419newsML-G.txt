Britain &apos;s leading broadcasters are forging ahead with plans to beam a television revolution into the nation &apos;s living rooms . 
a new digital era in which viewers can access hundreds of channels and interactive services such as home banking and shopping has this week come much closer to reality . 
pay television operator British Sky Broadcasting is reported to be proceeding with plans to launch a 200-channel digital satellite service into Britain in late 1997 . 
BSkyB announced on Friday that it was joining forces with leading commercial television ( ITV ) companies Carlton and Granada to apply for licences to supply up to 15 channels for digital terrestrial television ( DTT ) . 
their venture would also carry BBC subscription channels , as well as top sports action and Hollywood movies . 
it will make some 30 channels -- including the free-to-air quartet of BBC1 , BBC2 , ITV and Channel 4 -- available in the new , high quality format . 
the cable companies are also planning to switch to digital in an attempt to compete with BSkyB &apos;s satellite services . 
digital viewers will need to invest in a set-top box to receive and unscramble signals , help them chart their way through the sea of channels and pay for programmes or services . 
broadcasters are seeking potential partners to subsidise the boxes , aiming to bring the cost to the customer down to around 200 pounds ( $ 325 ) . 
television sets with built-in decoders are expected to reach the market within a couple of years . 
the technnology is of course not unique to Britain and digital television is already up and running in the United States , South Africa , and a number of European nations . 
applicants for the DTT licences see it as a way to bring pay television to households who don &apos;t want satellite dishes or their front gardens dug up by cable companies . 
BSkyB , Britain &apos;s leading pay television company , has more than five million subscribers but over 75 percent of British households have neither cable nor satellite . 
television experts believe that many of them will be prepared to pay for the right mix of sports and movies . 
&quot; going digital is the most important development for British television since the introduction of colour , &quot; said Michael Green , chairman of British Digital Broadcasting , the new Carlton / BSkyB / Granada combination . 
&quot; Within a few years , the public will be able to buy new digital television sets capable of receiving all digital services and one day , all television signals will be received in this way , &quot; he added . 
the brave new world is made possible by the quantum leap to digital from the analogue technology which has been used since the birth of broadcasting in the 1920s . 
in digital broadcasting , sound and pictures are converted into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones -- rather than transmitted by radio waves as under the analogue method . 
digital signals are more robust and so quality is greatly enhanced while a process of compression means that the number of services that can be carried is increased many times over . 
&quot; Within 10 years , over half of all households may be receiving multi-channel , digital television , &quot; the BBC said in a document published last year . 
BBC director-general John Birt saw a future in which viewers could order their own diet of programmes on a hybrid machine , a cross between a television and personal computer , with a large , flat , wall-mounted screen showing high quality images .
