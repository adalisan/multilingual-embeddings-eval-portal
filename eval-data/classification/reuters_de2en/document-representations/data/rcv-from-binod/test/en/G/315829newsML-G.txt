a centrist minister called on Friday for a summit of government coalition party leaders to clear the air after an embarrassing defeat in the Italian parliament that exposed the shakiness of the alliance . 
communications Minister Antonio Maccanico , a leading moderate , issued his call after the government lost a vote on a bill linked to its privatisation programme when the party which ensures its majority , Communist Refoundation , abstained . 
&quot; It is always opportune , when things like this happen , to have a review , a common reflection of all the forces that support the government , &quot; Maccanico told Italian radio . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi &apos;s centre-left &quot; Olive Tree &quot; government has no outright majority of its own in the Chamber of Deputies ( lower house ) , where it must rely on Communist Refoundation &apos;s 35 deputies to pass legislation . 
the Marxist party provides external support to Prodi but is opposed to many of his key economic policies , including on privatisation of strategic industries and social spending cuts . 
it demonstrated its power on Wednesday night by abstaining in a lower house vote to transfer a controlling interest in telecoms holding STET from state conglomerate IRI to the Treasury as a prelude to STET &apos;s privatisation . 
the ensuing four-vote defeat was partly the result of poor organisation -- many coalition deputies missed the ballot -- but highlighted Prodi &apos;s dependence on Refoundation for survival . 
Prodi has insisted the privatisation programme will go ahead and that the transfer arrangements can be made in other ways . 
however , he acknowledged the implications of the defeat . 
&quot; It was an important alarm signal , a political message . 
that is the way I took it , &quot; he told reporters during a visit to Croatia on Thursday . 
Prodi &apos;s Olive Tree alliance , which won a general election last April , ranges from centrists to the large ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left ( PDS ) . 
the STET debacle fired fresh calls from within the coalition to seek support from the centre-right opposition Freedom Alliance on policy which Communist Refoundation will not back . 
&quot; Nobody can stop the Olive Tree from seeking consensus in parliament , especially on privatisation , which is one of the issues dear to the Freedom Alliance , &quot; said Franco Marini , leader of the centrist Popular Party . 
he was echoed by Maccanico , who said a vote for the government was welcome wherever it came from . 
&quot; The government presented itself to parliament with a programme that was very precise on the problem of privatisation and it won a vote of confidence on that programme , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It therefore has every right to carry it forward . 
some Freedom Alliance deputies expressed guarded readiness to consider the offer but the talk of fishing for opposition support received short shrift from Communist Refoundation , which indicated that such moves would add to the strains . 
&quot; Prodi can say what he likes but he must have realised by now that the Olive Tree does not have a majority of votes , &quot; the party &apos;s president , Armando Cossutta , said . 
&quot; It is thanks to communist deputies that his government is on its feet , &quot; he told Il Giornale newspaper .
