Argentine journalists held a rally and a minute of silence on Tuesday to mark one month since the brutal murder of a news photographer , a crime that many suspect has links with authorities . 
a crowd of thousands including politicians , unionists and human rights groups rallied at the offices of news magazine Noticias to demand justice for the murder of its photographer Jose Luis Cabezas . 
taxis and buses stopped and church bells tolled in the minute &apos;s silent homage . 
Cabezas &apos; charred and handcuffed body was found in a burned-out car in the beach resort of Pinamar on Jan . 25 . 
the 35-year-old father of three had been tortured , shot in the head , doused with gasoline and burned to a skeleton . 
it was a gruesome reminder of the &quot; death squads &quot; that terrorised Argentina before and during the military rule of 1976 to 1983 . 
Cabezas &apos; former colleague Gabriel Micchi told the crowd chanting &quot; Justice ! 
justice ! 
&quot; : &quot; This crime symbolises for all of Argentina the return of ghosts from the past . 
in Lima , a group of about 20 international photographers covering the siege at the residence of the Japanese ambassador to Peru also commemorated the killing , raising their cameras and holding up photographs of Cabezas . 
a poll published in Argentina on Tuesday showed 85 percent thought the killers &quot; have links with political powers &quot; and 59 percent feared it &quot; presages a new wave of political violence . 
in a damning indictment of the Peronist administration of President Carlos Menem , the poll in the respected financial daily El Cronista also showed more than 91 percent believe &quot; there are mafias linked with or protected by the government . 
another poll in Clarin newspaper said 71 percent thought the crime would not be solved . 
five suspects were being held but investigators said none of them were thought to be the masterminds of the crime . 
one of those arrested , convicted killer Margarita Di Tullio , alias &quot; Pepita la Pistolera &quot; ( Pepita the gun girl ) , told Clarin from prison : &quot; Cabezas &apos; killing was a horrendous political crime and they wanted a scapegoat with a record like mine , so here I am . 
investigators said they were also investigating members of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police in charge of the case . 
Noticias , the country &apos;s top-selling weekly news magazine , has uncovered major corruption scandals , including graft in the Buenos Aires Provincial Police . 
one theory has also linked the murder to a power struggle between Menem and Buenos Aires Province &apos;s Peronist Governor Eduardo Duhalde , who is campaigning to succeed Menem in 1999 .
