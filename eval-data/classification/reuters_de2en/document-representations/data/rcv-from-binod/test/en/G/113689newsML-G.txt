South African selector Ray Mordt resigned on Monday two days after coach Andre Markgraaff dropped Francois Pienaar from the squad to tour Argentina , France and Wales next month . 
Mordt would not say if the surprise omission of flanker Pienaar from the 36-man springbok squad had influenced his decision . 
Mordt said earlier in a radio interview that he was unhappy with the decision to axe Pienaar . 
being Transvaal coach , I can &apos;t see other games as a selector , &quot; Mordt said 
South African rugby union fans expressed outrage on Monday at the axing of Pienaar and demanded the resignation of national coach Andre Markgraaff . 
in a flood of calls to radio stations , supporters of Pienaar called for a spectator boycott of the Currie Cup semifinal between Transvaal and Northern Transvaal at Loftus Versveld on on Saturday . 
Pienaar , who led South Africa to victory in the World Cup last year and is one of the most successful captains in springbok history , will lead Transvaal in the Pretoria match . 
his omission from the squad to tour Argentina , Wales and France was announced by Markgraaff , who said on Saturday there was no place for the flanker in his vision of the springbok future . 
Markgraaff compounded the disbelief of many fans by including in the squad a little-known 32-year-old flanker , Theo Oosthuizen , who plays for one of the country &apos;s weaker sides , Griqualand West . 
South African Rugby Football Union ( SARFU ) spokesman Alex Broun defended Markgraaff &apos;s decision but acknowledged some top players were upset . 
&quot; Of course the Transvaal players and all players involved with Francois during the World Cup , many of them are hurt by the decision , I mean they &apos;ve been through fire with Francois . 
&quot; But I think Andre has the complete confidence of all the players , &quot; Broun said . 
&quot; If you look at the team , it &apos;s a very strong side to play an exciting , open brand of rugby ... 
yet there are going to be sacrifices to pay . 
but Andre must be given the chance to do what he believes is best . 
a poll conducted over Sunday and Monday morning elicited a flood of comment from rugby-mad South Africans who voted overwhelmingly in support of retaining Pienaar as captain . 
a total of 67,522 callers backed Pienaar and called for Markgraaff to step down while 3,136 voted the other way . 
&quot; We were told we are building a team for the 1999 World Cup , surely a 32-year-old unknown player from Griqualand West won &apos;t qualify , so what is he actually doing in the team ? 
&quot; asked a caller to state radio . 
Markgraaff , who took over as coach from Kitch Christie who stepped down for health reasons after taking the Springboks to victory in the World Cup , used to coach Griqualand West . 
Christie himself condemned Pienaar &apos;s sacking . 
&quot; It is a sad day for South African rugby ... How can you do that to a man who made this country so proud in last year &apos;s World Cup ? 
&quot; he asked . 
the Springboks have struggled to attain their World Cup heights this year , losing five out of seven tests against New Zealand and Australia . 
the record this year included losing their first home test series ever to the All Blacks . 
Pienaar did not play in the series due to injury and was replaced as captain by number eight Gary Teichmann , who was named on Saturday as captain for the November tour . 
Markgraaff sparked controversy during that series when he refused to select winger James Small , accusing him variously of indiscipline and failing to get along with his fellow Springboks . 
small was back in the squad named on Saturday .
