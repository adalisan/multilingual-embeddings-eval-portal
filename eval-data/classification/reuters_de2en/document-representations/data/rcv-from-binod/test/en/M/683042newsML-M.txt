Hong Kong stocks closed lower on Tuesday in volatile trading as investors took the weak U.S. market as an excuse to trim their holdings ahead of the long weekend , brokers said . 
the Hang Seng Index fell 130.27 points , or 0.87 percent , to finish at 14,890.96 . 
the index fell over 220 points at the open on the Dow Industrials &apos; 192-point drop overnight , then a brief rebound erased the loss , but prices staggered down after that . 
&quot; Since there are five days holiday at the weekend , people are trimming down their portfolios , &quot; said Louis Tse , executive director of Standard Capital brokerage . 
but brokers said the Dow &apos;s impact was limited as investors are shifting their focus from the U.S. market to the Chinese market and economy ahead of the territory &apos;s reversion to China . 
the market will be closed on Monday through Wednesday next week to mark Hong Kong &apos;s handover to Chinese sovereignty after more than 150 years of British colonial rule . 
&quot; Last Friday &apos;s one-day gain was quite a lump sum and I believe we can afford to have profit-taking in these couple of days , &quot; Tse added . 
the Hang Seng posted its biggest point-gain ever with a 647.87-point jump on Friday . 
hang Seng index futures were traded at a premium , which showed investors &apos; confidence in the post-handover market , said Peter So , deputy head of research at Schroder Securities . 
June index futures closed at 14,960 , down 140 points but a premium of 69 points to the spot index . 
&quot; Selling was limited since the market believes chances for an imminent interet rate hike are pretty limited , &quot; So said . 
the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee will hold a meeting on July 1-2 to discuss interest rate policy . 
but Delta Asia Securities senior research manager Ricky Tam cautioned global markets may ease if Wall Street stays weak . 
but Television broadcasts surged HK $ 1.10 to HK $ 35.00 on vague hopes that China-related companies might be interested in taking a stake in the broadcaster , brokers said . 
the Hang Seng red chip index fell 23.78 points , or 0.78 percent , to 3,042.85 .
