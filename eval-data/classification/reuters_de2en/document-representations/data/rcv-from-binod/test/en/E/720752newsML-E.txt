the Bundesbank said on Thursday that its policy-making council left the German discount and Lombard rates unchanged after its regular meeting . 
the German discount rate remains at 2.50 percent and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 4.50 percent . 
the central bank &apos;s main money market rate , the repo , remains unchanged at three percent . 
the central bank council held this week &apos;s meeting in Aschau , a picturesque Bavarian town nestling in the foothills of the Alps . 
it holds one meeting a year outside Frankfurt and also traditionally holds a news conference . 
the interest rate decision was announced electronically from Frankfurt . 
no interest rate change had been expected from the meeting , but financial markets were waiting for comments from Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer on prospects for European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) , the recent appreciation of the dollar , and the outlook for German interest rates . 
the meeting comes at a time of fierce debate within Germany about the introduction if the planned single currency and against a background of a robust U.S. currency , which is helping to buoy share prices in Germany .
