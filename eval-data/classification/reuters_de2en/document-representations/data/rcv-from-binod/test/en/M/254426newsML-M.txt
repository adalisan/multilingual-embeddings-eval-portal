this year &apos;s rally at the Toronto Stock Exchange , Canada &apos;s biggest equity market , will stretch through 1997 and may last until the turn of the century , analysts forecast . 
&quot; I think the Toronto Stock Exchange is in the middle of a bull market , &quot; said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist with Oppenheimer &amp; Co Inc in New York . 
Canadian equities investors have enjoyed spectacular gains this year . 
Toronto &apos;s key 300 composite Index jumped as much as 28 percent in 1996 and was now up 21 percent after a correction this month . 
by contrast , the Dow Jones Industrial average , which Toronto generally tracks , was up 23 percent this year , down from a peak of 26 percent . 
analysts said Toronto &apos;s market -- the 10th most active worldwide -- would continue to benefit from poor bond yields , which make stocks more attractive . 
bond yields have dropped across the board this year , with 50 basis points shaved off the return of Canada &apos;s 30-year benchmark bonds . 
most of the seven analysts polled by Reuters said Toronto &apos;s 300 index next year would break its all-time high of 6018 points , set on November 28 . 
the index was at about 5700 on Friday . 
analysts &apos; median estimate for the 300 index was 6600 points by the end of 1997 , rising to 7600 by 1998 &apos;s close . 
&quot; We &apos;re in a general long-term uptrend , &quot; said Katherine Beattie , technical analyst for mms International in Toronto . 
&quot; The stock market is still going to be the best place to invest given the relatively low interest rates . 
&quot; We will start inching up , but even if we do get two or three interest rate hikes in the first couple of quarters next year - which I think is going to cause a correction in the markets - it &apos;s not going to put bonds or bills at a competitive enough level , &quot; Beattie said . 
Fred Ketchen , senior vice-president at brokerage ScotiaMcLeod Inc , said Canadian equities were being snapped up by the large baby boom population , which was now focusing on generating wealth for retirement amid the uncertain future of government pensions . 
&quot; I think that basically we &apos;re into fairly firm markets right through until the end of the century , &quot; Ketchen said . 
&quot; demographics are certainly helping here . 
Josef Schachter , president of Schachter Asset Management Inc , predicted Toronto &apos;s heavily weighted resource sectors could push the 300 index to 7000 by the end of 1997 and to at least 8500 a year later . 
&quot; I see ( it ) potentially higher than that if we can get precious metals ... and base metals joining the party , &quot; Schachter said . 
Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels forecast th index would climb to 8000 by the end of 1998 and 10000 by the year 2000 . 
but some analysts were more bearish , with John ING , president of Toronto-based Maison placements Canada Inc , predicting the index would sink to 5750 by the end of 1997 and 5400 by the end of 1998 . 
ING said interest rate hikes would cut short the party . 
&quot; The inevitable increase in rates has got to happen sometime within the next 12 months and that will test the markets , &quot; ING said .
