Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Wednesday defended a $ 23-billion natural gas deal with Iran that has hindered U.S. attempts to isolate Tehran through sanctions . 
&quot; What could be more natural than us getting such cheap , abundant natural gas from right next door ? 
&quot; Erbakan , an Islamist who heads a coalition with a conservative party , told a news conference on return from a 10-day official trip abroad . 
&quot; The American administration has shown understanding but certain circles in America are assessing ( the deal ) negatively , &quot; he said . 
Washington said earlier this month it would slap sanctions on companies investing more than $ 40 million in energy projects in Iran and Libya , calling them &quot; two supporters of terrorism . 
already , the the United States has condemned the Turkey-Iran deal but said last week it was too early to decide whether to punish NATO ally Turkey . 
Erbakan , the first Islamic leader in Turkey , a secular state with an overwhelmingly Moslem population , was in Iran at the start of his trip when the two countries signed the deal . 
&quot; We want to improve all kinds of relations with both the East and the West , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This sincere desire was openly expressed on our visit . 
&quot; He also visited Pakistan , Singapore and Malaysia and Indonesia . 
under the gas deal , a pipeline is to be built from the Iranian city of Tabriz to Ankara beginning in 1999 . 
Turkey , facing an energy shortage , will buy a total of 190 billion cubic metres by the year 2022 . 
Erbakan &apos;s visit to predominantly Moslem countries fulfilled a pledge after coming to power late in June to strengthen ties with Turkey &apos;s Moslem neighbours , who he said have been neglected in the past at the expense of relations with the West . 
trade agreements signed during the tour , many of them linked to defence projects , will be worth a potential $ 9 billion and will contribute towards correcting the country &apos;s sizeable trade deficit , he said . 
since coming to power , Erbakan has sought to maintain good relations with Turkey &apos;s NATO and European allies , easing earlier radical Islamist statements . 
the West also persuaded him to give his backing to the extension of a U.S.-led air force operation based in southern Turkey protecting Kurds in northern Iraq from attack by Baghdad . 
a fresh challenge to Turkey &apos;s northern Iraq policy confronted Erbakan on his return after reports of contacts between an Iraqi Kurdish group and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) . 
Turkish officials say PKK rebels use northern Iraq as a base to launch attacks on southern Turkey . 
Erbakan said Turkey was ready to work with all its neighbours to eradicate rebel activities . 
he said agreement had been reached with Tehran during his visit to prevent PKK border incursions from Iran .
