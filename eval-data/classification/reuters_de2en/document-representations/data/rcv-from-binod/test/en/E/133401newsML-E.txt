a deteriorating trade balance and the government &apos;s inability to narrow the budget deficit have cast a shadow over the growth outlook for the Brazilian economy in 1997 , tge financial daily Gazeta Mercantil reported . 
in a front-page story citing local analysts , Gazeta said the Brazilian economy -- which is expected to grow between 2.5 and 3 percent this year -- was unlikely to expand more than 4 percent in 1997 . 
the newspaper said the 1997 trade balance should post a deficit of between $ 5 to $ 6 billion , well above the $ 3.5 billion forecast for 1996 . 
meanwhile next year &apos;s public sector operational deficit should not improve significantly vis-a-vis 1996 , which government officials are reluctantly admitting will be of around 3.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product . 
the operational deficit is the shortfall between expenditures and revenues excluding capital items . 
Gazeta said inflation would be the government &apos;s only positive indicator with 1997 wholesale prices increasing around 6 percent and consumer prices rising on the order of 8 percent . 
&quot; It may be that the Real Plan &apos;s logic calls for restricted growth , &quot; said Sao Paulo University professor Eduardo Giannetti da Fonseca who forecast a 1997 growth rate of 2 percent . 
&quot; The Brazilian economy will not be taking off in 1997 , &quot; former Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega was quoted as saying . 
DA Nobrega forecast a growth rate of between 3 to 4 percent in 1997 .
