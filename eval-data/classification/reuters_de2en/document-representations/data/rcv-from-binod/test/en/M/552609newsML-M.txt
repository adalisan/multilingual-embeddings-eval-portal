the Philippine Central Bank said on Wednesday it had decided to leave its overnight borrowing rate unchanged at 10.25 percent . 
Bank traders had speculated the Central Bank might be forced to raise its rate to defend the peso because of possible large outflows of foreign funds after the stock market tumbled to a two-year low on Tuesday . 
&quot; They &apos;d ( the Central Bank ) rather not add to the knee-jerk reaction in the foreign exchange market . 
they &apos;re there to give stability . 
they &apos;ve been successful so far , &quot; a foreign bank dealer said . 
the Central Bank , however , raised its rate on the three-month special series Treasury bill rate to 10.30 percent from 10.20 percent . 
traders said this was just intended to align the bills with the current T-bill rates .
