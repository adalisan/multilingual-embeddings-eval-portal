President Bill Clinton on Tuesday signed a landmark treaty that bans all nuclear testing and called on the global community to get tougher on terrorists and drug traffickers . 
using the 51st session of the U.N. General Assembly to sketch out his U.S. election-year vision of global security and prosperity , Clinton said nations needed to cooperate against terrorism and illegal drugs because no country was immune from these menaces . 
&quot; Last year , I asked the nations assembled here to commit to a goal of zero tolerance for agresssion , terrorism and lawless behaviour . 
frankly , we haven &apos;t done that yet , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Real zero tolerance means giving no aid and no quarter to terrorists who slaughter the innocent and drug traffickers who poison our children and to do everything we can to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands . 
in a move that highlighted his determination to combat drugs , and that could help blunt Republican charges that he is weak on the issue , Clinton said he would provide &quot; more than $ 100 million worth of defence equipment , services and training &quot; to help America &apos;s southern neighbours fight drugs . 
the White House said he had notified Congress on Sept . 14 and that the money would provide helicopters , patrol boats and other equipment to Mexico , Colombia , Peru , Venezuela and other countries . 
Clinton addressed the U.N. delegates after making the United States the first signatory of the new Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , which is designed to end nuclear explosions in the atmosphere , underground or anywhere else . 
he signed the pact , which is expected to face a tough fight for ratification in the U.S. Senate next year , with the same pen President John Kennedy used to sign a limited test ban treaty in 1963 . 
&quot; This Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will help to prevent the nuclear powers from developing more advanced and more dangerous weapons . 
it will limit the ability of other states to acquire such devices themselves . 
it points us toward a century in which the roles and risks of nuclear weapons can be further reduced and ultimately eliminated , &quot; Clinton said . 
some have complained that it does not mandate total nuclear disarmament by a date certain . 
I would say to them do not forsake the benefits of this achievement by ignoring the tremendous progress we have already made toward that goal . 
this was a veiled message to India , which exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and now vows to block the treaty from taking effect . 
India maintains the pact is flawed because it does not commit the nuclear powers to destroy their arsenals and allows them to develop more sophisticated means of testing without explosions . 
Clinton coupled his praise for the test ban treaty with a call for action on six follow-on arms control steps including implementing a chemical weapons treaty , freezing the production of nuclear bomb-making material , improving compliance with a biological weapons treaty and banning antipersonnel landmines . 
in doing so , he took an indirect swipe at Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole , who two weeks ago abruptly withdrew his support for the chemical weapons treaty , dooming U.S. ratification this year . 
&quot; I deeply regret that the United States Senate has not yet voted on the convention , but I want to assure you and people throughout the world that I will not let this treaty die , &quot; Clinton told the delegates . 
his visit to U.N. headquarters was flavored by his vow to bar Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali from winning a second five-year term . 
the two posed for pictures soon after the president &apos;s arrival but the atmosphere was politely correct rather than warm and U.S. officials said there would be no compromise on the ouster move . 
&quot; Our biggest gripe against the secretary-general is , frankly , his lack of enthusiasm for reform . 
we don &apos;t feel that you should have a secretary-general of the U.N. going into the 21st century who has to dragged kicking and screaming into doing reform , &quot; Clinton aide Richard Clarke said . 
Clinton glossed over the controversy in his speech , saying only that his administration favoured &quot; streamlining the bureaucracy and reining in the budget &quot; of the United Nations and was committed to paying past-due U.S. financial obligations to the world body .
