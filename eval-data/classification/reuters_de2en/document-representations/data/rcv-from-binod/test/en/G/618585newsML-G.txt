China said on Tuesday that a disputed shoal in the South China Sea was its territory and that the Philippines should stop violating Chinese sovereignty . 
China relayed the message during a meeting in Beijing on Monday between visiting Philippines Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rodolfo Severino and his Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan , the official People &apos;s Daily said . 
&quot; The Huang Yan Islands are inherently Chinese territory , &quot; the newspaper quoted Tang as telling Severino during annual consultations between the foreign ministries of the two countries . 
the Philippines calls the Huang Yan islands Scarborough shoal . 
&quot; The Chinese side asks the Philippine side to respect history , to respect facts and to respect ... international laws and stop as soon as possible all actions violating China &apos;s territory , &quot; Tang said . 
&quot; The Chinese side refuted the unreasonable advocacy of the Philippine side by citing historical and legal facts and through reasoning , &quot; the People &apos;s Daily said . 
located 200 km ( 125 miles ) west of Subic freeport near Manila , the shoal is a 16 km ( 10 mile ) long rock formation which almost entirely vanishes at high tide , except for an outcrop big enough to accommodate just 12 people . 
the tone of Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen who met Severino later on Monday was softer . 
Qian said problems between neighbouring countries could &quot; eventually be resolved through dialogue , mutual understanding and restraint &quot; . 
last week , Philippine President Fidel Ramos publicly repudiated Beijing &apos;s ownership of the shoal after an hour-long meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing . 
Philippine military officials say the shoal has served in recent years mainly as a transit point for small boats carrying smugglers and their contraband to the Philippines &apos; main island of Luzon in the north . 
with an unclear economic value , the shoal appears an odd prize for a contest between an Asian giant sitting on a huge land mass and a neighbour with more than 7,000 islands of its own . 
China earlier this month warned it was exercising &quot; extreme restraint &quot; and protested against the flying of the Philippine flag on the shoal , calling it a &quot; serious violation &quot; of its sovereignty and demanding the flag &apos;s immediate removal .
