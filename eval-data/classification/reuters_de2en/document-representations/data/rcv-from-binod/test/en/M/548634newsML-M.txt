June Bund futures traded on LIFFE will continue to seek direction on Tuesday but will be constrained to the upside by areas of congestion up to 101.05 , technical analysts said . 
&quot; The market has no inspiration at the moment , &quot; said Marc Ostwald , technical strategist at London Bond Broking here . 
&quot; potentially we could have a small upside bias to start with . 
&quot; But even above initial congestion at 100.52-55 the market was set to run into another area of congestion around 100.74 and 100.78 , he said . 
Ostwald said he did not see the contract getting much beyond 100.78 but if it did , the highs from April 16 and 24 at 101.02 and 101.05 would cap trade for this session . 
he said to the downside initial support came in at the lows for the previous two sessions at 100.29 and 100.28 . 
&quot; We are close to 6.0 percent levels on the new 10-year Bund and that seems to be supporting the market , &quot; Ostwald said . 
fundamentals were adding to the lacklustre tone in all the debt markets , as players awaited the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday . 
but with little domestic data for Germany , Bunds were seeking direction , he said . 
technical analysts at a European bank in London said the reverse head and shoulders pattern still looked bullish and would only fail below 99.70 . 
that level was the low on April 14 and the high on April 1 . 
&quot; Bunds have remained uninspired , but we continue to look for a push to 101.60 in due course , &quot; they said in a research note , adding that initial resistance was at 100.74 with a further barrier at 101.12 , 101.13 . 
at the short end , June Euromark futures were unchanged at 96.74 . 
the European bank analysts said there was scope for a push higher to the low 96.80s.
