Indonesia is said to be negotiating to buy up to 180,000 tonnes of corn for last quarter delivery over fears that a drought caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon may hit the crop in Java , traders said on Thursday . 
&quot; Some of the Indonesians are beginning to take positions and are asking for quotes . 
they &apos;re looking to buy between 150,000 to 180,000 tonnes of corn because the local crop is hurting from a drought caused by El Nino , &quot; a senior trader told Reuters . 
traders said the lowest recent offers the Indonesians received for U.S. corn for October / December shipment ranged between $ 123- $ 124 a tonne C &amp; F. 
but regional dealers quoted U.S. corn coming into Southeast Asia for September / October shipment on a Panamax slightly higher at around $ 126- $ 128 a tonne C &amp; F after corn futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) rose overnight . 
drought is beginning to pose a threat to the corn crop on Java and some dealers were apprehensive on whether this is linked to El Nino . 
experts in Indonesia have said the dry weather is seasonal and is not linked to El Nino . 
EL Nino can wreak havoc with weather patterns around the Asia-Pacific rim when unusually warm ocean temperatures develop off the western coast of South America . 
the most severe El Nino in recent memory took place in 1983 and caused blistering drought in Indonesia , South Africa , the Philippines and Australia while triggering floods in India and severe winter storms in California . 
scientists have said the current El Nino , which is said to be the strongest since 1983 , is likely to peak in December . 
&quot; The El Nino effect on ... Indonesia is worrying . 
Java has not gotten much rain , &quot; a grains analyst said . 
even though corn prices are trending lower , drought in Indonesia and dry conditions in China &apos;s grain-growing provinces may eventually stop the slide in Chicago futures prices . 
&quot; If it &apos;s hot and dry during pollination in China in the last week of July and early August , the corn crop can get zapped very easily . 
there won &apos;t be a Chinese corn programme to speak of if that happens , &quot; one dealer said . 
buyers from Thailand and Malaysia are not expected to enter the market anytime soon , dealers said . 
&quot; You can forget Malaysia . 
they have too much corn and too much soymeal . 
they will not be in for the next two months , &quot; a trader said . 
Thai buyers , on the other hand , were waiting for a decision from the Commerce Ministy on whether to allow the duty-free importation of 100,000 tonnes of corn . 
&quot; The Thai business is going very slowly , &quot; a dealer said . 
most of the trade is keeping a close watch on what looks like a bumper U.S. corn and soybean crop . 
traders said , however , that some people will be tempted to buy soon given the potential problems crops may face from El Nino in China , Indonesia and Australia . 
&quot; The crop in the U.S. looks good , but there are a few speed bumps along the way , &quot; one dealer said .
