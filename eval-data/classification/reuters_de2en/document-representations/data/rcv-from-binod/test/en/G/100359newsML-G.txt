the Delhi High Court delayed until Monday afternoon a hearing on a request by former Indian prime minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao for legal protection against arrest in a forgery case , court officials said . 
last Friday , a lower court issued a warrant for Rao &apos;s arrest in the seven-year-old case . 
the former Congress party leader immediately requested anticipatory , or pre-emptive , bail , which would protect him against arrest . 
if the High Court denies Rao &apos;s request for anticipatory bail , he could be detained and put in either judicial or police custody pending trial . 
but Rao was expected to appeal to the Supreme Court if anticipatory bail was denied . 
the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) claims Rao was part of a conspiracy in 1989 to use forged documents to defame a rival politician . 
Rao has not commented publicly on the case .
