COMEX copper futures ended slightly higher Thursday , with LME copper prices little changed , as the market continued digesting last week &apos;s rally to new eight-month highs . 
&quot; The copper market may need a little clean out on the downside , but Chinese buying should emerge again later in the year , &quot; Merrill Lynch commodities research director , Bill O &apos;Neill said . 
COMEX May copper ended up 0.50 cent at 109.40 cents a pound , after finding support again around 108.00 cents and trading a 108.20-110.40 cent range . 
the COMEX May / July backwardation widened to 3.60 cents from 3.10 cents Wednesday , but the LME cash-to-three months spread slipped below $ 50.00 a tonne , to its lowest level since last October . 
in addition , Chinese copper stocks are seen sufficient for the next few months , meaning the State Reserve Bureau is unlikely to be a buyer in the short term , analysts said . 
the official China Business Weekly said Sunday China amassed a stockpile in 1996 of 170,000 tonnes of copper which would be used to fill the domestic supply / demand gap in 1997 . 
the paper estimated Chinese demand in 1997 at 1.2 million tonnes with domestic production at 900,000 tonnes and imports of 130,000 tonnes forecast .
