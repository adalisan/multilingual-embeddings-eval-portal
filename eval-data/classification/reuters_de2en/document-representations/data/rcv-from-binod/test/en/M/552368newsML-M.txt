Thailand &apos;s stock exchange ( SET ) index has further to slide , but it is unlikely to fall to 1982 levels , ING Barings said in its weekly report . 
&quot; We maintain our view that investors should at least wait for more data on the economy to come out before buying , &quot; said ING Barings research analyst Sanyalaksna Manibhandu . 
between 1991 and 1996 the SET was capped at 21.6 times earnings and found support at about 14.2 times earnings , he said . 
the market price-to-earnings ( per ) multiple is currently cheaper than its five-year mean , which indicates the SET has not hit the floor yet , he said . 
&quot; Because the current crisis is mostly an economic one , it will take longer to unwind , and the longer the ongoing process of getting back to equilibrium in financial markets takes , the more the stock market is exposed to the potential for further weakness , &quot; he said . 
the last time the Thai economy ran into a set of problems similar to those at present was in 1981 / 84 . 
then , as now , high inflation and a widening current account deficit caused the Bank of Thailand to tighten liquidity by capping credit extension . 
this , in turn , put pressure on borrowers and subsequently the stability of the entire financial system . 
historical price-to-earnings multiples from 1982 to 1996 , based on SET index levels , show that despite its drop since the fourth quarter of 1996 , the SET has yet to reach its 14-year low of 6.5 times per seen in 1982 , he said . 
&quot; Applying the same per multiple to our current market EPS forecast for 1997 yields a hypothetical SET index level of 447.5 , which although we do not expect to see in this cycle , does put the current stock market decline into perspective . 
another key valuation statistic , market capitalisation to gross domestic product , also remains above the 14-year average . 
&quot; As long as foreign premium remains at the top end of the range , foreign investors are not likely to rush back until there are clear signs of an impending economic recovery , &quot; Manibhandu said .
