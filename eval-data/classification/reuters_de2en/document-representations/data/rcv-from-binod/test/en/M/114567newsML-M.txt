OLOs were expected to take Tuesday &apos;s exchange auction in their stride and focus on U.S. CPI data on Wednesday , dealers said on Monday . 
&quot; The market will weaken , as usual , before the auction , but it &apos;s not going to do much . 
we &apos;ll have another quiet day , &quot; one said . 
the Treasury is offering OLOs 15 ( May 1997 ) and 8 ( August 1997 ) for OLOs 11 ( July 1998 ) , 13 ( April 1999 ) , 7 ( June 2001 ) and the new OLO 26 ( March 2007 ) . 
the benchmark 2006 OLO failed to match the progress of its German equivalent near the close , causing the yield spread over Bunds to widen to eight basis points from six on Friday . 
the 2006 OL0 yield rose to 6.11 percent from 6.08 Friday . 
one trader said prices were just slightly affected by news late Friday from the National Bank that the Belgian economy grew by three percent in the second quater of 1996 compared with the first , or 1.5 percent year-on-year . 
most analysts forecast growth in 1996 of around 1.1 percent , although the government has forecast 1.5 percent . 
the decision by Belgium &apos;s highest court to take Jean-Marc Connerotte , the popular magistrate investigating a shocking case of child sex , kidnapping and murder , off the case , was not affecting the market , the trader noted . 
&quot; The decision could spark social unrest but the market is not taking this into account as yet , &quot; he said . 
traders said the middle of the yield curve had been fairly well supported . 
&quot; The curve has come slightly inward , &quot; one said . 
volume remained slim throughout the day , he said , with no direction from the U.S. bond market which was closed for the Columbus Day holiday .
