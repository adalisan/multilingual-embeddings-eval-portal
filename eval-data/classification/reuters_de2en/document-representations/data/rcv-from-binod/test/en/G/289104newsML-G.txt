Russian President Boris Yeltsin stepped up his country &apos;s opposition to NATO expansion in weekend talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , laying out a range of tough demands , Western diplomatic sources said on Monday . 
Yeltsin , raising the stakes on the most important security issue facing Europe this year , did so at his first meeting with a foreign leader since returning to the Kremlin last month after heart surgery . 
the Russian demands are certain to be opposed by most NATO members . 
Kohl said in Moscow after the talks that he was optimistic a solution could be found this year to the disagreement between NATO and Russia , as the alliance prepares to invite some of Moscow &apos;s former satellites to join the Western bloc . 
but the diplomatic sources said Yeltsin had used the talks to push an even harder line from Moscow , which says NATO expansion is a threat to its own security . 
the sources said Yeltsin wanted a legally-binding commitment to involve Russia in formal consultations with NATO on any issue it felt affected its security -- including enlargement . 
this would give Moscow huge influence over alliance decisions and worry Eastern European states which fear Russia could block NATO &apos;s further enlargement . 
NATO is expected at a summit in July to invite some countries from Central and Eastern Europe to join the alliance , with Poland , Hungary and the Czech republic the frontrunners . 
&quot; The Russians are playing for very high stakes , &quot; said one source , who asked not to be identified . 
&quot; Any hope that Yeltsin &apos;s return would mean a more reasonable approach seems not to be justified . 
we face a difficult time ahead ... What they want is a full seat at the table , effectively the right of co-decision . 
Yeltsin told Kohl that this mechanism for consultations had to be set up before Moscow could consider any change in its opposition to NATO enlargement , the sources said . 
to underline the point , Yeltsin called top officials to a meeting on Monday to restate their collective opposition to the plans drawn up by Moscow &apos;s former Cold War foe . 
Yeltsin also told Kohl there could be no expansion of NATO &apos;s military structures to new members , the sources said . 
the alliance has already said it has no plans to station nuclear weapons on the territory of new members , but it may still want to station some troops , headquarters or other military installations there . 
&quot; That will be a matter between NATO and the new members . 
it will not be for Russia to decide , &quot; said another Western envoy . 
NATO allies have agreed to offer Russia a special relationship of some kind to ease Moscow &apos;s security concerns , probably in the form of a charter which would lay out plans for regular consultation . 
but the alliance insists Russia cannot hold a veto over NATO decisions . 
what is on offer from the alliance would be politically important , but not legally binding as Moscow wants . 
NATO allies have suggested topics such as peacekeeping and nuclear security as topics for discussion in the new forum with Russia . 
but they want to keep enlargement out of the discussion . 
there are differences among the allies over how exactly the new forum with Russia will work , although there is agreement that it must be ready in time for the July summit in Madrid when NATO announces its expansion plans . 
Germany , Russia &apos;s biggest ally within NATO , has pushed harder than any other Western country for formal and substantial cooperation with Russia , insisting that Moscow &apos;s views must be taken into account . 
diplomats said it was significant that Yeltsin had chosen to give the message to Kohl , his closest ally in Europe . 
the United States suggested last year the idea of a formal NATO-Russian charter but diplomats say Washington and many other allies are wary of giving the Russians too much real influence . 
&quot; This approach by the Russians is to see how much further they can cause divisions within the alliance by taking a very hard line , &quot; said one diplomat . 
Kohl said after the talks he had discussed some ideas with Yeltsin that he would now take up with other Western leaders , including U.S. President Bill Clinton . 
he gave no details .
