activity is expected to remain thin as many players got an early start on the long Memorial Day weekend . 
the American Cotton Shippers &apos; Association meeting this weekend will also keep a lid on activity . 
technically , a close above 73.00 cents in July could provide incentive for prices to move higher next week , but a lack of news and a balanced technical picture could keep the market within its recent range , analysts said . 
support was pegged at 71.90 cents in July . 
Thursday , the benchmark July contract closed up 0.49 cent at 72.61 cents , having ranged from 72.80 to 72.42 cents . 
New-crop December ended 0.33 cent firmer at 74.85 cents . 
an estimated 6,000 lots changed hands on the day .
