a European security mission , seeking to mediate in the armed rebellion in southern Albania , held talks on Saturday with the country &apos;s President Sali Berisha . 
former Austrian leader Franz Vranitzky , leading the mission of the Vienna-based Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , also held talks with opposition politicians who backed Berisha on Thursday in offering a halt to the government offensive against the rebels if they turned in their weapons . 
the former Austrian chancellor told Reuters he had &quot; very extensive &quot; talks with the right-wing Albanian leader , and held out the possibility of another meeting later in the day . 
the OSCE mission was the latest in a series of Western initiatives to end the crisis in Albania , Europe &apos;s poorest country , sparked by popular anger over fraudulent pyramid saving schemes . 
reports from the south indicated the situation was still volatile , with gunmen in the rebel-held port of Sarende firing in the air to drive off crowds trying to board a ferry bound for Greece . 
Vranitzky &apos;s mission appeared in trouble earlier this week when he acknowledged that Albanian officials had told him he was not welcome in the Balkan country . 
his visit to Tirana followed that of Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo , representing the European Union presidency , who urged Berisha to refrain from violence .
