the premium on Russia &apos;s biggest oil company NK LUKOIL over other Russian oil groups is justified and its shares should be bought as a prudent long-term investment , Moscow brokerage Troika-Dialog said . 
LUKOIL is overpriced compared to other Russian vertically integrated firms , it said in a research note . 
&quot; The LUKOIL premium , however , continues to appear justified in view of its superior liquidity and its status as leader of the pack in the Russian oil world , &quot; it said . 
LUKOIL has managed to strike a good balance between upstream and downstream operations , it said . 
conversion of all subsidiaries into one corporate entity should be completed by late 1996 , enabling LUKOIL to better manage existing subsidiaries and control its financial position . 
a uniquely close relationship with federal and local governments has enabled LUKOIL to stand in for the Russian government in certain international contracts , and establish exploration and production joint ventures and service stations internationally , it said . 
&quot; Its increasingly formalised alliance with Arco ( Atlantic Richfield Co ) will provide it with access to both technology and the necessary finance , &quot; it said . 
unlike most Russian oil companies , LUKOIL is charactersied by a refreshingly open attitude towards foreign and domestic investors , resulting in a high level of transparency . 
LUKOIL is undervalued against international peers , and substantial performance can be expected in line with the development of domestic capital markets . 
&quot; It remains a benchmark stock for the market and the quintessential Russian blue chip , &quot; Troika said . 
as of October 11 , LUKOIL had outperformed the MT index with one , six and 12-month changes of 17 , 69 and 89 percent respectively against index rises of 10 , 68 and 72 percent .
