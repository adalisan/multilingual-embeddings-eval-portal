Madrid share indices ended higher on Tuesday after a choppy day &apos;s trade , influenced by thin volume and weakness in other markets , dealers said . 
the general index added 2.84 points , 0.49 percent , to 586.56 and the ibex rose 38.58 points , 0.58 percent , to 6,664.43 . 
Repsol rose 110 pesetas to 6,210 ahead of first half results due Wednesday , for which forecasts point to a net profit decline of at most nine percent . 
the shares were recouping after a period of weakness , traders said . 
a dealer at a foreign house said final investors , probably from the U.S. , were switching out of Endesa and into Iberdrola after both announced Latin American deals last week . 
Endesa shed 55 pesetas to 3,075 while Iberdrola gained 55 pesetas to 1,815 . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty clear there was switching from one to the other , but the surprising thing was that the Endesa offered was being taken up really well . 
overall , the market is still weak and may slip further , amid concerns about rising German money rates , dealers said .
