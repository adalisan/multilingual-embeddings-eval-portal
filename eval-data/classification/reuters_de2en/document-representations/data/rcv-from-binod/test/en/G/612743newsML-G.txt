Czech President Vaclav Havel cast doubt over planned changes in the cabinet during a regular radio broadcast on Sunday . 
this situation must be seriously considered and analysed , and policy aims must be articulated , &quot; Havel told Czech Radio in an interview recorded on Saturday morning . 
Havel stressed that under the constitution it was the President who appointed and dismissed ministers . 
but he was not asked whether this meant he would not accept any resignations made by ministers , and it was not clear what effect this would have on the three resignations announced on Saturday . 
industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy , Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and Interior Minister Jan Ruml announced their resignations during separate talks being held by the leaderships of the three-party ruling coalition . 
the talks , aimed at shoring up the government &apos;s position which has been shaken by worsening economic results , were also continuing on Sunday . 
the resignation of the whole government would be a cleaner , if less practical , solution , Havel said , but added that he thought the current government should continue governing . 
individual ministers could be dismissed , but not before the situation was thoroughly considered , he said . 
&quot; It is simply nonsense ... it creates an impression that a crowd of people are standing in the street and calling for the government to be thrown out of the window , and the government panics and agrees who to throw out , &quot; Havel said .
