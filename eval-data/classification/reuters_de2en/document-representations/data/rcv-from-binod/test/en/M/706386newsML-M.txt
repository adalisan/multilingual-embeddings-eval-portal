new Zealand financial markets were barely changed from their early levels on Thursday shortly after the central bank said monetary conditions had eased too far , but the dollar appeared to be firming marginally 
on its Trade-Weighted Index the kiwi was at 66.47 , flat with its 66.47 at the open and up from the 66.28 just before the announcement . 
Ninety-day bank bills were equally sluggish in their response . 
they were at 7.10 percent from 7.03 percent at the open . 
volumes were large in the bank bill futures , with the September contract weakening 13 basis points to 92.90 with 6,738 contracts traded . 
the September contract had opened at 92.96 . 
&quot; actual monetary conditions have been too easy over recent days . 
we will be looking to see actual conditions settle clower to the announced desired levels , &quot; RBNZ governor Don brash said . 
the RBNZ in its Monetary Policy Statement on Friday assumed conditions on the MCI would average 825 over the September quarter , but it also said it would be comfortable if conditions moved about 50 basis points on either side of that average .
