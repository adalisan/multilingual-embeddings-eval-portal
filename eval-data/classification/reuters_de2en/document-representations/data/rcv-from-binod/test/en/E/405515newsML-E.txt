an interest rate cut is &quot; imminent &quot; in Malaysia following the slowdown in domestic demand and improvement in its external trade sector , Jardine Fleming International Securities said in a research note on Wednesday . 
&quot; The sharp improvement in the external sector has refocused investors &apos; attention on the possibility of lower interest rates in the months ahead ... given the slowdown in domestic demand and the improvement in the external sector , an interest rate cut is imminent , &quot; the research paper said . 
on Tuesday , Malaysia reported that its trade deficit shrank to 617.97 million ringgit in 1996 from 9.36 billion in 1995 . 
the brokerage house said worries about strong import growth this year were overblown . 
&quot; &apos; lumpy &apos; imports fell 32.8 percent year-on-year in 1996 , and we continue to believe that concerns about the sharp rebound in import growth are overblown , &quot; it said . 
Jardine Fleming said Malaysia will continue to benefit from the ringgit &apos;s appreciation against the Japanese yen . 
&quot; There is normally a time lag of about 3-5 months for the effect of currency changes to filter through to the trade figures , &quot; the report said . 
the ringgit surged from 2.4732 / 54 per 100 yen at end-1995 , to 2.1767 / 95 at end-1996 . 
the Malaysian currency has continued its rise this year , closing at 2.0305 / 30 at the end of Tuesday trading in Kuala Lumpur . 
the brokerage said the increase in the trade surplus with countries other than Japan despite the slowdown in Malaysia &apos;s electronics exports showed Kuala Lumpur is importing less from these countries . 
&quot; slower growth in imports from these countries means that domestic demand is easing , &quot; the report added .
