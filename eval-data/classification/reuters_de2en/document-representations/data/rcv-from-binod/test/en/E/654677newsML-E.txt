Bangladesh expects to gain new trade opportunities through its membership in an economic grouping of eight Islamic countries of Asia and Africa to be launched in Turkey next week . 
a foreign office spokesman said on Wednesday Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would leave on Saturday for Istanbul to attend the June 15 summit , at which leaders of the eight countries are to adopt a declaration for the Developing-8 bloc . 
&quot; The group is aimed at expansion of trade and cooperation in a variety of fields . 
Bangladesh will be a big beneficiary , &quot; State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury told Reuters recently . 
the other sponsors are Turkey , Iran , Indonesia , Malaysia , Pakistan , Nigeria and Egypt . 
&quot; The group will foster a new horizon of mutual cooperation for socio-economic upliftment of 800 million people of the eight member countries , &quot; the Bangladesh Observer newspaper on Wednesday quoted Chowdhury as telling reporters . 
a foreign ministry official said Dhaka was looking for smoother transit facilities to central Asia and European markets . 
&quot; More trade and technical assistance are likely with the group members , but transit through Iran and Turkey will be a big gain for our international trade , &quot; said the official . 
the private sector seemed less enthusiastic , and some business leaders even expressed ignorance about the D-8 . 
&quot; I am not sure how the group with member countries scattered at such huge distances will be beneficial to Bangladesh . 
proximity is a big factor in trade grouping , &quot; said Shamsud Doha , vice-president of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) Chamber . 
SAARC comprises Bangladesh , Bhutan , India , Maldives , Nepal , Pakistan and Sri Lanka . 
&quot; I am not also sure whether tying up with only Islamic countries at all bears any significance when other Islamic blocs are in doubt as far as their effectiveness is concerned , &quot; Doha said . 
Bangladesh officials said the D-8 would remain open to non-Islamic countries . 
however , Mabubur Rahman , president of the Bangladesh chapter of the International Chamber of Commerce ( ICC ) , said likely tariff benefits would help exporters to penetrate new markets . 
&quot; Cooperation in any form is always better than non-cooperation . 
we could have very effective cooperation with many of the group members like Malaysia , Turkey and Iran , &quot; Rahman said . 
officials said the draft declaration of the Istanbul summit had identified 30 areas , including trade , technology , transit , air links and rural development , for cooperation .
