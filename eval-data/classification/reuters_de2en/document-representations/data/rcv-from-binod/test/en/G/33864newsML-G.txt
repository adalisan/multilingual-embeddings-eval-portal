Andre Agassi scored a knockout of a win over Thomas muster in a battle of baseline heavyweights at the U.S. Open Wednesday . 
the sixth-seeded Agassi held off the tenacious third-seeded Austrian with a barrage of winners for a 6-2 7-5 4-6 6-2 victory and a semifinal berth in his country &apos;s championship for the sixth time . 
&quot; I knew with his style of play and my style of play that it was gong to be important to be nothing but mentally committed to running for every ball and really playing a high level of tennis , &quot; Agassi said after the two hour , 32 minute slugging match . 
the collision of tennis titans filled the National Tennis Centre stadium to its last row . 
Agassi spent most of the match parked comfortably on the baseline , controlling the points by rifling his groundstrokes from corner to corner . 
&quot; One thing Thomas does well is that he likes to dictate play . 
the one thing that I had to do was definitely get on the offence , &quot; said Agassi , who rifled 48 winners to just 27 for muster . 
&quot; If I can dictate the play he is not as comfortable on the defence . 
muster was pinned yards beyond the basleine and while he tirelessly ran down scores of balls , he only rarely was able to wrestle away control of the point . 
&quot; He was playing inside the court and I was pushed back and I am usually the one that is dominating the game and he dominated me today , &quot; said muster , who also dropped his serve 10 times . 
after being flattened in the opening two sets , muster got off the canvas to battle back from 0-2 to take the third set . 
muster led for the first time since the opening game of the match when Agassi dropped his serve on a double fault at 3-3 . 
the Austrian held for 5-3 and then served out the set from 0-30 . 
&quot; You can point out guys who are not going to give up -- ( Jimmy ) Connors , muster , ( Michael ) Chang would come to mind , &quot; said Agassi . 
&quot; There are a few guys who have that kind of intensity match after match and I think muster has that intensity . 
&quot; He never loses for lack of effort and there is a lot to respect in that . 
but any momentum that muster had on his side was washed away when a few sprinkles of rain forced officials to stop play after Agassi held serve to start the last set . 
though the palyers never left the court and were back playing in five minutes , the respite seeed to be just what Agassi needed to energise a final winning spurt . 
&quot; That could have been a turning point , &quot; said muster , who fell behind 3-0 before holding serve . 
&quot; He got four , five minutes to relax again to think about what he has to do and he came strongly . 
said Agassi : &quot; It did lend itself to a good jump start there . 
the two traded barbs throughout the year , and the friction heightened the atmosphere surrounding this clash above any of their previous eight meetings , which they had split 4-4 . 
muster was one of the most vocal critics of the Open &apos;s decision to elevate Agassi two spots in the seedings from his ATP ranking and drop the Austrian one spot from his ranking . 
on Tuesday muster had taken a few shots at Agassi &apos;s coach Brad Gilbert as being universally disliked on the tour . 
earlier in the year , Agassi questioned muster &apos;s legitimacy as the ranking number one since muster &apos;s climb in the rankings had bee due to his superiority on one surface clay . 
of his 41 career titles , muster has won 39 on clay . 
but muster made no more of the loss than any other defeat . 
&quot; Tomorrow this match is history for me , &quot; said the 28-year-old muster , who has has never gotten past the Open quarter-finals in eight tries . 
&quot; I don &apos;t care what he says about me or anybody else because it is not much meaning to me . 
for me it is a tennis match . 
Michael Chang is next for Agassi after the second-seeded American advanced to the semifinals for the first time in four years by turning back the spirited challenge of unseeded Spaniard Javier Sanchez 7-5 6-3 6-7 6-3 . 
&quot; Javier was playing some great tennis . 
it was definitely a dogfight , &quot; Chang said of the two hour , 49 minute Stadium court battle . 
the women &apos;s semifinal brackets were completed when , on the eve of her father &apos;s trial for tax evasion in Germany , top seed and defending champion Steffi Graf managed to put aside her personal problems to reach her 11th U.S. Open semifinal by beating unseeded Austrian Judith Wiesner 7-5 6-3 . 
I &apos;ll definitely have to work on that , &quot; said Graf , who herself remains under investigation by German authorities . 
Graf will next meet 16th-seeded Martina Hingis , the Swiss teen sensation who beat the Olympic bronze medallist and seventh seed Czech Jana Novotna 7-6 6-4 . 
Hingis is the third 15-year-old to reach the U.S. Open semifinals after Andrea Jaeger in 1980 and Jennifer Capriati in 1991 . 
I have nothing to lose against her , &quot; said Hingis , who handed Graf one of her three losses this year at the Italian Open , but fell to her at Wimbledon . 
the other semifinal on Friday will feature second-seeded Monica Seles and fourth seed Conchita Martinez of Spain , who advanced on Tuesday .
