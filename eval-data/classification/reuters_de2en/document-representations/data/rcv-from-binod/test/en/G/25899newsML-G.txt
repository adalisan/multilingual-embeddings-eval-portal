a new guerrilla group in Mexico is likely to be a far greater military threat to the Mexican armed forces than the rebellion by Zapatista rebels in southern Chiapas state , analysts say . 
rebels of the leftist Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) stunned Mexicans on Aug . 28 by launching coordinated attacks in at least three states -- Oaxaca , Guerrero and the state of Mexico -- killing 14 people and wounding 20 . 
on Friday one soldier was killed and two were wounded after a group of 40 to 50 heavily armed men attacked a military convoy in the western state of Michoacan , media reports said . 
it was not clear if the Friday attack involved the EPR or drug traffickers . 
although no one believes the rebels would be a match for Mexico &apos;s approximately 150,000-strong army in head-on battle , the EPR seems versed in classic hit-and-run guerrilla tactics that will make it an elusive target . 
&quot; Fighting and fleeing . 
... Our mobility has not given the Mexican army an open front to attack , it has frustrated their battle plan , &quot; the rebels &apos; Commander Vicente said in a recent interview with Proceso magazine . 
a negative factor for the rebels may prove to be a lack of popular support . 
although many Mexicans dislike the government of President Ernesto Zedillo and have been hard hit by a recession , most are against violence and wary of the EPR &apos;s Marxist rhetoric . 
so far the EPR has lived up to its claims to be a highly mobile and well-armed group . 
it has made its presence known through attacks or propaganda acts in at least eight states in poorer areas of central and southern Mexico , officials said . 
by contrast , the Zapatista rebels who launched a 1994 rebellion were largely confined to one corner of the southernmost state of Chiapas . 
the Zapatistas are currently negotiating peace with the government . 
the Zapatistas are larger in numbers , but they are easier to control , because they are confined to a much smaller area , &quot; said Roderic Camp , an expert on the Mexican military at the University of Tulane . 
camp said Mexico &apos;s military might not be quick to resort to the &quot; dirty war &quot; tactics used by Latin American armed forces in the 1970s because of increased international attention on human rights . 
counterinsurgency efforts in several parts of Mexico will prevent the military from focusing on anti-drug efforts , which the U.S. government has pressed Mexico to pursue . 
&quot; The Mexican military is not big in numbers for the size of the country or its population . 
they will be pretty spread out if they have to hunt rebels in several states , &quot; Camp said . 
the EPR has a modern arsenal of assault rifles such as AK-47s , AR-15s and submachine guns , compared with the Zapatistas &apos; mostly ancient collection of rifles and guns , analysts said . 
officials suspect the new rebel group , which appeared two months ago in Guerrero , obtained money from kidnappings , including the high-profile abduction of a rich banker in 1994 that yielded a reported ransom of $ 5 million to $ 35 million .
