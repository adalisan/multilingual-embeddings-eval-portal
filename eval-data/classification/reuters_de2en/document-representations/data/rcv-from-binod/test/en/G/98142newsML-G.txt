opposition leader Chuan Leekpai , a front-runner for the Thai premiership after elections in November , sees an uphill battle for his Democrat Party in the polls with old-style money politics set to be its key foe . 
the soft-spoken , veteran politician told Reuters in an interview late on Friday that his party faced a tough fight in this election against opponents who were using millions of dollars to buy &quot; strong &quot; candidates and votes . 
&quot; In their attempt to get the most seats , political parties backed by some big businessmen are using lots of money to buy over MPs , regardless of quality , &quot; Chuan said . 
&quot; If votes are also bought and these politicians win , Thailand will be set back and be ruled by money politics . 
old problems will come back again , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Corruption has hit the civil service . 
those who pay money to politicians get promotions and nepotism is rife , &quot; he said . 
but prospects were good for the Democrats to emerge at the core of a new coalition government because more Thais and the mass media were rejecting such old-style politics , he said . 
&quot; There is more political awareness now against money politics , especially after what people saw happen in the last 14 months with the outgoing administration , &quot; Chuan said . 
the Democrat party hoped to win most seats with aid from a &quot; clean image &quot; and popular belief that it would be a viable alternative government armed with an array of new faces . 
traditionally , millions of dollars are spent by cash-rich Thai political parties ahead of candidate registration for elections to lure members of parliament with good chances of winning their seats to defect . 
registration for this election has been set for October 21 to 25 and party-hopping , closing down or mergers of parties has been the political vogue since outgoing Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa dissolved parliament last week . 
the secretary general of Banharn &apos;s Chart Thai party , Sanoh Tienthong , left with his faction to join the New aspiration Party ( NAP ) of Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh . 
Chavalit is tipped to be the other front-runner for the premiership by political analysts , but the former army chief has consistently failed in his bid to get the top post . 
the Democrats have formed a loose opposition alliance with four other parties . 
Banharn , whom the opposition accused of condoning corruption and economic mismanagement before he called the polls , is not seen as a big winner in the coming polls . 
Chuan &apos;s party , which won 86 of the 391 seats in parliament , has its base in southern Thailand . 
the party , seen as the champion of the poor and middle class , lost influence in the politically-important capital city of Bangkok , but is working hard to make a comeback . 
former lawyer Chuan has been in politics for the past 27 years and was prime minister from 1993-95 . 
his five-party government fell after a land reform scandal . 
the opposition charged then that a land scheme , intended to help poor farmers , was manipulated by some Democrats to benefit wealthy business associates in a southern province . 
but Chuan claimed the scandal surfaced after some errors were committed by certain civil servants and it was played up by some disloyal coalition partners who later withdrew their support for his administration . 
despite the setback , the 56-year-old Chuan said he was ready to become premier again . 
&quot; I am ready to accept the challenge of the responsibility ... even to become opposition leader again , &quot; he said .
