boxed beef trading was generally lower on good demand and heavy offerings this week , USDA said . 
good retail demand was noted for both immediate and forward interest . 
chuck and round cuts traded sharply lower throughout the week as inventories on these cuts were rather large and burdensome . 
loin cuts started the week on a firm note , but late in the week these cuts also encountered pressure , especially for mid-July deliveries . 
rib cuts , on the other hand , traded higher on the Select and Choice product as processors were in better position on these items . 
closely trimmed chuck and round cuts traded sharply lower on very good demand as these cuts were seen as good values . 
beef trimmings traded lower on light to moderate demand and offerings . 
fed cattle and blended coarse ground items traded uneven as product shipped for immediate needs traded higher , while post holiday needs traded mostly lower on light to moderate demand and offerings .
