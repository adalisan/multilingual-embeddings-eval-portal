Robert Giordano , senior vice president and treasurer of Bank Leumi Trust Co of New York , said the Federal Reserve may have to raise short-term interest rates another 25 to 50 basis points . 
&quot; Without a clear and immediate slowdown in the economy , I believe that additional Fed tightening of 25 to 50 basis points is likely , &quot; Giordano told the New York Institute of Credit at a recent conference here . 
&quot; Having now made the politically difficult first move , subsequent tightening by the Federal Reserve will be easier to initiate , although predicting future Fed policy actions is complex , &quot; he said . 
despite a robust economy , important inflationary indicators seem well behaved , Giordano said . 
a key determinant will be the April 29 results of the first quarter Employment Cost Index ( ECI ) , which includes both wage and benefit costs . 
he said that , if the first quarter ECI is above 0.9 percent , market rates &quot; will rise in anticipation of a tightening . 
&quot; But the sustained strength of the dollar should help mitigate the degree of any interest rate rises . 
&quot; A strong dollar now seems to be in everyone &apos;s best interest ... It should help lift the weak economies of our trading partners , while at the same time exert a drag on the U.S. export sector , &quot; Giordano added .
