American financier and philanthropist George Soros said on Friday that Ukraine was in dire need of a reformed tax system if it hoped to improve its economy . 
&quot; We have to create the environment where enterprises and economic activity can be conducted in the official economy , where taxation is not as oppressive , &quot; Soros told Reuters while visiting Ukraine for an economic conference . 
Soros , 66 , who emigrated from Hungary to England in 1947 and then to the U.S. in 1956 , made his fortune in his new home and since then has dedicated portions of his earnings to helping countries with emerging economies . 
he stressed the need to reduce regulations and licenses required to operate a business in Ukraine . 
&quot; Each time you have a license , it is a licence to extract money bribes from the people who have to get the licence , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s very important to reduce the amount of regulations , and then to reduce the level of taxation . 
Ukraine &apos;s unwieldy taxation system has at times resulted in businesses being taxed for 100 percent of profits , and has been blamed for the former Soviet republic &apos;s large shadow economy , estimated at up to 40 percent of all economic activity . 
President Leonid Kuchma promised this week to reform the tax system next year , which would include lower taxes and fewer regulations . 
&quot; Having a lower rate but more people paying it , that &apos;s really the task , &quot; said Soros . 
Soros , who has contributed millions of dollars to various charitable projects in Ukraine , said the country has made economic progress , such as bringing hyperinflation to heel . 
but he said it still faces large problems such as a shortage of energy resources and the money to pay for them , and the need to reduce government expenditures .
