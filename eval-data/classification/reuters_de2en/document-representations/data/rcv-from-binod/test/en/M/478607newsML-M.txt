Lithuanian shares slid on Tuesday and dealers said that short-term gains were not likely . 
overall central market volume was just over 1.1 million litas and the Litin A index fell 83.17 points to 2,523.80 . 
&quot; We had a full list today for the first time in a while as all of the shareholders &apos; meetings are over , and that affected the supply and demand ratio , &quot; said one dealer . 
other dealers said that investors were still examining the results of the meetings as they prepared to change their portfolios . 
many of the country &apos;s leading blue chip companies also failed to pay dividends and that has put buyers off a bit , dealers said . 
losers included Vilniaus Bank , which saw its preferntial shares fall ten percent to 207.00 litas from 230.00 litas in trade of only 828.00 litas . 
Ukio Bank &apos;s shares also dropped ten percent , easing to 15.39 litas from 17.10 litas in trade of 3,070 litas .

Lithuanian Gas fell to 2.14 litas from 2.30 litas and its shares turned over 15,000 litas . 
Lithuania Energy was one of the few gainers , advancing to 3.50 litas from 3.30 litas in relatively high trade of almost 320,000 litas .
