Singapore gas oil and jet fuel were steady on Tuesday in fairly active trade despite a big increase in overnight crude prices as bearish regional fundamentals weighed on the market , traders said . 
traders said the modest rise was due to talks that there are unsold prompt arbitrage cargoes totalling around 200,000 tonnes in Singapore . 
the talk of prompt cargoes seeking a home has narrowed the May / June swaps spread to flat while the June / June was cut to 20 cents from over 60 cents on Monday , brokers said . 
June gas oil swaps were last quoted at $ 25.20 / $ 25.30 per barrel up from Monday &apos;s $ 25.00 / $ 25.10 , brokers said . 
June traded in the morning at $ 25.50 and $ 25.55 before easing in the afternoon . 
in the physical market , two 150,000 barrel cargoes traded , one at $ 25.20 per barrel for May 28-June 1 lifting and the other at $ 25.40 for June 8-12 lifting , both on a free-on-board Singapore basis . 
both cargoes were sold by a Swiss trader to a Singapore trader , industry sources said . 
the deals were unchanged from Monday &apos;s $ 25.30 buying number and $ 25.25 and $ 25.40 selling price . 
jet fuel prices were also steady with one 100,000-barrel cargo traded between a U.S. major to a Singapore trader at $ 25.15 per barrel for June 8-12 lifting . 
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co sold by tender 25,000 tonnes of jet fuel for June 4-6 lifting at 10 cents per barrel above spot Middle East quotes on a free-on-board ( fob ) basis , down 10 cents from its previous sale , traders said . 
separately , traders said ADNOC had also sold on spot basis a similar sized jet fuel cargo for mid-June lifting at a premium of between 20-25 cents to a trader for export to India .
