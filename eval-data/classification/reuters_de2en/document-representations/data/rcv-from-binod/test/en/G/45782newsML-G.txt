Oklahoma City formally submitted a bid for a National Hockey League expansion franchise that would play in a new arena to be built downtown , city officials said on Wednesday . 
a $ 100,000 deposit was sent by the Oklahoma Sports Commission to the league , which this summer said it was seeking bids for expansion teams , said Clayton Bennett , an Oklahoma publisher and president of the sports commission . 
the hockey club would be the first major league sports franchise in Oklahoma . 
Oklahoma City voters in 1993 approved a five-year , one-cent sales tax to fund a series of downtown revitalization projects , including the 17,500-seat indoor sports arena for a professional hockey club . 
the city , wracked by the April 19 , 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in the heart of downtown , last week started a $ 2.7 million program promoting Oklahoma City as a site for corporate relocations .
