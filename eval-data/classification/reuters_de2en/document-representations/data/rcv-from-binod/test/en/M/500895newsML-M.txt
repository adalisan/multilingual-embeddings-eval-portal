the level of new Turkish share issues is straining the Istanbul stock market and threatens to drag the market lower , brokers said on Thursday . 
they said the share offerings were adding to the negative impact on the bourse of uncertainty in the political arena and concerns about the future of the economy . 
&quot; I would say that political uncertainties and new issues drawing money from the market are having a negative influence , &quot; said Erhan Topac , general manager at Gedik Securities . 
the IMKB National-100 closed at 1,514 , down 16 points , or 1.05 percent from Wednesday , but up sligthly from a late low of 1,500 . 
volume dropped to 17.49 trillion lira ( $ 133.5 million ) from Wednesday &apos;s 21.12 trillion ( $ 161.5 million ) . 
new issues this year , which have gathered pace in recent weeks , have attracted around six trillion Turkish lira of funds . 
but Topac said foreign investors were buying the majority of the new shares . 
the market , which gained strongly in the first two months of the year , has been weighed down since by doubts over the future of the Islamist-led coalition in the wake of a military-inspired demand to crack down on a rise in religious activism , brokers said . 
&quot; The month of April is generally positive in the market . 
the first reason for it not being that way this year is the political tensions , the second is that new issues are drawing money from the market , &quot; said Alp Tekince , deputy general manager at Bumerang Securities . 
Tekstilbank general manager Ertan Gungor shared the view that the current economic environment was not suitable for new issues . 
&quot; At this time the bourse cannot cope with this . 
there is a clear amount of money in the market . 
the market cannt cope with this at a time of great demand let alone at a time when the market is not active , &quot; Gungor said .
