the Bel-20 share index is expected to struggle in the near term amid a lack of reasons for players to buy , dealers said on Tuesday . 
&quot; The bourse will stay weak for now , &quot; a trader said . 
many players were absent due to school holidays , while the key event of the week -- the release of October U.S. jobs data -- would take place on Friday when the market is closed for All Saints . 
the index ended down 9.99 points at 1,802.02 , off a 1,793.65 intraday low , hit by Wall Street &apos;s nervous swings in the wake of U.S. data . 
players were wary after being caught out on Monday when the Dow Jones was up when the bourse closed . 
in the end the Dow Jones lost 34 points on Monday . 
by 1655 GMT on Tuesday it was unchanged after moving in a 40-point range . 
dealers said they felt they had also been misled by the foreign exchange markets . 
&quot; We thought the downtrend had been broken when we saw the dollar heading for 1.52 , 1.53 , 1.54 ( marks ) . 
one trader noted news that U.S. consumer confidence fell in October , including reduced consumer plans to buy housing and autos , had been positive in that it reduced upward pressure on interest rates , but negative for company earnings prospects . 
&quot; Those were not excellent figures for the bourse , &quot; said a trader , &quot; we saw sellers in the market . 
he added players would likely be nervous until after the U.S. presidential elections on November 5 . 
they would be seeking guidance on direction from Wall Street . 
dealers expected further profit-taking over the next few days in a bid to mark down prices to attractive levels . 
Bel-20 heavyweight PetroFina , which suffered from news late on Friday of disappointing results from its U.S. Fina unit , lost another 1.1 percent at 9,600 francs . 
on Monday it had already lost 90 francs . 
one analyst said that , internationally , the share was relatively dear . 
noting PetroFina was typically a downstream company and a buyer rather than a producer of raw material , he said refining margins remained tight due to high oil prices . 
Delhaize suffered notably from the dollar &apos;s weakness . 
it lost 1.9 percent at 1,790 . 
through its U.S. unit Food Lion it is heavily exposed to the dollar . 
holding company Ackermans &amp; van Haaren rose 140 at 4,980 on news of a 1.0 billion franc capital gain from a share swap between a unit and Houston contract drilling services provider Pride Petroleum Services Inc .
