Ethiopia &apos;s government has barred its diplomats travelling to Britain without permission , accusing British authorities of violating diplomatic privilege through searches , a foreign ministry official said on Monday . 
the Ethiopian official , who declined to be identified , confirmed to Reuters the substance of reports in Ethiopian newspapers citing a notice from the office of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi . 
it told officials &quot; not to travel or transit through Britain , because their ( British ) action violated diplomatic immunity and privileges enjoyed by officials bearing diplomatic passports &quot; . 
&quot; In the event that travel to Britain or transit through Britain becomes absolutely necessary , officials are instructed to get clearance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , &quot; the notice added . 
it said Ethiopia had repeatedly tried in vain to convince British authorities , which cited security concerns , not to subject holders of Ethiopian diplomatic passports to searches . 
Janet Duff , a spokeswoman at the British embassy in Addis Ababa , said the Vienna Convention excluded from searches diplomats accredited to an embassy in the country they were arriving in as well as diplomats accompanying a diplomatic bag or couriers . 
she said holders of diplomatic passports not accredited to a mission in Britain , not accompanying a diplomatic bag or who were not couriers could be searched under the convention . 
&quot; We regard airport security as a legitimate concern but abide conscientiously to the Vienna Convention , &quot; she added .
