Neil Back has been called into England &apos;s squad for this Saturday &apos;s Five Nations showdown with France as back-up for injured flanker Richard Hill . 
hill , picked to win his third cap against the French , sprained an ankle in training last week and missed his club Saracens &apos; cup tie last Sunday . 
&quot; Hill &apos;s ankle and Simon Shaw &apos;s shoulder will need treatment in the next day or so , but I am optimistic they will be fit , &quot; said England captain Phil de Glanville , also suffering from an ankle problem himself . 
back has not played for England since serving a six-month ban for pushing the referee after his club Leicester lost last season &apos;s English domestic cup final in May . 
Ireland have already had to reshuffle their pack to face Scotland . 
Nick Popplewell has withdrawn with a hamstring injury and will be replaced at loose-head prop by Paul Flavin of BlackRock College .
