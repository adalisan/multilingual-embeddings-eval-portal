the Russian central bank announced on Tuesday a slight easing in the conditions under which non-residents can invest in the government securities market . 
foreigners investing in government securities must buy roubles in special &quot; S &quot; accounts with Russian banks , from which they can repatriate profits through forwards and options deals . 
the central bank influences the overall yield in dollar terms available to non-residents by requiring the Russian banks operating the accounts to offset a proportion of the cash purchases and forward sales with it at non-market rates . 
from February 10 the proportion of these offsetting deals on cash purchases of roubles will fall to 50 percent from 65 percent . 
the proportion of offsetting deals on forward sales of roubles remains at 65 percent , and the minimum term for forwards and options remains two and four months respectively . 
the guaranteed dollar yield for non-residents purchasing forward currency contracts at the same time as the securities and holding the securities to maturity remains 12.5 percent . 
Russian central bank and finance ministry officials have said that non-residents will be given equal treatment on the government securities market by the end of the year .
