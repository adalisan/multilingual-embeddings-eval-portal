API , a refinery trade group in Washington D.C. , reported gasoline stocks fell 5.96 million barrels nationwide to 189.84 million barrels for the week ended October 18 . 
but after-hours trade turned light as dealers were unsure about the numbers . 
traders questioned the accuracy of data showing a sharp drop in PADD 2 gasoline and distillates stocks . 
the region showed a combined loss of eight million barrels for both products , with distillates falling 2.8 million barrels and gasoline off 5.2 million . 
Distillates defied analyst expectations and fell 17,000 barrels last week , but heavy builds in PADD 1 ( Petroleum Adminstration for Defense District ) took the bullish edge out of prices . 
&quot; The numbers could be construed as slightly bearish ... with a build in PADD 1 in distillates and builds in PADD 2 and 3 in crude , &quot; a traders said . 
Front-month gasoline traded 69.80 cents a gallon in early access after-hours trade , off 0.32 cent after settling up 1.20 cents at 69.12 . 
around 204 lots traded early . 
November heating oil traded 73.25 cents , down 0.20 cent from the close as roughly 255 lots changed hands . 
December NYMEX crude eased two cents to trade $ 25.51 a barrel , as 460 lots changed hands .
