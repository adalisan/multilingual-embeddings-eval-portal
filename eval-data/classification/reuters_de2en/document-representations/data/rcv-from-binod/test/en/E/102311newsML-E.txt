the Venezuelan government plans to pay off at least 209 billion bolivars ( $ 450 million ) worth of foreign and domestic debt principal and interests from windfall oil revenues , a top government official said Tuesday . 
&quot; The government has available 209 billion bolivars from excess oil revenues , &quot; Armando Leon , vice planning minister , told reporters in Congress . 
government officials have said they expect to receive over $ 2.5 billion in windfall oil revenues this year due to higher than expected oil prices . 
most of that extra revenue has already been set aside through separate additional spending requests approved by Congress . 
Leon and other government officials present in Congress said there were no legal impediment to prevent Venezuela using the windfall oil money to buy back Brady bond debt . 
but they declined to say whether Venezuela would do so .
