SIMEX Nikkei futures ended fractionally easier on Wednesday as market euphoria over the Japanese government &apos;s plans to boost the stagnant land market faded , dealers said . 
they said there was speculation that the Finance Ministry &apos;s announcement on Tuesday saying it would detail land liquidity measures on March 31 could just be an attempt to lift the Nikkei before the financial year end . 
&quot; The market welcomed the land scheme yesterday but there &apos;s some doubt about whether they can come up with a concrete plan in less than two weeks , &quot; said a trader with a Japanese house . 
the benchmark Nikkei 225 June contract lost 35 points to close at 18,430 after hitting an early high of 18,520 . 
turnover was a light 10,760 lots . 
dealers said the dollar &apos;s weakness against the yen , the Dow &apos;s overnight drop and a reluctance to take new positions ahead of a Japanese holiday on Thursday also dampened sentiment . 
&quot; But it was profit-taking rather than any aggressive selling , &quot; said the trader , adding that the June Nikkei was likely to be supported at 18,200 . 
he said the contract would face immediate resistance at 18,500 and at the more critical level of 18,700 . 
the March MSCI Taiwan index contract ended at 358.3 against its opening 363.0 on volume of 756 lots .
