North Korea &apos;s top ideologue , sheltering in a South Korean diplomatic mission in Beijing , may leave China as early as Monday for the Philippines , state radio reported . 
Korea Broadcasting System said Hwang Jang-yop was still in the Beijing consulate but South Korean ambassador Chung Chong-wook had bade him farewell . 
a Seoul foreign ministry spokesman declined to comment on the report . 
&quot; We have decided not to talk about Hwang &apos;s whereabouts or the timing of his departure , &quot; he said . 
another ministry official said China and South Korea had agreed that Hwang , the most senior official to flee the impoverished North , would be sent to a third country before being allowed asylum in South Korea . 
he said the Philippines was one of several &quot; transit points &quot; being considered . 
the Dong-A Ilbo , South Korea &apos;s leading daily , said Hwang would leave China by a military plane through a military base on the outskirts of Beijing . 
the state radio report said Hwang was expected to spend a month in Subic Bay , a former U.S. naval base north of Manila and now a free port with an international airport , before being brought to South Korea . 
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said on Saturday his country had been asked to serve as a transit point for Hwang if he were allowed to leave for South Korea . 
Hwang has been marooned in the consular compound since arriving on February 12 while Chinese and South Korean officials negotiate his fate . 
Siazon indicated Manila was prepared to accept the request in order to help resolve the impasse , but stressed there had been no definite word the Philippines would be a stop-off point for any transfer of Hwang to South Korea . 
a top Manila Foreign Office official , when asked if it was likely Hwang would stay in the Philippines for a few days , said : &quot; Most probably . 
&quot; It cannot be that he will not get out of the plane because that would be like going direct from Beijing to Seoul . 
that would defeat the third country arrangement , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; It is also possible that we are being used as a decoy , &quot; he added . 
Siazon told reporters on Saturday before he left on an official visit to Japan that some other routes besides the Philippines were probably being considered .
