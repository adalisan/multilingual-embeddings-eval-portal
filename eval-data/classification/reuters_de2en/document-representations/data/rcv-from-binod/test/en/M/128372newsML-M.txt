the South African futures Exchange ( Safex ) , which runs a futures market in maize , may launch a spot maize market following requests from a number of the country &apos;s major grain buyers . 
although South Africa already has an electronic cash maize market , Agmex , industry players said on Thursday it had not attracted much business . 
Agmex , which was launched in May , trades maize via auctions which are co-ordinated by Pretoria-based co-operative Uniegraan . 
Hamish McBain , an executive director of Tiger oats Ltd , one of the country &apos;s biggest maize buyers , said the volumes traded on Agmex were very small relative to this season &apos;s local maize trade of seven to eight million tonnes . 
&quot; Of that only 220,000 tonnes was offered by Agmex . 
and of that only 19,000 was sold on their auctions , &quot; McBain said . 
he said he believed Safex had the necessary expertise and procedures in place to run a cash grains market . 
&quot; It ( Safex ) is best geared up to offer the right kind of spot market . 
they are more experienced , have rules and standard contracts in place and an information network , &quot; McBain said . 
he said a meeting of interested parties , at which both Safex and Agmex would be present , would be held in November to discuss the direction and form of the spot market . 
Rod Blondin , newly-appointed general manager of Safex &apos;s agricultural markets division , told Reuters Safex had been approached by market players over setting up a cash market . 
&quot; We do believe we have something to offer ( a cash market ) ... , &quot; Blondin said , adding that Safex &apos;s primary focus would remain the futures market . 
&quot; ( But ) an effective spot market is also important for the enhancement of the futures market ... , &quot; he said . 
Agmex was not immediately available for comment .
