the pound &apos;s rally over the past year has boosted sterling Eurobonds , with new issue volumes doubling compared with last year . 
&quot; Last year , there was very little international demand but sterling has now been appreciating against European currencies , &quot; said a syndicate manager at HSBC Markets . 
the popularity was expected to continue until at least the year-end , although the general election in 1997 could put a damper on things , traders said . 
about $ 33 billion equivalent was raised in the first three quarters of 1996 versus $ 16 billion in the same period last year , Capital data Bondware figures showed . 
sterling &apos;s total market share rose by nearly half to 6.6 percent . 
sterling , now nudging its best level in 21 months around 2.40 marks , has recovered steadily from its all-time low around 2.17 marks last November . 
yields in sterling are also higher than those in other European markets , with investors earning an extra two percent on a five-year bond compared with German paper . 
big international borrowers like Sweden , the European Investment Bank , Commerzbank and Credit Local have all taken advantage of this trend and raised sterling funds . 
increased funding needs from British building societies and the British government &apos;s private finance initiative have also increased the supply of sterling bonds aimed at British institutional investors . 
four building societies are planning to become banks in 1997 -- Alliance &amp; Leicester , Halifax , Northern Rock and Woolwich -- and need to raise substantial funds to rejig balance sheets . 
up to 2.5 billion stg could be raised by the four from the subordinated debt market alone , said Rob Thomas , a UBS analyst . 
this is around the same amount as is currently outstanding in the sector . 
the government &apos;s so-called private finance initiative , which aims to shift the capital cost and risk of public investments into public hands , has brought supply to the bond market and further issuance was expected . 
next week , for example , a multi-tranche bond for a total of 860 million stg will be issued by Annington homes , the consortium that bought British Ministry of Defence homes . 
the transaction will securitise the rental income received from the properties . 
the question will be how investors react to a British election , which has to be held by May 1997 at the latest , and a possible change in government as predicted by all opinion polls . 
&quot; The markets are taking quite a neutral view of the election so far , but an election year may interrupt the issuance flow somewhat , &quot; said a syndicate manager at SBC Warburg . 
a dealer at HSBC Markets said &quot; It is likely that things will slow down a bit internationally ahead of the election , but domestic borrowing is likely to stay active . 
&quot; British names may even step up issuance to get it done before the general election , &quot; he said .
