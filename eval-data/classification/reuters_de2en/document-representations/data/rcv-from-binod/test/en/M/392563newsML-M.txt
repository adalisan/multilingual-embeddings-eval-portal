Gulf middle distillate premiums are likely to stay in current ranges unless India Oil Corp &apos;s ( IOC ) diesel ( gas oil ) import tender on Friday prompts a race for spot April cargoes , Gulf traders said on Thursday . 
one percent sulphur gas oil has settled at a 40-50 cents premium to independent Gulf price quotes . 
it would struggle to move higher unless IOC surprised market expectations that the Indian state firm will purchase around 700,000 tonnes of diesel . 
a lesser amount of diesel would put pressure on premiums which are already capped by remaining unsold cargoes for March . 
rival supplies from the Mediterranean are also competing for limted Asian demand , traders said . 
&quot; It hinges on IOC needs to remove some of the Saudi and Kuwaiti surplus , &quot; said one trader . 
gas oil was assessed at $ 23.60 a barrel fob Gulf on Thursday , up just 10 cents from February 13 . 
Gulf jet-kerosene continued to hold up well despite peak winter demand being over with March premiums finding support from jet stock-building by Saudi Arabia ahead of the annual Haj pilgrimage which starts in April , traders said . 
jet , assessed at $ 26.70 fob Gulf , could command up to a 65 cents premium to quotes for March supplies and superior kerosene at 50 cents . 
traders saw little market fall out from news that Caltex , the Texaco and Chevron joint venture , would sell its 40 percent stake in the 250,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) Sitra refinery from April . 
&quot; All the term contracts have already gone to the Bahrainis ... There won &apos;t been any stranded cargoes , &quot; another trader based in the region said .
