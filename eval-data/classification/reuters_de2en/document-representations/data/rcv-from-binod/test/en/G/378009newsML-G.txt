the Slovak parliament approved a resolution on Friday to hold a referendum on whether Slovakia should join NATO . 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar &apos;s nationalist-populist coalition government wants to be one of the first of the former Soviet bloc countries to join NATO . 
but diplomats say it is unlikely to achieve this , and analysts say a &quot; no &quot; in the referendum may save the government from some embarrassment if the country is not asked to join . 
according to Slovak law , President Michal Kovac must set a date for the referendum within 30 days on the three questions , which were approved by parliament . 
they were : 
-- Are you in favour of the deployment of nuclear weapons on Slovak soil ? 
-- Are you in favour of the establishment of foreign military bases on Slovak territory ? 
the resolution was approved by 87 votes in favour , 37 votes against and 15 abstentions among the 140 deputies present in the 150-seat parliament . 
one deputy present did not vote . 
Tibor Cabaj , a deputy of the senior ruling coalition party , the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia ( HZDS ) , said he submitted the plan for the referendum to get a non-binding signal on NATO from the populace . 
&quot; This referendum will have , lets &apos;s say , an advisory effect for the government . 
of course it does not change the government &apos;s programme , in which NATO membership has a top priority , &quot; Cabaj told the house . 
the parliamentary opposition has strongly criticised the move , saying the questions in the referendum are phrased deliberately to make people vote against integration in NATO . 
&quot; A referendum with questions like this indicates there is a certain group inside the ruling coalition that purposely acts against the proclaimed priority of the Slovak foreign policy , which is integration to western structures , &quot; Jan Simko of the opposition Christian Democratic Movement told the house . 
according to a public opinion poll in December , only 35.1 percent said they supported membership and 25.5 percent were against , compared to a poll in June in which 44 percent supported NATO membership with 30 percent against . 
Slovaks are sensitive to having a new connection with foreign military powers after being a Soviet satellite as part of Czechoslovakia for more than 40 years . 
NATO member states are to hold a summit in Madrid in July to nominate the first candidates for membership from post-communist countries , and diplomats have said that Poland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic are most likely to be named . 
independent political analysts said the referendum gives Meciar &apos;s government an excuse when the NATO invitation does not arrive . 
&quot; ( The government ) knows they &apos;re not going to get accepted into NATO , and it &apos;s their responsibility , so they want to word the referendum so people will vote &apos; no , &apos; &quot; said Sharon Fisher , Slovak analyst at the Open Media Research Institute in Prague . 
&quot; Then they can say &apos; Well , the people didn &apos;t want it anyway , &apos; &quot; she added . 
soon after the split of the former Czechoslovakia in 1993 , Slovakia was considered to be among the top contenders for early entry into NATO . 
but its chances waned after the United States and the EU repeatedly criticised Bratislava for lagging behind in the development of democratic principles .
