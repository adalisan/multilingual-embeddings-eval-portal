heavy rainfall in Italy on Sunday and Monday has relieved some of the drought conditions affecting many regions of the country for the past three months , the Agriculture Ministry &apos;s Central Office for Agrarian Ecology said in a statement made available to Reuters . 
the Rome-based office said the regions most affected by lack of rain were Piedmont , Lombardy , Trentino Alto Adige , Friuli Venezia Giulia , Veneto and Liguria in the north , as well as Puglia and Calabria in the south . 
but heavy rainfall , particularly last Sunday , has alleviated some of the abnormally dry conditions and data shows the start of a return to a normal state of soil moisture for the season in a large part of northern and central Italy , the office said . 
however , the office noted , &quot; very heavy downpours are not always totally useful to agriculture because , apart from damaging some above-soil crops , part of the excess rainfall which cannot be absorbed by the soil flows away on the surface of the ground and is wasted . 
the office gave the following data on rainfall by region for Sunday April 27 and Monday April 28 from meteorological stations reporting rainfall of over 10 millimetres : 
Piedmont 12.2 mm 
Lombardy Max 44.0 ( Milan Malpensa airport ) 
Trentino 31.0
