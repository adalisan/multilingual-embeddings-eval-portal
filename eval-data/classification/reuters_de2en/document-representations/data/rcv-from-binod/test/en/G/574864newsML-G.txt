unemployment is the most important issue in France &apos;s parliamentary election campaign and more voters believe the current centre-right government can handle the problem than the leftist opposition , a poll said on Sunday . 
the CSA poll for France 3 television found that 98 percent of voters considered a candidate &apos;s approach to France &apos;s 12.8 percent unemployment to be crucial to how they would vote . 
it found that 33 percent of voters thought the centre-right would do a better job of bringing down unemployment while 28 percent preferred the leftist opposition . 
in a bit of bad news for the current majority , however , just 35 percent of voters said they thought that Prime Minister and Gaullist party head Alain Juppe , who is leading the government campaign , was doing a good job of running the campaign . 
half of those polled thought Juppe was doing a bad job while the rest had no opinion . 
thirty-nine percent said they would cast their ballot to demonstrate their opposition to Gaullist President Jacques Chirac while 34 percent said they would vote to show their support for the head of state . 
the others had no opinion or said their vote was not intended to reflect on Chirac . 
on the left , 41 percent were pleased with Socialist Lionel Jospin &apos;s campaign leadership and 46 percent displeased . 
the poll found that just two out of five voters were following campaign developments on a daily basis . 
one in 10 was not following them at all . 
France &apos;s two-round snap parliamentary election has been set for May 25-June 1 . 
the CSA poll relied on interviews with 1,000 registered voters conducted on Friday and Saturday .
