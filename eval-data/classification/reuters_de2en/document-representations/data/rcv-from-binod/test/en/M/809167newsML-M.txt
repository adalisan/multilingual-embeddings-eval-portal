investors must see falling Indian share prices as an opportunity to pick up stocks , Caspian Research India Pvt Ltd said . 
&quot; The volatility of the next four to five months should be viewed as opportunity to accumulate stock , &quot; the securities firm said in its latest report . 
the fall in share prices is a logical correction after the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange index had soared 60 percent from a three-year low reached in December 1996 , it said . 
&quot; Until the end of calendar 1997 , we expect sporadic slumps ... driven by concerns over political uncertainty , the risk of a later-than-anticipated economic upturn and expected poor corporate results for the six months to September 30 , &quot; it said . 
in early afternoon trade on Tuesday the BSE index was down 140.20 points , or 3.2 percent , at 4,181.77 . 
it had hit a 34-month high of 4,605.41 more than two weeks ago . 
these downswings will be offset by sharp rallies on better liquidity in the economy driving domestic institutional demand , the report prepared by research head Tony Tassell and strategist Chetan Ahya said . 
&quot; The net result will be a choppy uptrend until the end of calendar 1997 , &quot; they said , adding a clearer uptrend will emerge at the start of 1998 . 
expectations of strong corporate earnings growth in fiscal 1998 / 99 ( April-March ) and statistical evidence of long-delayed pick-up in current sluggish economic evidence will boost the market . 
&quot; Overall , we expect the BSE 30 Index to rise to about 4,800 by the fiscal year-end on March 31 ( 1998 ) , &quot; the report said . 
it said the gains would be more if foreign portfolio inflows rise , especially with new allocations for 1998 .
