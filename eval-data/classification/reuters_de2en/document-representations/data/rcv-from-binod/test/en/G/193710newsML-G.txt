German prosecutors demanded life sentences on Friday for the two main defendants on trial for the murder of four Kurdish dissidents which justice authorities said was ordered by Iran . 
Federal prosecutor Bruno Jost said Iranian Kazem Darabi , 37 , and Abbas Rhayel , 29 , from Lebanon should be found guilty on four counts of murder and one of attempted murder . 
he described the assassinations as &quot; cold and cynical &quot; . 
he also demanded 11 years for Lebanese Youssef Amin accused of standing on watch while the dissidents were gunned down in the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin in 1992 . 
&quot; There is not the slightest doubt that the attack was decided , planned and prepared by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its leaders , &quot; Jost told the court . 
&quot; The brazen attempts by the Tehran government to influence the proceedings point to this having happened on Iran &apos;s orders , &quot; he said . 
Jost said the trial had succeeded in &quot; opening the door a bit to the headquarters of Iranian state terrorism and casting a look at the killing machine . 
Iran protested to Germany on Thursday against earlier prosecution charges about its role , saying its judiciary had &quot; under the influence of the Zionists ... embarked on an evil political game against the Islamic Republic of Iran . 
Iran has denied all involvement in the killings . 
in his summing up at the end of a three-year trial , Jost repeatedly accused Tehran of ordering the murders . 
in response , Iran called in Germany &apos;s ambassador in Tehran and one Iranian newspaper called for Iran to break all ties with Bonn . 
the prosecution told the court earlier this week that an Iranian special state committee , which allegedly included supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , had ordered the assassinations . 
a Berlin state court has spent almost three years hearing evidence against the five men charged with shooting dead three exiled Iranian Kurdish leaders and their translator . 
the murder of the General Secretary of the Kurdish Democratic Party in Iran ( PDKI ) Sadegh Charafkandi , and three of his escorts , was a reprehensible act , Jost said . 
the victims were defenceless against an accurate hail of fire . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t get any more treacherous than this , &quot; Jost said . 
he said Darabi was the ringmaster and Rhayel pulled the trigger . 
he demanded five-year sentences for two other Lebanese defendants , Mohammed Atris and Atallah Ayad . 
the Iranian newspaper Kayhan called on Tehran to break ties with Bonn , its biggest trade partner , and suggested that Moslems would take unspecified actions against Germany . 
&quot; After this affront to the sanctity of the Moslem nation of Iran , it is the duty of the honourable government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to expell Germany &apos;s ambassador without hesitation and to cut all trade , economic and political ties with this government , &quot; the hardline daily said .
