following is the full text of the June Report on Business ( Purchasing Managers &apos; Survey ) of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply . 
the survey is sponsored by Reuters . 
strong growth in manufacturing sector continues . 
supply chain reveals little sign of inflationary pressures . 
the seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers &apos; Index ( PMI -- a composite indicator designed to provide an overall view of manufacturing activity ) signalled expansion for the thirteenth consecutive month in June . 
the main source of new business was the domestic market with the strength of the pound again reported to have significantly subdued foreign demand . 
nevertheless , export orders did rise modestly due to the continued strengthening of economic growth in overseas markets . 
total order levels showed significant growth on the whole as a result -- the thirteenth consecutive monthly increase . 
purchasing managers reported further growth in output to meet the rise in order books . 
however , although over a quarter of all firms raised production during the month , the rate of growth slowed compared to that recorded in May . 
the deceleration was in part attributable to an increased incidence of firms deliberately reducing stocks of finished goods in order to cut costs . 
despite further evidence of sustained high demand levels in the manufacturing economy reported by purchasing managers , companies have yet to experience significant capacity constraints -- or the potential inflationary impact on prices that tends to accompany supply shortages . 
suppliers were reported to have had little difficulty in meeting existing levels of demand and one in five firms recorded a fall in prices compared with May . 
the strength of the pound was again the principal factor behind falling input prices through its continued deflationary effect on the price of imports . 
the favourable outlook for prices and good availability of supplies encouraged purchasing managers to reduce their stocks of purchases once more in June for cost considerations . 
the need to reduce costs was also reflected in employment . 
although output has now risen for thirteen consecutive months manufacturing firms remained reluctant to take on new staff in June . 
employment showed only modest growth as a result . 
* The Purchasing Managers &apos; Index ( PMI ) is a composite indicator designed to provide an overall view of activity in the manufacturing economy and acts as a leading indicator for the whole economy . 
the indicator is derived from individual diffusion indices which measure changes in output , new orders , employment , suppliers &apos; delivery times and stocks of goods purchased . 
the seasonally adjusted index may be subject to revision as improved estimation of seasonal adjustments occur with each month &apos;s new data . 
purchasing managers reported the thirteenth successive monthly rise in manufacturing output in June . 
a quarter of all companies reported output to have risen on the previous month to meet growth in orders , but the rate of growth nevertheless fell to the lowest level recorded so far this year . 
investment goods industries reported the sharpest rise but strong growth was also recorded by firms in the consumer and intermediate sectors . 
order books strengthened for the thirteenth successive month in June . 
almost one third of all manufacturers reported a rise in new orders compared with levels in May . 
buoyant demand from UK consumers provided the principal source of new business while export orders grew only modestly as the strength of the pound continued to subdue overseas demand . 
the quantity of goods purchased rose in June but the rate of growth slowed for the third month running . 
the latest increase was the smallest recorded this year . 
the deceleration in the rate of growth of purchasing activity largely reflected manufacturers &apos; continued desire to keep stock levels as low as possible for cost considerations . 
manufacturers reported a further significant fall in input prices in June . 
average prices have now fallen for twenty consecutive months . 
the effect of the strong pound in reducing import prices was again widely reported by manufacturers as having a deflationary influence on raw material prices . 
the successful negotiation of lower prices with suppliers was another predominant factor behind the fall . 
the seasonally adjusted Suppliers &apos; Delivery Times Index signalled only a modest lengthening of lead-times in June . 
despite the continued strength of demand in the manufacturing economy , only 10 % of purchasing managers reported delays at their suppliers . 
this suggests that , on the whole , the pace of growth has yet to generate significant capacity constraints . 
stocks of purchases fell again in June , with the seasonally adjusted index recording an identical level to May . 
many manufacturers were encouraged to continue cost-cutting stock reduction programmes due to the sustained good availability of supplies and a favourable outlook for prices . 
stocks of finished goods held by manufacturers fell again in June . 
stocks have now fallen for twenty months in succession . 
the depletion was once more attributed by the majority of firms to sales growth exceeding growth in production . 
however , compared with recent months , the June survey found an increase in the number of companies deliberately destocking to cut costs . 
manufacturing employment rose in June to meet increased production requirements , but remained subdued relative to the rate of growth of output and new orders . 
the reluctance of firms to significantly increase recruitment levels was again generally attributed to their need to reduce costs . 
the rate of growth of employment was highest in investment goods industries . 
the output Index for the consumer goods industries signalled expansion again in June . 
the rate of output growth fell significantly however , as manufacturers responded to a slowdown in the growth of new orders . 
this in turn led to a fall in firms &apos; purchases of raw materials . 
allowing for seasonal factors , quantity of purchases fell sharply in June for the first time since November 1995 , and as a result suppliers &apos; delivery times were reported to have shortened significantly . 
the relaxation in demand for raw materials , allied to the strength of the pound , was also illustrated in a marked fall in input prices . 
manufacturers reported no notable change in their stocks of finished goods compared with May . 
employment rose for the third consecutive month . 
the investment goods industries recorded the strongest growth of both output and new orders of all three sectors in June . 
buoyant domestic demand and an acceleration in the rate of growth of export orders drove the total orders index to its highest level since August 1995 . 
following a slight fall in May , the amount of goods purchased also showed rapid growth in June as companies expanded production to satisfy the rise of new business . 
in spite of manufacturers &apos; strengthened demand for raw materials , input prices fell for the thirteenth month in succession . 
this was due to firms &apos; continued ability to negotiate lower prices with suppliers , and the effect of the strong pound in reducing import prices . 
employment grew again in the investment goods industries in June . 
the seasonally adjusted New Orders Index for intermediate goods industries recorded its highest level since November 1996 in June , driven by an improvement in both domestic and export demand . 
output also rose but at a slower rate than recorded in May as manufacturers concentrated on reducing stock levels . 
the Stocks of finished Goods Index remained significantly below 50.0 as the growth in orders was often met from stocks rather than production . 
a further fall in input prices reflected the muted growth in firms &apos; quantities of goods purchased and the continued deflationary effect of the strong pound on the price of imports . 
employment rose marginally , but at a slower rate than in the previous month .
