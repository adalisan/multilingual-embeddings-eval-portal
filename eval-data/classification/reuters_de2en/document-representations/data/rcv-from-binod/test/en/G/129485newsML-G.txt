Welsh rugby union officials reached a truce with their first division clubs on Monday , ending a year-long power struggle over television rights and money . 
the agreement sets a precedent for the Rugby Football Union which resumes talks with England &apos;s professional clubs on Tuesday in an attempt to thrash out a similar peace formula . 
the Welsh have agreed to form an eight-member joint management committee to run the professional game . 
the clubs and the Welsh Rugby Union ( WRU ) will be represented by four members each . 
in addition , the WRU agreed to fund the clubs for the current season . 
&quot; I firmly believe that today &apos;s meeting and the concensus it has achieved is the biggest thing that has happened to Welsh rugby since the 1999 Rugby World Cup was awarded to Wales , &quot; said WRU chairman Vernon Pugh .
