trading in options on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange &apos;s ( PHLX ) gold / silver index as well as a couple of gold mining companies picked up Wednesday as the broader stock market fell sharply for a second day . 
the gold / silver index rallied 3.80 points , or 3.3 percent , to 118.99 as most other stock indices fell sharply . 
the bellwether Dow industrial average fell 20 points to about 6,423 , staging a strong comeback from an afternoon deficit of 75 points . 
&quot; Maybe there &apos;s a little flight to safety in gold and gold stocks , &quot; said Michael Schwartz at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . 
among XAU options , the December 120 and 125 calls saw the most activity , with 1,295 contracts and 1,097 contracts changing hands , respectively . 
the 115 , 120 and 125 calls in the January , February and March series also saw some activity . 
elsewhere , the Newmont Mining Corp December 50 call was the most active call on the PHLX , with 2,885 contracts changing hands . 
the stock added 1-1 / 8 to 47-1 / 2 on 1.05 million shares . 
other active Newmont options included the December 47-1 / 2 call , the January 55 call and the December 45 put . 
some of the busiest options overall were the Barrick Gold Corp January 25 put and April 25 put , each of which traded more than 10,000 contracts . 
Barrick shares traded in the U.S. gained 1-1 / 8 to 29-1 / 4 on volume of 2.2 million shares . 
the Barrick January 25 put traded 10,030 contracts and the April 25 put traded 10,250 . 
ten thousand contracts of each option were crossed as spreads . 
two blocks of 5,000 contracts each traded on both the options . 
Harrison Roth , a first vice president at Cowen &amp; Co , said an investor may have bought back the January 25s and sold the April 25s to effectively roll a position out three months .
