the United States has sued Iran for damages to U.S. warships and U.S.-flagged vessels in the latest round of legal battles stemming from the Iran-Iraq war , the State Department &apos;s top lawyer said on Tuesday . 
the U.S. claim , which did not specify the amount of damages sought , was filed with the International Court of Justice in the Hague on Monday in response to related Iranian claims against Washington , said Michael Matheson , the acting legal adviser . 
&quot; We &apos;re claiming for damages done by Iranian forces in attacking U.S.-owned and U.S.-flagged vessels in the Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war , &quot; Matheson said in an interview with Reuters . 
the court , the U.N. judicial arm , dealt the United States an initial setback in the case last December , when it agreed to hear , over U.S. objections , Iran &apos;s claim for damages for the destruction of three of its oil platforms by U.S. warships 10 years ago . 
the dispute stems from the final stages of the 1980-88 war between Iran and Iraq when then President Ronald Reagan reregistered 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers under the American flag to give them U.S. Navy protection from Iranian attack . 
at the time , Iran viewed Kuwait as a belligerent becuase it aided Iraq financially and let arms bound for Iraq enter through Kuwaiti ports . 
Matheson said the U.S. decision to file a counterclaim had &quot; nothing to do with any political events in Iran &quot; after the election last month of a relatively moderate cleric , Mohammad Khatami , as president . 
the U.S. action added to the thicket at the U.N. Court and the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal , which is handling billions of dollars in disputes dating to the 1981 Algiers Accord that freed 52 hostages held for 444 days at the U.S. embasssy . 
&quot; It raises the serious possibility that the United States and Iran will be caught in an unending cycle of legal actions against each other , &quot; said Patrick Clawson , a scholar on Iran at the Pentagon &apos;s National Defence University . 
he said if Washington were eager to open a new chapter , &quot; it would be much more fruitful to approach the Iranians for some global settlement &quot; of outstanding claims against each other . 
this would let both governments put their own face-saving spin on any future deal , Clawson added . 
Matheson tied the counterclaim strictly to conduct of the oil platform lawsuit , which Iran brought in November 1992 and which officials said could drag on for years . 
the U.S. decision to go ahead with the counterclaim was approved at higher State Department levels , outside the office of the legal adviser , department officials said . 
Iran has charged that U.S. attacks on its oil platforms in October 1987 and April 1988 violated interntional law . 
it has argued that a 1955 Treaty of amity between the two countries provided a legal basis for the court to settle the dispute . 
on Oct . 19 , 1987 , U.S. warships bombarded an offshore Iranian oil rig allegedly being used as a base for Iranian gunboats . 
it acted after an Iranian silkworm missile hit a reflagged oil tanker in Kuwaiti waters , injuring 18 crewmen . 
the U.S. Navy destroyed two more Iranian plaforms after the U.S. frigate Samuel B. Roberts struck an underwater mine , allegedly laid by Iran , in international waters in the central gulf on April 14 , 1988 . 
the U.S. countersuit claims that Iran disrupted freedom of navigation by these attacks , Matheson said . 
the lengthy U.S. filing with the court was supported by a boxload of exhibits , including maps , charts and photographs . 
if the U.N. court rules on the U.S. counterclaim , its findings could help define new naval warfare rules such as those governing the resort to the use of force in international disputes , U.S. officials said .
