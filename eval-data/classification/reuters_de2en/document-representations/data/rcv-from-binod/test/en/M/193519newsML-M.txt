U.S. spot millfeed prices were mostly steady to firmer on Friday bolstered by an increase in demand in several regions , dealers said . 
&quot; Cold weather has created a little more interest , &quot; a Minneapolis dealer said . 
&quot; buyers are seeing the light here . 
better buy ( midds ) if you want it because winter is setting in . 
Minneapolis spot prices rose $ 4 to bid at $ 79.00 a ton and offer at $ 82.00 . 
in the Carolinas , activity remained subdued . 
but one dealer noted that spot prices had a negative tone because buyers were taking corn at cheaper prices . 
he also said more alternative feeds were available . 
Carolinas spot prices were unchanged and offered at $ 97.00 a ton . 
a buffalo dealer said he believes mills will be taking some downtime during the thanksgiving holiday . 
&quot; So , they ( buyers ) will take what they have to for next week and hold out for a little premium for the following week , &quot; he said .
