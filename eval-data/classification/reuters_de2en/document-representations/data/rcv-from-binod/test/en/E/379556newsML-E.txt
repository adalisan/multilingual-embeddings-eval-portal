inventories held by businesses declined slightly in December as fewer goods remained on the shelves of manufacturers , wholesalers and retailers , the Commerce Department said on Friday . 
total business inventories fell a slight 0.1 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted $ 1.01 trillion after being revised to show no change in November . 
previously , the department said inventories had risen 0.1 percent in November . 
the slight tailing off in stocks of goods , which was anticipated by Wall Street economists , indicated that businesses were keeping close control over their stocks of goods as 1996 ended . 
lean inventories leave room for production to continue at steady levels or to increase quickly if demand justifies it . 
investment for inventory-building bolsters economic activity . 
the trimming of inventories on December occurred despite the fact that business sales fell slightly by 0.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 727.76 billion , after rising a revised 0.4 percent in November . 
the department previously said November sales had grown by 0.6 percent . 
the December inventories decline was particularly apparent at the wholesale level , where stocks of unsold goods dropped 0.6 percent to $ 256.34 billion after rising 0.1 percent in November . 
manufacturers &apos; inventories were down 0.3 percent to $ 438.17 billion following a 0.3 percent gain in November . 
the only category of business that had higher inventories in December than in November was retailing , where unsold goods grew by 0.4 percent to $ 314.96 billion after a 0.6 percent drop in November . 
the inventory-to-sales ratio -- a measure of how long it would take to sell existing stocks at the current pace -- remained at 1.39 months &apos; worth in December , the same level it has been at since September .
