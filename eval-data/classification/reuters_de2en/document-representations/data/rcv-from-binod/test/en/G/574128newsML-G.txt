Lithuania &apos;s Homeland Union Party named independence hero Vytautas Landsbergis as its presidential candidate on Saturday . 
the election is expected in December and Landsbergis , 64 , is likely to face his arch-rival President Algirdas Brazauskas , the former head of the Baltic state &apos;s Communist Party . 
he was nominated by a unanimous conference vote of his party , which he led back to power in parliamentary polls last year , unseating the former communists who had regained office a year after independence . 
capturing the presidency would complete a political comeback for Landsbergis , a former music professor who is currently chairman of parliament . 
he confirmed his plans before the party meeting , telling Reuters : &quot; I will stand as a candidate in the next presidential election . 
but defeating the 64-year-old Brazauskas will be no easy task . 
despite his communist past , Brazauskas , president since 1993 , has a solid pro-reform reputation and is a staunch supporter of Lithuania &apos;s efforts to join both NATO and the European Union . 
he consistently tops opinion polls as the best man for the job . 
the president has not announced that he will run again but analysts say he relishes the job , is in good health , and is always ready for a political fight . 
Landsbergis &apos;s confrontational style alarms some in the West , who feel that he may be less than diplomatic with Moscow at a time when NATO is trying to ease Russian concerns about its plans to expand to the east . 
but his supporters hope his leadership in the sometimes bloody drive to break free of Moscow &apos;s rule has not been forgotten . 
&quot; He may be inconvenient for some foreign politicians , &quot; Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius told Reuters , &quot; But he is necessary for Lithuania , which wants to return to Europe .
