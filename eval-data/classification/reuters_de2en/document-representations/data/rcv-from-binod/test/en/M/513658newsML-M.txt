active liquidation sparked by wire reports that a Indiana rose farmer died from Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease ( CJD ) , a human version of mad cow disease , pushed CME live cattle futures into sell stops and April and June cattle ended down the 1.500 cent daily limit . 
April live cattle ended limit down at 68.800 cents per lb and June sank the limit to 63.900 cents . 
other months ended 1.175 to 0.450 cent lower . 
the scientific name of mad cow disease is bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) . 
feeder cattle ended 0.375 to 1.425 lower with May off most at 70.225 cents after falling the limit earlier . 
&quot; The story pushed the ( futures ) market through stops , &quot; said Dave Maher from Securities Corporation of Iowa . 
in one wire report , the wife of the CJD victim speculated that her husband &apos;s death may have been linked to his use of fertilizer containing bone meal . 
but livestock analysts were quick to point out that BSE has not been detected in U.S. cattle and futures may rebound Thursday when more details may be available about the death . 
Indiana health officials said several cases of CJD have occured since 1990 in that state . 
&quot; I hope the story is found to be just a rumor , we sure could do without that kind of news . 
look for a higher close Thursday , &quot; Maher said . 
&quot; Until there is some evidence that bovine spongiform encephalopathy , otherwise known as mad cow disease , is present in the U.S. cattle population I think there there is no reason for futures react to those kinds of stories , &quot; said Chuck Levitt , analyst with Alaron Trading Corp. 
live cattle futures had already depressed by expectations the next move in cash cattle markets would be lower , especially with fed cattle numbers set to increase . 
adding to this scenario were analysts &apos; estimates for Friday &apos;s USDA Cattle-on-Feed report that indicated larger fed cattle supplies than a year ago , traders said . 
estimates for the number of cattle on feed April 1 in large feedlots in the seven key states averaged 107.6 percent of a year ago in a Reuter pre-report survey , and ranged 106 to 108 percent . 
March placements averaged 103.3 percent and ranged from 100.5 to 107 percent and March marketings averaged 100.6 percent and ranged from 98 to 104.5 percent . 
in live cattle options , June closed synthetically at 63.600 , down another 0.30 cent . 
Commission houses bought June 60 puts on the early break and then bought June 64 and 65 straddles late . 
volatility was down four to five percent in June and August , pit sources said . 
feeder cattle futures followed the lead of live cattle and tumbled for a limit loss in May before scattered support surfaced . 
underlying strength in feeders was linked to lower corn futures , strong cash feeder prices and recent heavy death losses in the northern Plains , traders said . 
the latest CME feeder cattle index was up $ 0.17 at $ 70.65 per cwt .
