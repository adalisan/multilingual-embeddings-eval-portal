the Queensland reds lost their third consecutive Super 12 match of the season in another disappointing display at Free State Stadium on Saturday . 
the Super 10 champions of 1994 and 1995 went down 35-24 to Free State and were made to pay for getting on the wrong side of referee Carl Spannenberg . 
leading 7-5 after 17 minutes the reds were kicked into submission by three penalties in 11 minutes from Free State fly-half Jannie de Beer . 
all three came from technical infringements which Spannenberg seemed to be alone in detecting . 
free State scrum-half Werner Swanepoel opened the scoring in the third minute , running 20 metres down an untended blindside to score . 
the reds responded with a try from prop Dan Crowley who was pushed over from a lineout take by John Eales . 
Eales conveted , but his side were frozen out of the rest of the first half . 
after fly-half Shane Drahm had dropped a goal on the half hour , Free State scored from the restart kick . 
Flanker Charl van Rensburg charged down scrum-half Elton Moncrief &apos;s kick to score in the corner . 
the Cheetahs put together their best movement of the match in injury time , sending the ball down both wings before Jan-Harm van Wyk finished the movement on the left . 
with Free State 26-10 up at the interval , de Beer stretched the lead with his fourth penalty in the third minute of the second half , but Queensland responded with two tries to put the match back into the balance . 
Drahm rounded off a fluent movement down the right in the 48th minute and Wallaby centre Jason Little was credited with a pushover try from another Eales lineout take . 
at 29-24 after 63 minutes it was anyone &apos;s game , but de Beer sealed it for the home side with a penalty in the 67th minute and a cleverly taken drop goal in the 75th .
