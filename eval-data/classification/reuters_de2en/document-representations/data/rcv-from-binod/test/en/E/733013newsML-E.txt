Pakistan on Wednesday unveiled plans to narrow its trade gap to $ 2.33 billion in fiscal 1997 / 98 ( July-June ) from $ 3.37 billion in 1996 / 97 . 
commerce Minister Ishaq Dar , announcing the policy for 1997 / 98 after approval by the cabinet , said exports were to grow 15 percent to $ 9.575 billion from the year-earlier &apos;s $ 8.26 billion and imports to $ 11.9 billion from $ 11.63 billion . 
&quot; export-led growth is the cornerstone of this government &apos;s economic strategy , &quot; he said in a televised speech . 
&quot; larger and high value-added exports will not only help improve the balance of payments but will also provide employment opportunities , &quot; he said . 
&quot; To lay the foundations of a robust outward-oriented economy , it is now imperative to reverse the anti-export bias in the economic structure evolved over the last 50 years . 
he said there would be adequate export finance for small- and medium-sized exporters through commercial banks at lower rates . 
Dar said 50 percent of the duty drawback to exporters would now be paid within three days of the presentation of documents and the balance after verification of customs authorities . 
&quot; Machinery ( not manufactured locally ) imported by engineering units for export-related production ( will ) be subject to a zero rate of tariff up to 200 percent of the export value during the preceding financial year ... 
&quot; This facility would be available on an annual basis up to 30th June , 2000 , &quot; he added . 
local assemblers and manufacturers of vehicles had been allowed duty-free imports of assembly kits , corresponding to the number of their exported units , Dar said . 
&quot; There would be no sales tax on imported raw materials , components required for manufacturing goods to be supplied against international tenders , &quot; he added . 
Dar said exporters would also be allowed to import , duty free , textile designs , artwork and transparencies up to 0.5 percent of the value of exports . 
he also announced duty-free import of raw sugar for further exports after refining . 
&quot; This would save foreign exchange , utilise idle capacity of sugar mills and result in value addition , &quot; Dar added . 
Pakistan would open up the import of gold and silver , which was now allowed for only three companies , he said . 
&quot; However , foreign exchange for such imports will be privately arranged by the importer as per existing practice . 
he said most measures would be effective in a month , hoping the export of non-traditional items would register an increase of $ 500 million in 1997 / 98 and the traditional exports based on cotton and textiles to bring an additional $ 815 million .
