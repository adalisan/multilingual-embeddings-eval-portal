an extraordinary goal created by irrepressible goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert gave Paraguay a 1-0 win over Ecuador in a South American World Cup qualifying match on Sunday . 
Chilavert began the move with a clearance from his own penalty area , thumping the ball almost the entire defence of the pitch . 
the ball caught the Ecuadorean defence offguard and striker Miguel Benitez nipped in , headed the ball over advancing goalkeeper Carlos Morales , got to the ball first and then headed it into the net . 
the result put Paraguay second in the nine-team group , from which the top four qualify for the 1998 World Cup finals in France . 
Chilavert became a national hero in September when he scored from a free kick to give Paraguay a 1-1 draw away to Argentina in Buenos Aires . 
he has also scored seven goals for his Argentine club Velez Sarsfield this year . 
Paraguay had the better of the first half but found themselves under pressure in the second half and survived several scares . 
Ecuador , who have never played in the World Cup finals , suffered their second successive defeat after a promising start to the campaign which included a home win over Argentina .
