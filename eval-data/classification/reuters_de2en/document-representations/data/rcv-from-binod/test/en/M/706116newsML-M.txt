Greek stocks drifted below 1,500 points in scant trading on Thursday with investors remaining sidelined in the face of press reports that small brokers were facing liquidity problems . 
&quot; Investors are idling until the smoke around the liquidity problems of small brokers clears , &quot; said Dimitrios Parashou , fund manager at Vergina mutual funds . 
&quot; But the whole issue has been taken out of proportions because it concerns the operations of small brokers with limited retail clientele , &quot; he added . 
&quot; This event does not take the market off its course which is affected positively by long-term improvement in the macroeconomy and the corporate sector . 
Greece &apos;s tax authorities are reportedly looking into these cases but no official statement has been issued yet . 
&quot; I firmly believe that the market will come out stronger of this hiccup just as the late 1996 incident that involved Delta Securities boiled into this year &apos;s rally , &quot; he said . 
Fund managers said prospects for equity investments remained favourable despite temporary blips in short-term rates and inflation . 
&quot; There are excellent prospects for Greek stocks in view of lower long-term interest rates and consumer price inflation , &quot; Parashou said . 
&quot; The rise in short-term rates and the resurgence of CPI inflation in June reflect temporary conditions , not a permanent change in fundamentals , &quot; he added . 
June CPI inflation , expected to be officially released on Friday , was seen rising to around 5.5 - 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in May , a government source told Reuters .
