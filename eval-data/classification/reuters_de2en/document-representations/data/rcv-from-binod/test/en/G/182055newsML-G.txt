cholera has broken out at a hillside settlement of about 250,000 Rwanda Hutu refugees outside the Zairean town of Bukavu and could wipe out the entire population within days , a U.N. doctor said on Tuesday . 
Walter Bonifazio , a medical doctor with the U.N.-funded agency Doctors in catastrophic Situations , told Reuters that the refugees were trapped at the village of Mwenga , 200 kms ( 120 miles ) west of Bukavu . 
&quot; cholera broke out at Mwenga on Saturday night , but there is also dysentery and malnutrition . 
this , put together with the conditions of the 250,000 people , is like putting fuel on fire , &quot; he said . 
Bonifazio was evacuated from Bukavu at the end of October and said his information was based on radio reports reaching his expatriate colleagues who are still working at Bukavu hospital . 
he said he believed several people had already died , but he had no exact figures . 
the Hutu refugees fled camps in eastern Zaire after fighting erupted earlier this month between Tutsi rebels and the government army . 
&quot; The human loss will be impossible to calculate , it is a bomb , and the people will die like flies unless help reaches them soon , &quot; he added .
