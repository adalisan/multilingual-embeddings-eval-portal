the Taiwan dollar reversed its early downturn to close firmer on Monday as exporters &apos; U.S. dollar sales outweighted importers &apos; U.S. dollar demand , dealers said . 
Saturday was a market holiday . 
dealers attributed the Taiwan dollar &apos;s early fall to U.S. dollar &apos;s recent overseas strength and importers &apos; demand for greenback . 
&quot; Exporters &apos; U.S. dollar sales emerged later in the day , pushing the rate to a higher close , &quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank . 
dealers expected the local currency to move in a narrow T $ 27.53-56 range on Tuesday .
