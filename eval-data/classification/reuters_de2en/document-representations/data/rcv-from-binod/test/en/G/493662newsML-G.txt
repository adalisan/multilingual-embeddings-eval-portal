a week after Brazilian television showed videotaped scenes of police brutality , a human rights report published on Tuesday affirmed that police violence is common in Brazil and hardly ever punished . 
the 120-page report , &quot; Police brutality in Urban Brazil &quot; , by Human Rights Watch / Americas examines about three dozen cases of police violence and concludes that beatings , torture and summary executions are all-too-common practices by police . 
&quot; This ( the video ) is not an isolated incident , &quot; said James Cavallaro , Human Rights Watch / Americas &apos; Brazil representative . 
&quot; Police officers are underpaid , poorly trained and encouraged to be violent , but impunity is the single most important factor driving police violence . 
the amateur video broadcast by Globo television showed a group of Sao Paulo police officers who used their batons to beat and extort money out of drivers at a roadblock . 
it triggered widespread outrage throughout Brazil . 
the video also showed how police tortured and intimidated civilian occupants of a car and finally fired at the vehicle . 
authorities later confirmed that Mario Jose Josino , who was in the back seat , died in a hospital as a result of the shooting . 
the 10 policemen in the video have been charged with murder , battery , graft and conspiracy and face up to 30 years in prison if found guilty . 
the outcry caused by that videotape prompted President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to sign a decree on Monday establishing a human rights watchdog and sanction a bill making torture a crime for the first time . 
the image of the police was further battered on Monday when Globo television broadcast another video showing more police brutality . 
the latest video showed military policemen beating a group of men lined up against a wall in a poor Rio de Janeiro suburb . 
the Human Rights Watch / Americas report said Brazilian authorities not only failed consistently to curb police violence but in some cases even introduced policies that tolerated or promoted grave violations of human rights . 
&quot; In Rio de Janeiro , police officers that engage in acts described as bravery are eligible for promotions and pay rises , even when those acts include extrajudicial executions , &quot; Cavallaro said . 
police statistics show that during the period of these incentives the number of civilians killed by the military police soared from 3.2 per month to 20.55 , the report said . 
in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte , Maurilio Pinto de Medeiros was kept in charge of the state &apos;s police forces despite ample evidence that he coordinated a death squad , Cavallaro said .
