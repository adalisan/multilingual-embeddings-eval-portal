Britain &apos;s main opposition Labour Party on Monday reaffirmed its determination to hound the government right up to polling day , while the ruling Conservatives said they were confident they could avoid an early general election . 
as MPs returned from the Christmas recess for what will be at most a 12-week session , Labour chief whip Donald Dewar said the main opposition party would pursue its policy of non-cooperation in Parliament to the hilt . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got a party on the government benches which is acting like an opposition , many of whose members have given up hope , which is literally falling apart before our eyes -- and therefore we are going to push and push , &quot; Dewar told BBC radio . 
labour gave notice before Christmas of its intention to suspend &quot; pairing &quot; arrangements -- which allow MPs to skip House of Commons divisions without altering the outcome of the vote -- after accusing Conservative whips of cheating to inflate the government &apos;s majority . 
as a result , Conservative MPs face the prospect of being pinned down at the House of Commons -- where the government no longer has a majority -- in case Labour mounts suprise voting ambushes . 
but cabinet minister Roger freeman said he doubted the guerrilla tactics would be effective , not least because MPs now have fewer late-night sittings . 
&quot; The government is quite determined and has the will to continue to the end of this parliament , &quot; freeman , the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster , told the same programme . 
he acknowleged the coming weeks would require a great deal of effort and discipline from Conservative MPs , but added : &quot; I am quite certain it can be delivered . 
we are in the run-up to an election in the next few months . 
&quot; The parliament can only run until May , therefore it is not asking an excessive amount of our own backbenchers to turn out ... to support the government . 
freeman noted that , for a vote of no confidence to have any chance of succeeding , Labour would have to ensure the full turn-out of all the opposition parties .
