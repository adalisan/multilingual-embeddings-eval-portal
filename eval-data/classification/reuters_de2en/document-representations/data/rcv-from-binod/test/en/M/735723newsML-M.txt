new Zealand &apos;s key 90-day bank bill rate had steadied at 8.46 percent by late Friday morning after peaking at 8.63 percent in early trade as the currency plunged over one U.S. cent to a low of US $ 0.6467 . 
the 90-day rate rocketed over 90 basis points higher than its 7.70 percent close on Thursday in an effort to offsett the kiwi &apos;s decline and keep monetary conditions at a level acceptable to the Reserve Bank . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen debt markets respond as the Reserve Bank would have hoped they would respond to the weak currency , &quot; said Jim Reardon , senior manager domestic markets at ANZ Investment Bank . 
the Monetary Conditions Index , which measures the mix of the exchange rate and the 90-day rate , opened more than 100 basis points below the RB &apos;s desired level of 825 in the September quarter . 
Reardon said some buying interest come back into the currency in 
late morning trade . 
&quot; So interest rates have taken some comfort from that , but any renewed selling would see renewed selling in interest rates as well . 
he said rates would continue to rise if the currency fell further in order to keep monetary conditions broadly in line with the Reserve Bank &apos;s wishes . 
&quot; Until such time as the Reserve Bank comes out and condones such a move I would expect the market to respond in the appropriate fashion . 
&quot; I believe if the kiwi continues to go lower then interest rates will go higher , &quot; he said .
