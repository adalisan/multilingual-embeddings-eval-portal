Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan said on Tuesday his government was in &quot; absolute control &quot; of the South Pacific nation and that the rebel army chief who demanded his resignation had stood down . 
Chan told a news conference that a police investigation was underway into Brigadier-General Jerry Singirok &apos;s action , which he said was &quot; gross insubordination and bordering on treason &quot; . 
Chan said the new acting defence force chief , Colonel Alfred Aikung , had reported that all army and police units were in complete support of the government . 
Chan said that 40 foreign mercenaries , detained by Singirok on Monday , would be released later on Tuesday . 
most of the mercenaries are South African veterans . 
&quot; All the disciplinary members ( army and police ) of this country have pledged their support to the government of this country , &quot; Chan said . 
&quot; The institution of democracy is very much alive ... in this country . 
Chan said the planned mercenary operation against rebels on Bougainville island , which sparked Singirok &apos;s move against him on Monday , would go ahead .
