Indonesia &apos;s ruling Golkar party said on Wednesday it had sent a letter to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , expressing gratitude for the break-up of an East Timor conference in Kuala Lumpur last weekend . 
&quot; The clear action is a reflection the relationship between Indonesia and Malaysia is indeed going ahead well and in a positive way . 
we are not interfering in the problems of each nation , &quot; Golkar General Chairman Harmoko told the state-run TVRI television . 
a youth mob allied to the Malaysian government smashed into the Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor II in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday , overturning furniture and manhandling participants . 
the conference was called to draw international attention to the plight of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor , which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year , a move never recognised by the United Nations . 
the Malaysian government had objected to the conference , saying it could harm ties with neighbouring Indonesia , but stopped short of banning it . 
a Malaysian court on Wednesday ordered 10 local human rights activists to spend another three days in jail so police could continue investigating the break-up of the event . 
the 10 were among 13 Malaysian activists still in jail after the incident . 
some 56 Malaysian activists and journalists have been released from jail this week following the disruption and another 46 foreign participants were deported . 
seven of the youth group demonstrators were detained on Saturday . 
all were released a few hours later .
