rebels in eastern Zaire on Monday denied allegations of large-scale massacres of Hutus in areas they control and invited foreign observers to visit . 
&quot; The talk of massacres is absolute lies , and we have no idea about it , &quot; the rebel group &apos;s justice minister , Mwenze Kongolo , told Reuters . 
&quot; We were already talking to the international community about sending investigators on human rights and we are still talking about it . 
a statement released on Sunday by the Association for the Defence of Human Rights in Zaire ( Azadho ) , Zaire &apos;s main human rights group , alleged atrocities by the rebels , many of whom are Tutsis , since they captured much of Zaire &apos;s North and South Kivu provinces last November . 
the statement cites dates , places and groups of witnesses to back Azadho &apos;s charges against Laurent Kabila &apos;s rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo ( ADFL ) and its alleged Rwandan and Ugandan army backers . 
&quot; Azadho is profoundly concerned by increasingly persistent information , corroborated and reliable information , which testifies to the existence of mass graves in territory occupied by the AFDL , and particularly their allies from the Rwandan and Ugandan armies , &quot; the statement said . 
Azadho president Guillaume Ngefa Atondoko told Reuters in Kinshasa the organisation had maintained representatives in eastern Zaire since the oubreak of fighting four months ago . 
Azadho , affiliated to the International Commission of Jurists in Geneva and Zaire &apos;s most respected human rights group , has been a harsh critic of Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko since the group was founded in the late 1980s . 
the declared objective of the rebels is to overthrow Mobutu &apos;s 31-year rule in the Central African nation . 
last week Belgium said it was alarmed by reports of a second genocide taking place in Central Africa &apos;s Great Lakes region , this time in areas occupied by the mainly Tutsi rebels . 
an estimated 800,000 Tutsis were massacred in a 1994 genocide in Rwanda blamed on majority Hutus who then fled to eastern Zaire , setting the stage for the conflict there today . 
Azadho says the principal authors of the massacres of Zairean and Rwandan Hutus were Tutsis who lost relatives in the genocide and who make up an important part of the rebel force . 
together with Tutsis whose relatives were killed or chased out of the Masisi region of eastern Zaire by extremist Rwandan Hutus backed by the Zaire army in 1995 and 1996 , Azadho says these elements of the ADFL rebel alliance have pursued Hutus in eastern Zaire relentlessly . 
&quot; Under the pretext of pursuing and punishing those responsible for the 1994 genocide , these troops have committed large-scale killings in the zones of Masisi and Rutshuru , targeting all members of the Hutu ethnic group , both Zairean and refugees , even children and even babies , &quot; the statement says . 
&quot; Massacres , torture , disappearances , and arrests have been perpetrated with such meticulousness that the Azadho section in North Kivu speaks of a veritable genocide of Hutus by the coaliion of AFDL and Rwandan soldiers , &quot; it adds . 
the site for one mass grave containing several hundred corpses of Hutu refugees in the Masisi region was pinpointed to the field of a named coffee farmer in the commune of sake . 
grave sites at the refugee camps of Mugunga , Kibumba , and Katale , which were emptied when up to half a million Hutus returned home to Rwanda last December , were also detailed .
