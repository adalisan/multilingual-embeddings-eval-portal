Irish government bonds edged up in thin late trade on Friday as the market focus switched away from international interest rates and turned to the international currency markets , dealers said . 
&quot; We have slightly out-performed gilts and bunds on the day but really the relativities have not changed that much . 
activity has been very light , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; Most of the response to the Bundesbank &apos;s decision to cut its repo rate by 30 basis points occurred on Thursday , with a lot of short-covering at the short-end . 
market focus has switched to currencies , particularly the dollar , &quot; the dealer added . 
by 1513 GMT , the 8.00 percent bond due 2000 had risen five pence from Thursday &apos;s close at 104.00 to yield 6.74 percent while the 8.00 percent bond due 2006 had risen 10p from the close at 103.15 to yield 7.41 percent . 
the key one-month money rate was at 5.56 / .69 , unchanged from Thursday &apos;s close . 
dealers said market focus was likely to remain on the U.S. over the short-term . 
&quot; If the dollar &apos;s fortunes improve , it will improve because of internal factors in the States . 
people will be looking for a lead from the U.S. next week , &quot; the dealer said . 
the dollar remained in tight ranges in late European trade , bumping along the session lows and unruffled by a jump in U.S. July durable goods orders . 
the orders rose 1.6 percent against an average of a 0.3 percent rise and a revised figure of a 0.2 percent fall in June .
