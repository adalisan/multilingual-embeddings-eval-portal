Middle East crisis divides United States and European allies . 
Russian tanks crush uprising . 
today &apos;s news headlines ? 
no . 
these were crises that erupted 40 years ago in Egypt and Hungary , events that are still remembered now because they changed the world . 
October 1956 was one of the most fateful months in 20th century history . 
in that month , Britain and France plotted to retake the Suez canal by force after the waterway -- a vital artery for international shipping connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea -- was nationalised by Egypt . 
their humiliating failure , in the face of condemnation from both the United States and the United Nations , changed the balance of power in the Middle East and dealt a mortal blow to lingering British and French delusions of imperial grandeur . 
in Soviet-occupied Hungary , the people were pushing for political and economic reforms . 
after some hesitation , Moscow ordered tanks and troops in to crush the challenge . 
desperate appeals to the West and the United Nations for help went unheeded , partly because Washington and its allies were distracted and divided by the Suez crisis . 
the Soviet Union had shown it was not prepared to loosen its grip on Eastern Europe , occupied since the end of World War Two a decade earlier . 
the NATO alliance , facing the new Soviet-led Warsaw Pact , had shown that it would not take on Moscow . 
as a result , the Iron Curtain that had fallen across Europe would stay in place for decades to come . 
these twin crises brought only bad news for Britain and France , once great powers that ruled much of the world . 
Suez and Hungary brought home that their dominance had been replaced emphatically by modern U.S. and Soviet power . 
Britain had already lost much of its empire , granting India independence in 1947 , and now faced a major rift in its special relationship with the United States . 
France had suffered a crushing defeat in Indochina just two years before Suez and was embroiled in a vicious colonial war in Algeria . 
&quot; The most important thing about Suez was the destruction of European power in the Middle East and the victory for Arab nationalism , &quot; said Ibrahim Karawan of London &apos;s International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) . 
since the turn of the century , Britain and France had occupied much of the region , redrawn its maps at will , supported rulers they liked and ruthlessly ousted those who opposed them . 
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser was determined to prove that the era of colonialism was dead and that the Arab world could be united and strong . 
in July 1956 , he nationalised the Suez canal , owned by the British government and French investors . 
London and Paris hatched a scheme to retake the waterway . 
as part of what most historians believe was a pre-arranged plan with Britain and France , Israel attacked Egypt on October 29 . 
the two European nations then issued an apparently even-handed ultimatum to both Egypt and Israel , demanding that military operations should cease . 
Israel accepted , Egypt refused and the two European powers were able to move in . 
on October 31 , they bombed Egyptian bases and airborne forces landed around Port Said on November 5 . 
there was a storm of protest from public opinion in Britain and France , the Commonwealth , the United Nations , the Soviet Union and from Washington , where President Dwight Eisenhower was entering the final stages of an election campaign . 
the combination of public and diplomatic pressure proved too much . 
the Anglo-French military operation was halted on November 7 and a U.N. peacekeeping force sent to the area . 
the episode greatly strengthened the cause of Arab nationalism and Nasser &apos;s claim to be its leader . 
he had faced down a challenge from the once-mighty imperial powers . 
Moscow cashed in as a major player in the Middle East , boosting its supplies of arms and economic help to Egypt and other Arab governments . 
the crisis also marked the beginning of major U.S. involvement in the region , turning the Middle East into another conflict between communism and capitalism in the Cold War . 
Eisenhower , who had won re-election , became alarmed at growing Soviet influence in the wake of Suez and announced in January 1957 that Washington would offer military and economic help to Middle Eastern states that felt threatened by communism . 
with a wary eye on the troubles in Hungary , the Soviet Union also used the Suez crisis as the perfect distraction to crush dissent in Budapest . 
world outrage at the behaviour of Britain and France in the Middle East was used to good effect . 
NATO could take action only if the United States , Britain and France were prepared to act together to reach landlocked Hungary . 
but they were too busy feuding over Suez . 
&quot; Suez denied the West the moral high ground over Hungary and it also denied them the practical means of doing anything about it , &quot; said Paul Cornish of the Royal Institute for International Affairs ( RIIA ) in London . 
the popular uprising in Hungary , with demands for an end to Soviet occupation and the restoration of political freedoms , came three years after the death of Soviet leader Josef Stalin . 
in early 1956 , Stalin had been denounced by the new Soviet leader , Nikita Khrushchev , who appeared to promise a more liberal line and stressed the need for &quot; peaceful co-existence &quot; . 
as a result , many in Eastern Europe and the West hoped that the Soviet Union would relax its grip . 
on the back of a popular uprising , Hungarian Prime Minister Imre Nagy announced his country &apos;s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact in late October 1956 . 
for Moscow , this was too much . 
on November 4 , Soviet tanks and troops moved in and Nagy was overthrown . 
some 200,000 Hungarians fled the country . 
Nagy was arrested and later executed in 1958 . 
&quot; There was a complete loss of faith in the Soviet system , &quot; said Cornish . 
&quot; It really finished off any goodwill left over from the Soviet role in defeating Hitler in World War Two . 
twelve years later , in 1968 , Soviet troops again moved in to crush a similar uprising in Czechoslovakia and it was not until Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the 1980s that the Soviet Union finally loosened its grip . 
the communists were thrown out in a wave of revolutions that swept Eastern Europe and -- more than 30 years after the Hungarian uprising -- Soviet troops finally went home .
