hard currency B shares on China &apos;s two stock exchanges ended sharply down on Tuesday , with market sentiment severely weakened by falls in the past few days and the poor debut of a newcomer , brokers said . 
but domestic A shares closed up on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges on a technical rebound supported by market speculation that Beijing might slow new share issues in the wake of the recent losses , they said . 
Shanghai &apos;s B share index ended the day down 2.841 points or 3.83 percent at 71.304 points on volume of 12.451 million shares worth $ 7.773 million . 
brokers said falls in the past few days , partly due to heavy new share issues right before China &apos;s takeover of Hong Kong on July 1 , greatly weakened market sentiment . 
&quot; The central government purposefully allowed a large number of companies with hundreds of millions of shares to debut each day in the leadup to the handover to curb speculation , &quot; said an analyst with a major Chinese brokerage . 
&quot; The markets are suffering from indigestion with current liquidity unable to quickly absorb the new shares , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The market lacked capital with foreign investors having little interest in buying , &quot; said an analyst with China Guotai Securities Co in Shanghai . 
brokers said China &apos;s moves to push domestic investors out of the B share market also hurt sentiment following a meeting held on Friday about the illegal practice . 
Bengang Steel plates Co Ltd , making its debut in Shenzhen , became the year &apos;s first stock to close its first day with losses , helping dampen sentiment , they said . 
&quot; Bengang fell below the offer price because no one wanted to buy shares in China &apos;s lumbering steel sector , &quot; said Peter Ho , an analyst at PBI Securities . 
&quot; The fact that a share ended its debut at a loss indicates a very bearish mood , &quot; Ho said . 
Shanghai &apos;s A share index ended down 14.993 points or 1.31 percent to 1,160.244 points and its Shenzhen counterpart rose 3.92 points or 1.04 percent to 382.27 points . 
the two exchanges each postponed the listing of an A share firm on Tuesday , citing &quot; preparations not ready for the listing &quot; as the excuse of the rare delay , brokers said . 
&quot; Investors speculated the move might mean the central government would slow down new share issues , &quot; an A share trader said . 
&quot; This helped the A share markets to a technical rebound in the afternoon , reversing the early losses . 
analysts said they expected the indices to fall another five to 10 percent in the short term if there was no major positive news to support the markets . 
on Shanghai &apos;s B share market , Shanghai Tyre and Rubber Co was the biggest loser , plunging $ 0.042 or 9.33 percent to $ 0.408 .
