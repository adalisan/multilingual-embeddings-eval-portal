German money supply growth , the German central bank &apos;s main policy guide , slowed to an annualised 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June , the Bundesbank said on Tuesday . 
analysts polled by Reuters had predicted seasonally-adjusted , annualised July M3 growth in a range of 8.5 to 9.2 percent . 
forecasts averaged 8.8 percent . 
the July figure remains well above a seven percent target ceiling . 
the German share market showed little reaction to the figure . 
in the bond market , where traders had become increasingly optimistic that the figure would come in below forecast , Bund futures eased marginally . 
but analysts generally warmed to the figure , saying it reinforced their expectations that the Bundesbank &apos;s main money market rate , the repo rate , could be eased soon , possibly as early as this week &apos;s Bundesbank council meeting . 
Uwe Angenendt , economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt , said in an initial reaction : &quot; Monetary expansion has slowed considerably . 
this is a very good sign for the Bundesbank on Thursday .
