a Columbia University doctoral candidate pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of kidnapping , assaulting and sexually abusing a woman student he met over the Internet . 
Oliver Jovanovic , 30 , was accused of tying the woman to a chair , burning her with candle wax and threatening to dismember her during 20 hours of abuse in his Manhattan apartment on Nov . 22 . 
judge Herbert Adlerberg allowed him to remain free on $ 350,000 bail and ordered that he return to court on Jan . 17 when a hearing will determine whether his computer , printer and more than 500 diskettes and CD-ROMS seized by police in his apartment can be returned to him . 
Jovanovic &apos;s attorney said the sexual encounter was consensual and that the two continued to exchange messages over the Internet after their meeting . 
the woman , a 20-year-old Barnard College student , did not go to authorities until two weeks after the encounter . 
she and Jovanovic had become acquainted in an on-line &quot; chat &quot; room . 
his voice barely audible , Jovanovic replied &quot; not guilty &quot; when asked by a Manhattan Supreme Court clerk to enter a plea . 
in an affidavit released on Monday by prosecutors , the arresting officer said the woman told him that after Jovanovic gave her some &quot; tea in a mug &quot; she &quot; felt dizzy and disoriented &quot; and thought he had drugged the liquid . 
the complaint also alleged that Jovanovic made repeated references to serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer , who dismembered his victims .
