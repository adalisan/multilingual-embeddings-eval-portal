major Slovak shares closed mixed in sluggish trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange ( BSE ) on Wednesday , with gains to shares of oil refiner Slovnaft pushing the SAX index up 2.89 points to 191.92 . 
Slovnaft closed up 40 crowns at 880 , while steel maker VSZ dominated floor trading closing unchanged at 640 crowns with 5,650 shares traded . 
brokers said they were encouraged by a wider range of issues trading , but said the market had been suffering from a dearth of direct trading over the floor sessions . 
&quot; We see the overall liquidity gradually rising , but it does not help transparency at all if it comes this way ( from off-market trades ) , &quot; Dusan Sykora of ING Barings said . 
he also warned that Slovnaft &apos;s price might be overvalued . 
brokers said they expected lively trading in VSZ , as investor demand for the issue at its present price increases . 
overall volume fell to 251,169 shares from 664,542 shaes traded on Tuesday , while turnover decreased to 136.28 million crowns from 304.42 million .
