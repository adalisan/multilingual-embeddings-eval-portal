the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said on Thursday its latest forecasts assumed higher inflationary pressures from housing than previously . 
&quot; We &apos;ve built in somewhat higher inflationary pressures in the housing market over the next few quarters than we had previously , and I think that &apos;s being driven partly by indications that the housing market is still alive and well , but partly also of course because the mix of monetary conditions has changed for somewhat lower interest rates than we assumed back in December , &quot; Reserve Bank Governor Don brash said . 
chief Economist David Mayes said the forecasts assumed that construction costs in the CPI would rise by a total of about 12 percent over the years to March 1999 . 
&quot; What we assumed last time was four percent , so that &apos;s the change in our assumptions , &quot; Mayes said .
