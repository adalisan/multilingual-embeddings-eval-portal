fresh reports Friday showed the U.S. economy bubbling ahead with considerable momentum after a vigorous entry into 1997 , possibly boosting chances of more interest rate hikes to cool the pace of growth . 
the Commerce Department said new-home sales eased down fractionally last month by 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000 from a revised 817,000 in January -- the first two months in a row in which sales topped 800,000 in nearly a decade . 
housing has been an exceptionally strong contributor to the economy , now in its seventh year of expansion from the last recession in 1990-91 . 
construction activity and sales of used or previously occupied homes also has been brisk . 
in a separate report , Commerce said slightly less strong consumer spending than it previously thought caused it to revise down its estimate of fourth-quarter growth in national economic output . 
gross domestic product or GDP , the broadest measure of total economic activity within U.S. borders , expanded at a 3.8 percent annual rate in the three months from last October through December istead of 3.9 percent , the government said . 
that was still nearly double the third quarter &apos;s 2.1 percent rate of expansion . 
many analysts see GDP continuing to grow at around a 3 percent annual rate in the current first quarter that ends on Monday . 
&quot; There &apos;s virtually no doubt that GDP continues running above what the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) has set out as its central tendency for this year of 2-to-2-1 / 4 percent growth , &quot; said Ken Mayland , Cleveland-based economist for KeyCorp . 
this week , the U.S. central bank &apos;s policysetting Federal Open Market Committee decided to nudge up short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point -- an action that ripples through the economy in the form of costlier credit -- out of concern strong consumer demand might fire up dangerous inflationary pressures . 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated that he considers the economy can safely go on growing at around 2 percent to 2-1 / 4 percent a year without risk of large wage and price rises that could derail the long-running expansion . 
but growth was well above that as 1996 closed and appeared certain to remain above it in the current quarter . 
&quot; GDP is down slightly but it still shows a very strong quarter at the end of last year that &apos;s carried over to this year and that is what has caught the Fed &apos;s attention , &quot; said Paul Taylor , an economist with America &apos;s Community Bankers . 
commerce said it scaled back back its fourth-quarter GDP estimate because , based on new information from hospitals for November , consumer spending on services like medical care were slightly lower than it previously thought . 
the new-home sales report showed that the supply of homes on the market fell to the lowest level in more than three years during February . 
that suggested brisk building activity ahead as the key spring selling-season usually adds impetus to homebuying . 
at last month &apos;s sales pace , there were just 4.6 months &apos; worth ready to sell -- lowest since 4.5 months in December 1993 and under January &apos;s 4.8 months &apos; supply . 
February sales of new homes were 3.5 percent above levels a year earlier , in February 1996 when sales were at a rate of 778,000 . 
analysts noted that , since the Fed acted Tuesday to boost interest rates , there has already been a move upward in all types of rates and that may help tamp down demand . 
&quot; I would guess that the rise in rates that we &apos;ve seen recently will take some steam out of the housing numbers but not a whole lot of steam , &quot; Mayland said . 
he added there was potential for a more abrupt slowing if higher rates sparked a retrenchment in the high-flying stock market that has made consumers feel richer and more able to finance a home . 
on Thursday , the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing , or previously occupied , homes shot up to the second highest level on record last month as a growing economy boosted buyer activity . 
the industry lobby group said sales of existing homes rose 9.0 percent in February to a seasonably adjusted annual rate of 4.26 million units from a revised 3.91 million units in January . 
for new homes , the only region where February sales increased was the West , where they rose 11.7 percent to an annual rate of 210,000 . 
in the Northeast , sales dropped 11.2 percent to 95,000 a year during February and in the Midwest they were down 3.4 percent to 141,000 . 
sales also fell in February by 3.4 percent in the South , the nation &apos;s biggest housing market , to 364,000 a year .
