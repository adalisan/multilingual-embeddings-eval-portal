a total of 139 Canadian soldiers in a U.N.-backed force charged with helping refugees in Zaire have left for home and most will be out by Monday , a spokesman said . 
the Canadian military spokesman said the 139 from the force of some 300 left for home this week and only 37 soldiers would remain at Entebbe airport to load equipment on departing planes on the last day . 
he said he did not know when the last day would be but the Canadians have said their mission will be ended by December 31 . 
the Canadian force came to Uganda and Rwanda in mid-November when the international community was pushing for a multinational force to intervene in eastern Zaire to help aid Rwandan refugees fleeing after a rebellion by Zairean rebels since October . 
the United Nations ordered the Canadians to pull out last Saturday despite aid agencies saying hundreds of thousands of refugees and Zairean displaced in eastern Zaire still needed help . 
but U.N. officials said the need for the force diminished when hundreds of thousands of refugees trekked home from Zaire . 
only Canada contributed troops and equipment to the multinational force . 
the United States , Britain , Italy , Holland , Belgium and South Africa sent liaison officers but did not join . 
the force , under the command of Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril , was unable to do much more than coordinate data from aerial searches for refugees and prepare plans for aid airdrops .
