Brazil &apos;s Finance Ministry wants to offer below-market-rate loans to medium-sized businesses which will be able to use the money to finance cash flow , Economic Policy Secretary Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros said in a newspaper interview published on Tuesday . 
under the plan , the National Development Bank ( BNDES ) would issue debentures to institutional investors and use the funds for low-interest loans to medium-sized businesses , Mendonca de Barros told O Globo newspaper . 
currently , BNDES offers subsidized loans to medium-sized firms only if they use the money for investment , not to finance their cash flows . 
the idea must be approved by Brazil &apos;s National Monetary Council , Mendonca de Barros said .
