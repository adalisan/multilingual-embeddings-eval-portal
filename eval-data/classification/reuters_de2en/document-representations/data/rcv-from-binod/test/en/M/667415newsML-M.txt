U.S. cash crude prices firmed to the end of Monday business , supported on an outright basis by nervous buying on when Iraqi oil exports would return to market and related technical movement , traders said . 
U.N. officials reiterated Monday that it was up to Baghdad to set the pace for renewed oil sales under the second phase of the oil-for-food accord , which officially began June 8 . 
Iraq remained insistent that oil would be sold only after a new distribution plan was in place , a process which was expected to be completed by the end of June . 
July West Texas Intermediate / Cushing closed around 15-20 cents higher at $ 19.05-15 a barrel , around 8-10 cents stronger than NYMEX settlement prices at $ 19.01 a barrel . 
lofty Exchange for Physicals ( EFPs ) premiums have been squeezed in recent sessions , leaving cash WTI benchmark with only half of the 20 cents edge it enjoyed the previous weeks . 
traders said the combination of Nigerian bonny Light being absorbed in the U.S. Gulf , and most refiners having finished their obligations deflated EFPs . 
the EFP strength has rested firmly on the belief July NYMEX expiry would bring about a slew of foreign crude deliveries against the contract , mirroring what happened for both the May and June contracts . 
&quot; July EFPs have come off substantially , getting us down to a tight market around a + 8 cents offer , &quot; a cash trader said . 
for the domestic grade barrels , Light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James talked late at a 12-10 cents discount to the marker , four cents firmer than Friday . 
traders said a number of refiners looking to shore-up their ratable barrel buying needs propped differentials . 
Midland / WTI ranged around a 38 cents discount , where deals were done in the afternoon , steady from Friday . 
heavy Louisiana sweet / Empire rested around morning deals at 35-40 cents under WTI / Cushing .
