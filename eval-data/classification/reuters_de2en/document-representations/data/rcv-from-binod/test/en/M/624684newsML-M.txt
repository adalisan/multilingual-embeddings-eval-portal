palladium and platinum after soaring to fresh highs during U.S. trading look set for a volatile and nervous trading on Thursday , dealers and chartists said . 
gold is likely to remain sidelined and trade below resistance at $ 345.00 , while silver is also likely to adopt a sideways trading pattern as attention centres on the PGMs . 
palladium - Market seen volatile after June contract prices surged to a 17-year high of $ 204.00 an ounce in New York trading on Wednesday . 
London traders said they expected prices to remain under $ 200 in European trading as profits are taken , though they did not rule out another flaring in prices when the U.S. reopens . 
&quot; It could head back to $ 200 or fall towards support at $ 180 ... the market is nervous and unclear at the moment , &quot; one trader said . 
tight physical supplies are likely to keep the market firmly underpinned . 
Russia has not shipped any of its 1997 platinum and palladium exports which has seen market operators scramble for any available metal . 
cost for borrowing palladium has moved to just above 40 percent recently . 
traders said there may be a pullback but did not expect a dramatic sell-off until the supply problems are sorted out . 
on the upside traders and analysts are finding it hard to pin down resistance levels given the recent unprecedented upside moves . 
&quot; At the moment levels just above $ 200 are pegged at resistance largely due to the fact that is where the market stalled in New York , &quot; one commented . 
at 0745 GMT spot palladium was quoted at $ 191.00 / 192.00 , against Wednesday &apos;s London close of $ 196.00 / $ 197.00 . 
platinum - tight nearby supplies are likely to continue to drive prices higher . 
in early trading platinum above $ 410.00 was around 14-month highs despite the ending of the strike at Amplats Rustenburg mine . 
&quot; It helped to bolster run away upside sentiment yesterday , though overall the strike was not that important to the market , &quot; one trader said . 
a lack of Russian shipments and general covering should keep the market on the boil . 
traders suggest that a break of $ 415 could see prices move to $ 420 / 25 . 
support was pegged at $ 400.00 . 
at 0805 platinum was indicated at $ 410.00 / 14 , versus $ 401.10 / $ 402.10 
gold - seen consolidating but may be lifted to test resistance above $ 345.00 on the coat tails of the recent gains in palladium and platinum . 
support at $ 340.00 and $ 339.50 . 
at 0805 spot silver was indicated at $ 4.73 , against $ 4.71 / $ 4.73 .
