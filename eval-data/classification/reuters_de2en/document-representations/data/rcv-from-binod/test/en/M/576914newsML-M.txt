the IPE natural gas futures contract saw no trade in the morning session on Monday , with bids and offers far apart in most periods . 
in some months there was well over a penny a therm between buyers and sellers . 
the blank session followed on from Friday afternoon , when there was also nothing done . 
this is thought to be the first time on which the IPE has gone through two consecutive sessions without a deal getting done . 
Monday morning was also quiet on the physical market , a trader said , following a quiet weekend when no activity was seen on the flexibility mechanism . 
Transco , operators of the mechanism , said on Monday that there was no flexibility trade on May 9 , 10 or 11 . 
the system average price ( SAP ) was , respectively , 0.4058 pence per kilowatt hour ( p / kWh ) , 0.4181 p / kWh , and 0.4231 p / kWh . 
this is equivalent to around 11.89 pence a therm , 12.25 p / th and 12.40 p / th . 
a trader said there were several demand changes posted over the weekend , with downward revision made on Friday but Saturday and Sunday seeing forecasts erratic over the day . 
&quot; The fact that there was no flex activity implies people were meeting their renominations , &quot; he said . 
warmer weather forecast for later in the week is expected to lead to a reduction in retail demand and so to a softening in prices following the sharp rally last week , a dealer said .
