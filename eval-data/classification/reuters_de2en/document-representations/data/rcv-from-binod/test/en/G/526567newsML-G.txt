the first troops of China &apos;s People &apos;s Liberation Army ( PLA ) were set to enter Hong Kong on Monday in a historic step towards the territory &apos;s handover . 
the 40-strong party led by Major-General Zhou Borong will drive into the British colony from China &apos;s Shenzhen region in full uniform but unarmed . 
they will drive to the Prince of Wales barracks in downtown Hong Kong , arriving soon after British troops have fired an annual , noontime 21-gun salute marking the birthday of Queen Elizabeth . 
they are the first of up to 10,000 PLA troops who will form the Hong Kong garrison after Britain hands its last Asian colony -- a bustling capitalist outpost of 6.4 million people -- to Communist-ruled China at midnight on June 30 . 
up to 200 advance troops are to be phased in before handover day . 
by that day , Britain will have phased out its garrison -- which once numbered up to 10,000 troops . 
the last of the Black Watch highland regiment will have flown out just after the midnight June 30 flag change . 
it is the first military presence China has been allowed in Hong Kong and a key step towards its assumption of sovereignty . 
they will go through normal customs and immigration checks and find their own way from the border , 30 km ( 20 miles ) to the Prince of Wales barracks , where 28 of them will be billeted . 
twelve will stay on nearby Stonecutters Island , where Britain recently closed its HMS Tamar naval base . 
&quot; The soldiers will be unarmed and are here to carry out practical preparations for the PLA to take over responsibility for the defence of Hong Kong on July 1 , &quot; British armed forces spokesman Roger Goodwin said . 
one of the first things they see in Hong Kong harbour will be three United States warships that are in the territory for one of the 70 or so rest and recreation calls the U.S. Navy makes each year . 
they have nothing to do with the PLA &apos;s arrival , &quot; a U.S. spokesman said . 
general Zhou will be greeted at the barracks by British garrison commander Major-General Bryan Dutton in a no-frills welcome . 
there will be no brass bands or bunting , spokesmen said . 
&quot; They will be greeted with normal courtesies , handshakes and salutes , &quot; said Goodwin .
