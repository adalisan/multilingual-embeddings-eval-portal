U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sold at $ 63.00 per cwt in light volume , unchanged from Tuesday but down $ 1.00 from last week , feedlot sources said . 
about 5,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area , which brought the week to date total to 79,300 , including 20,800 formulated and 1,000 previously contracted cattle to be shipped this week , USDA said . 
Kansas sales totaled 2,500 head , bringing the week to date to 49,000 , including 13,800 head or about 28 percent previously contracted or formulated cattle , USDA said . 
several feedlot managers said there were still cattle owners resisting packer bids at $ 63.00 because sales at that level would erase what little profits were left in the cattle . 
some cattle feeders were pricing cattle at $ 65.00 , some sources said . 
Feedlot cattle prices were pressured this week by lackluster beef demand and adequate supplies of cattle for the near term , sources said . 
light sales in Nebraska were steady with Tuesday &apos;s tops but down $ 0.50 to $ 1.00 from last week . 
dressed basis sales were quoted at $ 103.00 to $ 103.00 per cwt in moderate volume .
