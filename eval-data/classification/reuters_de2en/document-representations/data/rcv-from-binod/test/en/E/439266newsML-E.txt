the Venezuelan government plans to keep tight control on spending to ensure that inflation does not exceed 35 percent this year , Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff said Thursday . 
&quot; The government is going to keep very rigorous control over public spending so that the inflation goal does not exceed between 30 and 35 percent , &quot; Petkoff told reporters in Congress . 
Petkoff acknowledged that the government &apos;s original inflation target of 25 percent for 1997 had been disrupted by a recent 75 percent pay rise settlement with public sector workers . 
the decision to raise wages above the expected inflation level would help workers recover lost spending power eroded by years of high inflation , he said . 
inflation in 1996 was 103 percent .
