the Democratic Republic of the Congo said on Saturday it would host a summit on Sunday of African heads of states who have pledged support for President Laurent Kabila . 
government spokesman Raphael Ghenda said 10 heads of states were expected in the capital Kinshasa over the week-end for the gathering which would be devoted to &quot; African cooperation &quot; . 
&quot; We are expecting Zimbabwe , Namibia , Angola , Zambia , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi , Eritrea , Ethiopia and Ghana to take part in this meeting , &quot; Ghenda said . 
&quot; It will be a one-day summit and it will take place tomorrow , &quot; he added . 
Kabila grabbed power in May after a seven-month military campaign that put an end to the 32-year rule of president Mobutu Sese Seko , who has fled into exile from the country formerly known as Zaire . 
Kabila has pledged to reform Africa &apos;s third largest country after decades of economic mismanagement under Mobutu .
