Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Wednesday called a meeting for Thursday with representatives of the country &apos;s gypsy community as hundreds continued to flood the Canadian embassy with calls hoping to win asylum across the Atlantic . 
in the past week , Czech gypsies have flocked to Canadian embassies in Prague and Vienna after a local television report showed a gypsy family living comfortably in Canada while its case for asylum was considered . 
Ottawa &apos;s Prague embassy said it was continuing to receive a wave of calls , mostly from Czech gypsies in the eastern city of Ostrava who mistakenly thought Canada had a special asylum programme for them . 
the reaction to the report shown on the commercial station TV Nova last Thursday has grown into a heated debate in the media over attitudes toward the large and relatively poor Czech gypsy population . 
President Vaclav Havel said he was following the issue closely and was unhappy about the situation in Ostrava , where thousands have reportedly begun selling their possessions and withdrawing money to buy air tickets to Canada . 
officials at Canada &apos;s embassy in Prague said the report gave gypsies the false impression that upon arriving in Canada they would receive money and accomodation , and that their chance of getting refugee status was very high . 
Czech citizens are not required to have a visa to visit Canada although they must show a return ticket when entering and prove they have the means to finance their stay . 
Canada has no special programme for Czech gypsies . 
it follows the United Nations convention on refugees . 
Czech politicians have long wrestled with accusations by human rights campaigners and western governments that the country gives unfair treatment to its gypsies , who are estimated to total in the hundreds of thousands . 
gypsies have often been the target of violent racially motivated attacks , and there is a widespread belief that they are responsible for much of the country &apos;s crime .
