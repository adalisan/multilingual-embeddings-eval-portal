Britain &apos;s global trade deficit was unchanged at 1.12 billion pounds ( $ 1.75 billion ) in June , helping to ease fears that economic recovery may have damaged the trade balance , according to figures released on Wednesday . 
the Office for National Statistics ( ons ) said total exports fell slightly to 13.63 billion pounds and imports were also down at 14.75 billion . 
the figures were better than financial markets had expected but some City economists predicted that the healthier tone could prove short-lived , with rising consumer demand likely to boost imports in the coming months . 
the Treasury said the figures demonstrated the strength of export growth but some economists found them puzzling . 
&quot; Import growth has slowed despite abundant evidence of an upswing in domestic demand . 
even more surprising is the buoyancy of export growth , despite reduced competitiveness against major European currencies since the turn of the year and only tentative signs of a pick-up in overseas activity . 
Garrard said the trade data were notoriously erratic and the deficit could be revised higher in the coming months . 
the opposition Labour party said the trade deficit would overshoot the latest government forecast for 1996 of 13.5 billion pounds . 
&quot; These figures make clear the weak state of the British economy , &quot; shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Alistair Darling said . 
&quot; Britain has too small a manufacturing base to sustain growth without a persistent trade deficit . 
there was better news on more up-to-date figures covering trade with countries outside the European Union in July . 
this showed a July deficit of 506 million pounds , half of the June shortfall of 1.09 billion . 
economists said the figures probably made it slightly less likely that Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) Kenneth Clarke would cut official interest rates again next month . 
Clarke has cut rates four times since December to their present 5.75 percent level . 
with a general election due by May 1997 , he has a strong political incentive to lower them further . 
Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America said the figures should remove worries that the recent rise in the value of sterling against major European currencies could undermine exports . 
&quot; The smaller than expected July deficit is also positive for a pick-up in GDP growth this quarter , so another dent to rate cut hopes , &quot; he said . 
other economists said the deficit could come under pressure from a pick up in investment once industry has disposed of stocks of unsold goods . 
Britain &apos;s industrial base was eroded during the 1980s and a pick up in investment would lead to an influx of capital goods from abroad . 
the consumer recovery , on the other hand , may be less threatening as Britain now plays host to a large number of foreign consumer goods manufacturers and is expected to be a net exporter of televisions and passenger cars by the year 2000 . 
&quot; I still think the deficit will deteriorate as consumer spending picks up , &quot; said Ciaran Barr , economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell .
