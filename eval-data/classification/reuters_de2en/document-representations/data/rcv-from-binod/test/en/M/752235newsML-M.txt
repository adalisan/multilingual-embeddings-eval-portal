LIFFE wheat ended higher after a day spent following sterling , traders said . 
&quot; It was purely moving with sterling , &quot; one trader said . 
and an easier sterling against the mark enabled wheat to rise . 
but barley , coming under harvest pressure , ended easier . 
&quot; People would rather buy &apos; as available &apos; barley , so the buyers melted away , &quot; the trader said . 
active November wheat last traded 0.25 stg higher at 82.00 stg on volume of 140 out of 407 lots . 
but November barley last traded 0.45 stg lower at 77.05 stg on volume of 53 of a total 100 lots . 
by late afternoon , sterling was a pfennig off session highs as dollar / mark pared gains from six year peaks .
