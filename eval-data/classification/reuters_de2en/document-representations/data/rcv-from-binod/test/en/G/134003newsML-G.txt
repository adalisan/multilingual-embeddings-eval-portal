the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday unanimously called for a ceasefire and political negotiations in Afghanistan as fighting showed no signs of abating north of Kabul , the capital . 
and in an obvious reference to the radical Islamic Taleban movement that captured Kabul last month , the council &apos;s resolution denounced what it called discrimination against girls and women and warned of &quot; possible repercussions on international relief and reconstruction programmes in Afghanistan . 
the Taleban have forbidden women to work or attend schools and universities . 
in another development , U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that if a ceasefire were ever established , the international community should have a larger presence , with military or civilian observers as a minimum . 
&quot; In case of a ceasefire we have to provide a presence in Kabul so we can obtain the demilitarization of Kabul as a city , &quot; he told reporters after the council meeting . 
he said first something had to be achieved on the ground and then a group or an ad hoc combination of states could send observers . 
these , he said , could be a multilateral force or a group from Islamic organisations . 
but he told reporters after the council meeting that no plans had been set up and &quot; unless there is a political will among the Afghan parties it will be difficult to help them and our assistance will be limited . 
the council &apos;s resolution , initiated by Russia , called for states to refrain from interfering in Afghanistan &apos;s internal affairs &quot; including the involvement of foreign miitary personnel &quot; and to stop supplying arms and ammunition . 
but it did not impose an arms embargo , as neighbouring Pakistan had wanted . 
Members said an embargo would be impossible to enforce and would probably favour the Taleban . 
the resolution requested Boutros-Ghali and U.N. representatives to cooperate with interested states and organisations such as the Organisation of the Islamic Conference to promote a political dialogue . 
Pakistan has offered to negotiate a ceasefire . 
&quot; I am more than hopeful ( for a ceasefire accord ) because in principle they have all agreed , &quot; Pakistani Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar said in Islamabad . 
U.N. envoy Norbert Holl said on Monday he welcomed the Pakistan initiative but no single country could bring peace to Afghanistan . 
so far , the Taleban and troops supporting the ousted Afghan government of Burhanuddin Rabbani have put conditions on a ceasefire . 
Gen. Ahmad Shah Masood , whose ethnic Tajik forces hold territory close to the capital , has said that Kabul should be demilitarized first . 
Masood has formed an alliance against the Taleban with his former rival , Abdul Rashid Dostum , an ethnic Uzbek , who holds territory in the north . 
for the past week fighting has been confined to a 20 mile ( 32 km ) stretch of the main road from Kabul to the northern strongholds of Masood and Dostum . 
sponsors of Tuesday &apos;s council &apos;s resolution were Germany , the United States , France , Italy , South Korea and five former Soviet republics -- Russia , Kazakstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan .
