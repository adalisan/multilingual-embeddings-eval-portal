Greek singer Nana Mouskouri predicted on Wednesday that a European Union programme to help translate and distribute books written in lesser-known EU languages would finally be adopted . 
they are on our side now , &quot; Mouskouri , who became a Euro-MP in 1994 , told Reuters after the European Parliament &apos;s culture committee unanimously backed her report on the scheme . 
&quot; Maybe they didn &apos;t realise it is really not one way . 
books in English can be translated into minority languages too , &quot; Mouskouri said . 
last year Britain single-handedly blocked the 34-million-Ecu Ariane programme , which would provide EU money to promote the translation of books and plays from and into languages like Welsh , Basque and Gaelic . 
Britain said at the time that the scheme concentrated too much on translating and would be a waste of money . 
later , in a compromise designed to push the programme through , the Culture Council agreed to cut the programme from five to two years and axe its planned budget fivefold , to seven million Ecus . 
Mouskouri said she expected the parliament to endorse the draft decision , COM ( 94 ) 356 , on October 22 . 
it needs the approval of Euro-MPs and the unanimous support of ministers to become law . 
but she said she would urge the parliament to accept no less than 10.5 million Ecus , which means the bargaining with Britain is not totally over . 
&quot; Ariane is not so expensive but it is very important . 
it is about communicating knowledge , &quot; she said . 
Mouskouri , who sings in six European languages , said she personally preferred to read books in the original if possible but thought it was important to have good translations which respected &quot; the spirit , feeling and identity of the writer &quot; . 
&quot; There are no politics in this . 
how can we fight about culture ? 
&quot; she said .
