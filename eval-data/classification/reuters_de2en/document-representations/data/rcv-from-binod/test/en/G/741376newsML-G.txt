it could be stress , it could be drinking or bad diet , or it could simply be bad genes , but high blood pressure is affecting more and more blacks . 
researchers at a conference in London this week will debate why blacks are more prone to high blood pressure and what can be done about it . 
several teams of researchers plan to show evidence that small genetic differences mean blacks react differently both to medication and the effects of high blood pressure . 
one of the studies to be presented at the 12th International interdisciplinary Conference on hypertension in Blacks shows that Britons of Afro-Caribbean descent often suffer from undiagnosed high blood pressure . 
in addition , many of those who were under treatment for their high blood pressure were not responding to medication , Elijah Saunders of the University of Maryland and colleagues found . 
&quot; We were not surprised to see high blood pressure rates nearly twice that of whites , and we were not surprised to find a significant amount of obesity and diets excessively high in salt -- we have seen this phenomenon in African Americans , &quot; Saunders said in a statement issued in advance of the conference , which starts on Monday . 
but they were surprised by other findings . 
&quot; Not only was a significant amount of hypertension undiagnosed , but many people who were being treated had blood pressures that were not being very well-controlled by their medication , &quot; he said . 
Matthew Weir of the University of Maryland School of Medicine said certain types of blood pressure medicine seemed to act differently in blacks than in whites . 
&quot; There are ethnic differences in response to some medications and physicians need to be aware of this , &quot; he said . 
Weir will present a study that found blacks on a high-salt diet reacted better to the calcium antagonist israpidine than the ACE inhibitor enalapril . 
whites and Hispanics react equally to either drug even if they eat too much salt , his team found . 
high blood pressure can cause heart disease , kidney failure , diabetes and stroke and is a top contributor to death in the western world . 
about a quarter of all African-Americans have high blood pressure and it is up to twice as prevalent in blacks than in whites in the United States . 
few studies have been done on black populations in other western countries . 
blacks are also more likely to have severe hypertension and die more often from complications than whites do . 
John Thomas and colleagues at Meharry Medical College in Nashville , Tennessee , found that among men who went to medical school , 40 percent of blacks got high blood pressure by the age of 40 as compared to 18 percent of whites . 
few medical studies focus on or include blacks . 
Saunders said it was sometimes difficult to get blacks to participate . 
in addition , community health programmes often exclude blacks and they may not visit doctors as often . 
the conference is sponsored by the International Society on hypertension in Blacks , an Atlanta-based organisation .
