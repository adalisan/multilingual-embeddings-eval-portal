China &apos;s consumer price inflation rate next year is likely to be around six percent , slightly below the current inflation rate , the China Securities newspaper said on Saturday . 
China &apos;s inflation rate in the first 10 months of the year was 6.4 percent and is expected to be about 6.3 percent for the full year , the newspaper said . 
the year-on-year inflation rate last year was 14.8 percent . 
&quot; Consumer price inflation in 1997 will continue to follow the trend of this year and will continue to be at a relatively low level , &quot; the newspaper said . 
&quot; The overall consumer price inflation rate for the year will be about six percent , slightly lower than this year , &quot; it added . 
supply and demand in the marketplace are basically stable and there are no obvious imbalances in production or consumer products which could increase inflationary pressures , the paper said .
