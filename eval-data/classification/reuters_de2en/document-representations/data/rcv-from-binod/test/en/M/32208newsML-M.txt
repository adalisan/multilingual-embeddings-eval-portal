CSCE world sugar futures ended slightly lower Wednesday , correcting from 18 month highs seen Tuesday on a breakout of a two-month old range . 
&quot; Today &apos;s action was just a reaction on light volumes to yesterday &apos;s sharp gains , though the market remains nervous , after rumors Egypt bought 60,000 tonnes yesterday , in addition to its tender for white sugar today , &quot; Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka said . 
CSCE October sugar , which expires September 30 , ended off 0.06 cent at 12.12 cents a lb , after trading in a narrow range of 12.02-12.15 . 
the London white sugar market also slipped back , on position squaring ahead of the expiry of the October London contract on September 13 , traders said . 
there was also some disappointment with the small tonnage award in the European Union &apos;s export licences award , traders said . 
the EU awarded only 250 tonnes in its weekly export licences tender , after 16,000 tonnes last week . 
the backwardation in the CSCE October / March spread widened further to 0.47 cent from 0.45 cent Tuesday and 0.35 cent at Friday &apos;s close . 
&quot; We saw some selling ( in CSCE world sugar ) as producers took advantage of the sharply higher prices seen Tuesday and some selling by funds rolling long positions into March , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; But we expect 12.00 cents , basis October , to hold as support on scale down trade buying , &quot; he said . 
CSCE world sugar futures ended sharply higher Tuesday , seeing the highest levels for the October contract since January 1995 , after a breakout of a six week 11.40-12.00 cent a lb range . 
with the approach of the October futures expiration on September 30 , attention will once again focus on the loading pace at the Brazilian port of Santos , where logistical problems have frequently come to the aid of bullish traders , one analyst said .
