Namibia will not follow South Africa &apos;s decision to allow foreign currency accounts for Namibian residents as from July 1 1997 , the Bank of Namibia has announced . 
&quot; In the current macroeconomic environment , permitting private individuals resident in Namibia to open foreign currency accounts might exert undue pressue on the balance of payments &quot; , the bank said in a statement . 
therefore it would not follow the same route as South Africa . 
private individuals resident in South Africa can now operate foreign currency accounts with authorised dealers , or invest abroad a maximum limit of up to 200,000 rand . 
they may retain any form of foreign income , excluding export proceeds abroad or in customer foreign currency accounts , as well as invest in fixed property such as farms or holiday houses in Southern African Development Community member countries , subject to exchange control approval . 
the Bank of Namibia said it remained committed to the progressive relaxation of exchange controls . 
&quot; However , the sequence of events with regard to exchange control liberalisation should be followed with caution and with due consideration of the economic conditions prevailing at any given time &quot; , it said .
