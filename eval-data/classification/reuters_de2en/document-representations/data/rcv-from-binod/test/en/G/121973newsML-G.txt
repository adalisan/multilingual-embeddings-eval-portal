Amnesty International said on Wednesday it feared for the safety of about 200 Burmese refugees which it said had been forced back into Burma by Thai officials last week . 
the London-based human rights organisation said Thai officials forced about 200 Akha and Lahu refugees back across the border to their village in northeastern Burma on October 12 . 
Lahu and Akha are ethnic groups living in Burma &apos;s northeastern Shan State . 
&quot; While Amnesty International fears for the safety of these returnees , the organisation is also concerned that the Thai authorities may forcibly return to Myanmar ( Burma ) other refugees from the Shan State who are fleeing widespread human rights violations there , &quot; Amnesty said in a statement received in Bangkok . 
the statement also said Burmese soldiers interrogated and beat male villagers on October 8 to get information on the presence of Shan rebel insurgents in the village . 
the soldiers left the village but took the Lahu headman and two other men , who have not been heard from since . 
since early this year , about 20,000 refugees from the Shan State fleeing forced relocation and other human rights violations have sought protection in Thailand , Amnesty said . 
&quot; Amnesty International calls on the Royal Thai Government to allow these refugees to remain in Thailand until it is safe for them to return to the Shan State , &quot; the statement said . 
it said Burma &apos;s ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) has been forcibly relocating tens of thousands of villagers in Shan State in an effort to counter resistance from those supporting armed ethnic rebels fighting for autonomy of the Shan State from Rangoon . 
&quot; According to reliable and detailed reports , since early March 1996 the Myanmar army has forcibly relocated at least 450 villages , comprising some 50,000 people , in central and southern areas of the Shan State , &quot; Amnesty said . 
no Thai Foreign Ministry official was available for comment .
