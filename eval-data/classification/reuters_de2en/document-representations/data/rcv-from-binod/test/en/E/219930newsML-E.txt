Haiti &apos;s parliament has ratified two contracts with the Inter-American Development Bank ( IADB ) that will bring up to $ 77 million in soft loans to the impoverished country . 
&quot; This will help put the government on its feet , &quot; deputy Alix Fils-Aime said . 
the National Assembly approved the contracts on Tuesday night . 
the first , sponsored by the Economic and Social Assistance Fund , will go to building schools , infrastructure and irrigation systems in small communities . 
the second contract , sponsored by the Emergency Economic Recovery Program , will go to larger infrastructure projects such as roads , ports and electrical systems . 
&quot; The contracts were signed within the past year but the ratification of parliament was needed so the projects could begin , &quot; IADB representative Philippe Dewez said . 
projects are expected to start in January when the money comes through . 
they will be contracted out though private companies and non-governmental organizations . 
the terms allow 40 years for repayment with one percent interest for the first 10 years .
