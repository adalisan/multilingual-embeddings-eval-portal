the United Nations has returned to government rule several villages in Croatia &apos;s last Serb-held enclave , starting Eastern Slavonia &apos;s reintegration into the rest of the country , the state news agency Hina said on Thursday . 
the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia ( UNTAES ) had allowed the Croatian administration to take control of five villages in the southwestern tip of the enclave , Hina said . 
UNTAES head Jacques Klein informed the Croatian government of the handover in a letter on Tuesday , the agency added . 
a senior Croat official said the handover did not mean immediate resettling of the villages , apparently because they need restoration to be rendered habitable . 
&quot; ( Croatian ) refugees will return ( to the villages ) before Christmas , &quot; vice-president Ivica Kostovic told Hina . 
but Kostovic said the area would remain demilitarised and patrolled by joint Croat-Serb police units . 
Kostovic also said Croatia agreed with UNTAES that refugees would soon start returning to a number of other villages in the enclave . 
UNTAES , endowed with more than 5,000 troops , took over the region in January with a mandate to prepare it gradually for return to Zagreb rule under a U.S.-sponsored deal struck by leaders of Croatia and Serbia on the fringes of the Dayton summit last November . 
the mandate expires in mid-January 1997 but U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Tuesday said U.N. troops should stay until July 15 . 
he also recommended keeping U.N. observers in Eastern Slavonia until the end of 1997 . 
Croatia so far agreed to a three-month extension of the UNTAES mandate , but said it would allow another three months for the withdrawal of its troops before regaining full control of the enclave . 
minority Serbs captured the oil-rich and fertile Eastern Slavonia in mid-1991 at the outset of their rebellion against Croatia &apos;s drive for independence from federal Yugoslavia . 
they expelled thousands of non-Serbs from the region . 
Croatia &apos;s army recaptured all other Serb-held areas in 1995 .
