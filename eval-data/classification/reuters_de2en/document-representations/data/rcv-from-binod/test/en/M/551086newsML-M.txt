Pakistan will issue a tender on Saturday for 315,000 tonnes of soft white wheat from the United States or Australia for shipment between May 20 and June 10 , an official at the Agriculture Ministry said on Wednesday . 
the official said the tender would be handled by Pakistan &apos;s embassy in Washington , ending the previous system whereby bids were opened at the Agriculture Ministry in Islamabad . 
he said the wheat , the first to be purchased under the government &apos;s plans to buy four million tonnes of wheat by next March , would start arriving in Pakistan in early July . 
the import target was subject to revision depending on a final estimate of the domestic wheat crop , normally available in September . 
&quot; This year we are trying to get the final estimate in by June , &quot; said the official , who asked not to be named . 
he said an end-March estimate put this year &apos;s crop at 16.334 million tonnes , down from last year &apos;s 16.907 million tonnes . 
he said opinions were mixed as to whether heavy April rains would have a positive or negative impact on the harvest . 
the official attributed the expected fall in production to a three percent drop in the area under wheat .
