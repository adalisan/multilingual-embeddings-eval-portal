London &apos;s August white sugar contract managed to retain most of its earlier gains after a mixed bag of sellers took profits after August / October surged to $ 10 , traders said on Thursday . 
Commission house and broker spread buying , especially from one French house , was cited as the driving force behind August &apos;s $ 3.10 rally to a high of $ 317.50 . 
but sellers were quick to move in to cap the gains and dragged August / October back to $ 9.00 and below , in a continuation of the sharp widening seen in recent days . 
some August flat-price buying was also seen from the trade and other brokers . 
at 1540 GMT August was up 70 cents at $ 315.10 , closer to its opening level of $ 315.00 . 
October was down 30 cents at $ 306.50 and volume reached a hefty 3,272 lots . 
crossed spread trades also boosted the overall volume , traders said . 
technically , August has surged through a series of resistance points since taking over as front month and breaking back above a trendline dating from mid-January . 
analysts noted that the spot price was now nestling against the 70-value overbought buffer as measured by its 14-day relative strength indicator ( RSI ) . 
&quot; While we have turned outrightly bullish , one must keep an eye on the levels of the RSI , &quot; said Darren Gurner , a technical analyst at Sucden . 
other indicators , such as short-term momentum lines , suggest that the bullish trend might continue for some time yet - as , measured over five and 10 days , both lines remain in positive territory and are sloping higher . 
slow stochastic indicators are edging towards overbought territory but as they are moving in parallel , analysts said it was unlikely they would cross yet and so signal a market reversal . 
the Paris market followed the trend set by London as spot August also backed off from its earlier highs . 
MATIF volume totalled 535 lots , with August up $ 1.60 at $ 316.00 and October down 10 cents at $ 306.50 .
