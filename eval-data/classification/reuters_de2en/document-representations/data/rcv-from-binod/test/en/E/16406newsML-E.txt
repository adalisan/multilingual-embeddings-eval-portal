Pavel Zhukov , macroeconomic department head at the Russian Finance Ministry , said the IMF was still worried about some elements of Russia &apos;s economic policy , but he hoped an August tranche would be paid . 
Zhukov said IMF officials had complained that 20 percent fixed-interest bonds issued to compensate elderly depositors in the state savings bank who lost money when inflation was high were not included in the 1996 budget . 
&quot; They have asked us not to repeat things where financing was not included into the budget , &quot; Zhukov said , adding that his comments represented his personal assessment of the talks . 
he said the IMF mission was also worried about a sharp rise in yields on GKO discount Treasury bills before Russia &apos;s July 3 presidential election . 
the mission complained that high yields were increasing Russia &apos;s domestic debt sharply , but Zhukov said the volume of T-bill issues did not exceed limits set by the IMF . 
the IMF was also worried about five trillion roubles from the central bank profits transferred to the government to boost budget income . 
Zhukov , who took part in the talks , said the mission seemed to be satisfied with Russia &apos;s performance of its obligations and said he still hoped Russia would receive the August tranche of the loan . 
&quot; We have reached understanding on all questions , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; The mission does not have claims that have an unsurmoutable character .
