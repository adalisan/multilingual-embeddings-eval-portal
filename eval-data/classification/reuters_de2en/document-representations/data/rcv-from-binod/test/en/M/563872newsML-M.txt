the mark was steady on its crosses at Europe &apos;s midday , moving little as a hike in key British interest rates made sterling the centre of attention . 
a near-term British rate hike had been well anticipated , but sterling shot up on the announcement , which came after the new Chancellor , Gordon Brown , brought forward his meeting with Bank of England governor Eddie George to today from Wednesday . 
&quot; The mark &apos;s blocked on the crosses . 
a soft dollar / mark is keeping it from dropping , but sterling / mark strength is keeping it from moving up , &quot; said a trader at a Japanese bank here . 
the main focus as far as the mark crosses were concerned were the political scenarios in France and Italy , traders said . 
the French franc came under pressure as opinion polls showed the opposition left closing in on the ruling coalition ahead of the May 25 / June 1 National Assembly elections . 
according to a Sofres poll , 37 percent thought the current coalition was the most capable of improving the nation &apos;s economy , while 30 percent favoured the Socialists . 
the mark was at 3.3744 / 49 French francs at 1112 GMT , off its session high of 3.3769 but firmer than 3.3737 / 39 seen in late Monday European trade . 
analysts , however , said this was not ruffling the market significantly . 
&quot; On the mark crosses , there seems to be a general consensus that if EMU is going ahead , there &apos;s a tendency for these currencies to move towards their ERM central rate , &quot; said Adrian Owens , international economist at Julius Baer Investments . 
&quot; So unless there &apos;s a huge political upset in either of these countries ( Italy and France ) , I &apos;m not expecting too much in the way of currency moves , &quot; Owens said . 
the franc &apos;s central rate in the European exchange rate mechanism is 3.3539 per mark , while the lira is pegged at 990 . 
in Italy , parliament is due to hold a confidence vote at around 1445 GMT on the government &apos;s mini-budget plan for 1997 . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi -- who has held 20 such votes since taking office a year ago -- is expected to win the motion . 
mark / lira was at 989.30 / 60 against 989.55 / 85 on Monday . 
the Irish punt was firmer although off its highs , after showing little reaction to the UK rate hike . 
the Irish central bank raised its key short-term facilities rate by 50 basis points to 6.75 percent last Thursday . 
the punt was at 2.5973 / 88 marks and 0.9180 / 80 sterling against Monday &apos;s 2.5740 / 40 and 0.9180 . 
there was little reaction to comments by Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher , who said Germany &apos;s economy would grow by 2.25 percent at the most in 1997 , and that he saw no need for a rate hike . 
the market also paid little heed to better-than-expected German unemployment data . 
the April pan-German jobless number rose a seasonally adjusted 8,000 , lower than forecasts of 15,000 although it was a turnaround from a drop of 15,000 in March . 
the German Labour Office said the economy remained too weak to bring much relief to the jobs market .
