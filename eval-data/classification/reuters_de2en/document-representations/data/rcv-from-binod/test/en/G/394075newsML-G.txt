U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in South Korea on Saturday for talks expected to focus on Korean peninsula peace efforts . 
she arrived from Moscow on the seventh leg of a nine-nation tour of Europe and Asia , her first overseas trip since becoming secretary of state last month . 
Albright was to meet South Korean President Kim Young-sam and Foreign Minister Chong Ha Yoo and then visit U.S. troops in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea . 
North Korea on Friday announced it would attend a briefing with the United States and South Korea on Korean peace talks , a sign the communist North was trying to put on a normal face after an embarassing high-level defection . 
in a brief statement by the Foreign Ministry , Pyongyang said it would attend the U.S.-South Korean briefing in New York on March 5 to discuss four-way peace talks involving China . 
North Korea twice delayed the talks earlier this month in what was seen as an effort to press Washington to provide more food aid for its hungry population . 
the United States insists it never promised Pyongyang a specific amount of food aid in return for North Korea &apos;s participation in the briefing . 
the four-way talks were proposed last April by Washington and Seoul to defuse tensions -- and eventually bring about a permanent peace -- on the Korean peninsula , which was divided in the 1950-53 Korean War . 
the two Koreas remain technically at war since the conflict ended in a truce and not a peace pact . 
earlier on Friday , North Korea announced the appointment of an acting premier to replace Kang Song-san , the sixth-ranked official in its power structure . 
the news set off new speculation about turmoil in North Korea &apos;s leadership since Hwang Jang-yop &apos;s defection in Beijing on February 12 . 
Hwang , the country &apos;s 24th-ranked official , was a close adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il .
