Aston Villa goalkeeper Mark Bosnich , at the centre of a storm after making a Hitler-style salute to Tottenham fans in a recent match , was found guilty of misconduct by the English Football Association on Friday and fined 1,000 pounds ( $ 1,660 ) . 
the Australian keeper was also severely censured , warned as to his future conduct and ordered to pay the costs of the F.A. 
Commission hearing . 
announcing the decision , F.A. 
spokesman Steve Double said : &quot; The Comission heard that Bosnich had been subjected to abusive chanting from the home crowd before the incident in the 48th minute . 
&quot; Bosnich told the Commission that his gesture to the crowd was intended as a Basil Fawlty-style joke . 
he was unaware of Tottenham &apos;s Jewish following and was devastated at the reaction to the incident . 
double added : &quot; He stated that he abhorred racism . 
the Commission decided that , while Bosnich &apos;s action was an act of stupidity , it was not his intention to cause offence or be insulting . 
&quot; He apologised publicly , quickly and profusely . 
villa manager Brian Little emerged from the hour and a half meeting satisfied with the outcome . 
he said : &quot; It has been a fair hearing . 
Bosnich was relieved with the outcome of the hearing , saying : &quot; What we have seen today is commonsense prevail . 
let &apos;s hope I can now put this incident behind me and go forward with my career . 
asked about the fine imposed by the Commission , he said : &quot; It &apos;s time to put this behind me there are far more important things going on than this case and to be honest I &apos;m sick of hearing my own voice . 
the outcome will come as a relief to the 24-year-old player who could have been suspended . 
but he is still waiting to hear if he will face police action over the gesture .
