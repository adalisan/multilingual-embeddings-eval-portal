afternoon trades were heard concluded at $ 114 . 
&quot; It is fairly slow , &quot; a trader said . 
high sulphur cargoes were notionally little changed , with support still seen from Romanian buying . 
an Italian refiner sold a small Jan-loading three percent sulphur cargo to another player , who paid a p + c floating price . 
low sulphur prices were weaker and traders said poor demand from Italy was a key factor behind the product &apos;s weakness . 
January low sulphur swaps were last heard traded at $ 125.50 a tonne , and traders said physical numbers were likely to be slightly above this level . 
but one trader at an oil major said he was offering a small early-January cargo out of Scandinavia , and it would be available for $ 125 or lower . 
he said he had seen buying interest from a trader who already held a cargo of low sulphur fuel oil .
