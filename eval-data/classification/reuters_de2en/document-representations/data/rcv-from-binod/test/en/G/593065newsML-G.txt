the left and the centre-right are neck-and-neck in the French parliamentary election campaign a little over a week ahead of the first-round vote , according to a poll made public early on Saturday . 
the Louis Harris survey for LCI French television found the combined left and the centre-right government tied on 39 percent each in the first-round vote of the May 25-June 1 election . 
the poll gave the ecologists seven percent of the first-round vote and the far-right National Front 15 percent . 
other recent polls have found the leftist opposition leading the governing coalition in the first round only to lose to the centre-right in the second-round run-off . 
that forecast was based on National Front voters whose candidates fail to survive the first round switching to candidates from the governing coalition in the run-off . 
the Harris survey , based on interviews with 892 registered voters conducted on Friday and Saturday , found 30 percent of voters believed they still might change their minds . 
forty-four percent of those surveyed said they wanted to see the centre-right prevail while 43 percent said they wanted to see the leftist opposition win . 
another six percent said they wanted neither side to emerge victorious and seven percent had no opinion . 
asked which side was most likely to win , however , nearly two thirds chose the centre-right . 
a slim majority of voters said they thought the election would have little or no impact on their lives .
