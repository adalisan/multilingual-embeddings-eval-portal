more than 70 members of an old Polish aristocratic family gathered outside the U.S. embassy in Warsaw on Wednesday claiming ownership of the land on which it stands . 
Members of the Czetwertynski family from all over the world submitted a letter to U.S. ambassador Nicholas Rey , saying the land was confiscated by the communist regime after World Was Two and then leased in 1956 -- illegally , they maintain -- to the United States . 
&quot; It is like with a stolen car . 
in a civilised country , if you steal a car from me and sell it to a third person , the car still belongs to me , &quot; Seweryn Czetwertynski , a 55-year-old businessman from Canada , told Reuters . 
Seweryn is one of 18 grandsons of Roza , the last owner of a fine palace that formerly stood on the disputed land . 
she died in 1949 , when the communist authorities imposed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin were clamping down on civil rights in Poland . 
two years after Roza &apos;s son , Stanislaw , was arrested by the communist security police in 1954 on allegations of espionage for Western countries , Poland and the United States signed an agreement on leasing the palace and land for 80 years , the family said in a statment . 
Seweryn said he was especially bitter that the U.S. government demolished his family home and build a glass and steel building in its place . 
&quot; I do not understand why the Americans took my father &apos;s palace away , destroyed it and erected something so ugly , &quot; he said . 
the U.S embassy confirmed that it had leased the property , in an elegant quarter of downtown Warsaw , until 2036 , with an option for a further 20 years , but said it had no part in the dispute . 
&quot; We regret the family &apos;s continuing , understandable anguish over this deeply felt issue , but their quarrel is with the government of Poland , not that of the United States , &quot; the embassy press office said in a statement . 
the Czetwertynskis declined to say if they wanted to claim their land back or seek compensation . 
they said in a statement that in bringing the matter to the embassy &apos;s attention they were &quot; counting on understanding and respect for the right of ownership as the fundamental principle of any democratic state &quot; . 
the Polish foreign ministry said the matter was now very difficult to resolve because Poland , unlike some other countries that shed communism after 1989 , had not adopted a law on returning property confiscated under the old regime to former owners . 
&quot; The 1950s were entirely different times ... , there was no respect for property . 
in 1946 , the authorities nationalised all Warsaw lands , &quot; ministry spokesman Przemyslaw Antoniewicz said . 
he said that under the current laws , which allow for returning former properties or granting compensation in some cases , the issue of the disputed land should be sorted out between the Czetwertynskis and Warsaw &apos;s provincial authorities . 
Andrzej Kowalczyk , an official at the Warsaw province &apos;s real estate department , said he could not comment on the matter because he was still studying relevant documents .
