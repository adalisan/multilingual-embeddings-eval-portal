Indian industrial consumers are watching the movement of copper prices on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) before placing orders with local stockists , dealers said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Industrial consumers are hoping that copper prices will fall further on the LME , &quot; said Sharad Parikh , president of the Bombay Metal Exchange . 
&quot; Besides , there &apos;s a poor offtake of copper in the local market because of a downtrend in industrial activity in general . 
&quot; The market is weak and will continue to be subdued in the next few days , &quot; said Parikh . 
copper prices fell 175 rupees to 13,700 rupees per quintal in the week to Wednesday . 
&quot; A revival in demand is not in sight even when prices are down , &quot; said Parikh . 
dealers said state-run Hindustan copper Ltd had not revised its prices down despite a drop in LME prices . 
India imports all non-ferrous metals with the exception of aluminium . 
the movement of LME prices has a direct bearing on Indian market trends . 
in the week to Wednesday , tin and nickel dropped 600 rupees and 400 rupees per quintal ( 100 kg ) to 29,200 rupees and 34,100 rupees respectively . 
last week , nickel and tin lost 900 rupees and 600 rupees per quintal respectively . 
zinc fell 50 rupees to 8,100 rupees per quintal . 
aluminium was steady at 7,700 rupees , and so was lead at 4,100 rupees .
