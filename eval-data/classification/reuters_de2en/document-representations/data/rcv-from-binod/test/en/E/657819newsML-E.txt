news that Swiss first-quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) turned slightly positive again after two years of steady declines offered a ray of hope to an economy struggling to get back on track , analysts said . 
&quot; I think what we cannot overlook is that for the first time in quite a while it is a positive number , &quot; said Klaus Wellershof , group economist at SBC Warburg . 
the latest data showed an increase of 0.2 percent versus the fourth quarter of 1996 on a seasonally-adjusted , annualised basis . 
it was the first quarterly rise since the first quarter of 1995 , when the GDP was up 0.9 percent . 
&quot; One should wait for two quarters in order to ... confirm the trend in the numbers , &quot; said Bruno Parnisari at the BAFK . 
but some negative factors remain in the picture . 
First-quarter GDP fell 1.0 percent versus first quarter 1996 , more than the 0.3 percent drop economists expected . 
Fourth-quarter GDP was also revised to show a 1.2 percent drop versus the third quarter , much weaker than the original report that GDP was unchanged . 
while economists said first-quarter private consumption showed some strength , and restocking typical in the first quarter was stronger than expected , imports also were higher than exports , and fixed-income investments fell sharply . 
exports remain a key factor for the Swiss economy and could strongly depend in future on the direction of the Swiss franc . 
a group of experts which advises the Swiss government , the Commission for Economic Policy ( KFK ) , said planned introduction of a single European currency continued to pose a risk . 
uncertainties about the shape and timing of the single currency tend to draw investors into the Swiss franc , pushing it higher . 
the Swiss National Bank has made clear it will add liquidity to markets in order to offset any rise in the Swiss franc which makes Swiss exports less competitive . 
&quot; It corresponds to the general view that there are signs of a light but very modest economic recovery , &quot; said SNB spokesman Werner Abegg . 
Zuercher Kantonalbank senior economist Martin Leber said the weakness in some GDP components could raise arguments in favour of further SNB easing . 
the SNB already said in May that it would add liquidity to the money market to offset a rise in the Swiss franc . 
since then , Swiss money market rates have eased by roughly 50 basis points to stay near the 1.00 percent discount rate . 
but Leber also said that he personally saw odds slightly favouring the SNB &apos;s keeping the discount rate steady . 
the weakness in some components of the data also reflected the impact of technical revisions which are tied to a new reporting format Switzerland has adopted to conform with the way official statistics are being reported throughout Europe . 
Parnisari at the BAFK noted , for example , that a sharp 8.0 percent drop in fixed-asset investments in the first quarter versus the fourth resulted partly from a re-evaluation of equipment which is imported , and then assembled and exported . 
revisions to 1995 GDP , now reported up 0.8 percent , as opposed to a 0.1 percent rise reported earlier , also had an impact on some of the 1996 quarters .
