Asian fuel oil prices are at their highest in 10 months and just below a five-year peak , but traders say a further rise might be difficult with more than a million tonnes of Middle East supplies due . 
high sulphur , benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil was assessed at $ 120.50 per tonne on Tuesday on Singapore &apos;s international market , just under its five-year record of $ 123.50 registered on January 13 , 1996 . 
traders in Singapore said the high benchmark Brent crude oil prices coupled with a firm European fuel oil market may propel Asia &apos;s fuel oil prices upwards to breach the five-year high . 
front month Brent hit a fresh post-Gulf War high on Monday on London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) , trading as high as $ 24.50 per barrel , surpassing the previous high of $ 24.39 . 
&quot; firm prices in the overall energy complex , triggered by the strong Brent levels , have placed firm sentiment and may cause Asia fuel oil prices to move higher , &quot; said a trader . 
high gas oil prices in Asia have caused major oil refiners in Singapore to optimise gas oil production at the expense of fuel oil , traders said . 
&quot; This may dampen fuel oil supplies and boost prices further , &quot; said a trader with a major oil company . 
but the supply of over a million tonnes of fuel oil from the Middle East was casting doubt on the potential for the fuel oil price rally to continue , traders said . 
traders in Singapore estimated between 1.0 and 1.4 million tonnes of fuel oil from the Middle East would arrive in the Far East in October . 
they said there were at least five cargoes from Kuwait , around eight from Iran , four from Saudi Arabia and one from Venezuela . 
&quot; Kuwait has increased its exports starting in October as domestic demand for fuel oil for air conditioning decreases after the summer season , &quot; said a trader . 
traders said they estimated that half the incoming cargoes could be resold , thus dampening Singapore market prices . 
the cargoes would add to current inventories in Singapore , which already stand above 1.5 million tonnes , one trader said . 
traders said demand from China was declining , dampening the possibility of a price rise . 
a trader with China &apos;s state trader SINOCHEM in Hong Kong told Reuters the company has already purchased its requirements for October and was unlikely to buy more . 
traders said buying interest from India and Indonesia has been soft . 
India has imported only 25,000 tonnes of fuel oil in October compared to a total of 100,000 tonnes seen in September .
