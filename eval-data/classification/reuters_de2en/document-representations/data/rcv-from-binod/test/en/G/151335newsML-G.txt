the head of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s Likud parliament faction warned of a &quot; holocaust &quot; on Tuesday unless Israel &apos;s government acted against Jewish militants in the West Bank town of Hebron . 
Israel &apos;s Haaretz newspaper said meanwhile that Shin Bet secret police head Ami Ayalon had &quot; expressed deep concern at the possiblity of confrontation between extremist settlers and Palestinians &quot; during an Israeli troop redeployment from Hebron . 
Israel and the PLO have failed in three weeks of U.S.-brokered talks to seal a deal on security arrangements that would pave the way for the partial pullback delayed since March . 
nonetheless , tensions are already high in Hebron . 
on Tuesday , Jewish settlers , shouting &quot; Hebron is ours &quot; , shoved , cursed and spat at Palestinian officials who toured the West Bank town , witnesses said . 
Michael Eitan , head of the right-wing Likud parliament faction , told Israel Radio : &quot; First , I want to say that in Hebron there are about 400 Jews whom the entire people of Israel should salute . 
but Eitan said the media and the Shin Bet spoke of elements who were threatening &quot; provocations &quot; . 
&quot; If people openly identify with Baruch Goldstein and continue to say another Baruch Goldstein will arise , I think they could bring a holocaust first and foremost on the Jewish public in Hebron , &quot; Eitan said . 
&quot; Against these people something has to be done , &quot; he said . 
Goldstein , from Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron , massacred 29 Palestinians as they prayed in Hebron &apos;s al- Ibrahimi mosque in February 1994 . 
&quot; Who knows how many Goldsteins there are around ? 
&quot; Baruch Merzel a leader of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach movement said to Reuters this month as he sat in his dining room opposite a framed portrait of Goldstein captioned : &quot; The saint Dr Baruch Goldstein &quot; . 
some 400 Jews live and study among 100,000 Arabs in Hebron . 
&quot; Dogs &quot; , shouted settlers among a group of 50 Jews who surrounded Palestinian Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbu , Ahmed tibi , an adviser to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and other officials near their enclave in Hebron . 
Israeli paratroops on patrol in the flashpoint town moved in quickly to separate the groups and shepherded the officials to their car which took them to safety . 
Netanyahu spokesman David Bar-Illan recently said there were plans for handling militants in the event of a redeployment they regard as betrayal . 
an Israeli security source said he had yet to hear of a plan though the Shin Bet watches the militants . 
Haaretz said the Shin Bet and other security forces had recently discussed Jewish militant threats . 
it said the security establishment was considering jailing militants without trial , a measure known as administrative detention and provided for under emergency regulations , and planned to prevent militants from other parts of the occupied lands and Israel from reaching Hebron during the redeployment . 
experts say the militants comprise a hardcore of about 70 Jews surrounded by several hundred supporters , with thousands more sympathising with their cause . 
Israel &apos;s previous government agreed in a deal with the Palestine Liberation Organisation a year ago to withdraw from six West Bank towns and partly from Hebron , the only one of the seven with Jews living inside it .
