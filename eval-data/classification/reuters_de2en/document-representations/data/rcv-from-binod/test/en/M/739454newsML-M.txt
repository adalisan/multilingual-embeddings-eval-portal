Belgian linear bonds drifted quietly in pre-holiday mode on Friday , although traders said activity picked up late in the day with German and French banks joining in the general selling of the shorter maturities . 
they said the outlook would be heavily influenced by the presentation of the French budget audit and a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , both of which take place on Monday when Belgium is closed for National Day . 
&quot; We are missing a lot on Monday , &quot; one trader said , noting that the market was poised to go in either direction with Bund resistance in sight and people preparing to take profits . 
traders said the day &apos;s activity in Belgium was even more focussed on the shorter maturities at the expense of longer paper than it has been in recent days , with money market rates remaining strong . 
&quot; The short end , two to five years , was heavily sold , &quot; one trader noted . 
the market has been holding up well despite recent releases of strong German and U.S. data , but it is starting to look toppish , according to some traders . 
&quot; We are owed a good correction , &quot; Conrad Fieremans at Kredietbank said earlier in the day . 
pressure for a downmove is expected to build up as evidence grows of a slow but steady , export-driven uptrend in Europe &apos;s economy , helped by the dollar &apos;s rise , particularly on currencies in the mark bloc , analysts said . 
Germany &apos;s IFO institute reported on Friday a rise in business confidence in June . 
some said there was also a downside risk to Monday &apos;s presentation of France &apos;s budget audit . 
&quot; How the government will cut the budget deficit to 3.2 to 3.3 percent without introducing an austerity plan beats me , &quot; one said . 
speculation centres on new corporate taxes rather than unpopular spending cuts . 
&quot; There has been lots of talk the outcome of the audit will disappoint , &quot; said Fieremans . 
the actual news might , as a result , spark some buying , but mainly of French paper . 
Paris government sources have said the audit would show the deficit at around 3.5 to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product , well above the three percent norm set out in the Maastricht Treaty on Europe &apos;s 1999 single currency project . 
Fieremans said France too would benefit from a pick-up in European growth , which would help it cut the deficit . 
meanwhile , the Belgian franc remained under pressure against the mark and money market rates stayed firm . 
in defense of the franc the National Bank has been keeping money supply tight . 
on Friday it cut its allocation on its fixed-rate tender for seven-day advances by a third to 10.025 billion francs . 
one-week repos were at 3.77 / 82 percent , well above the 3.00 percent interest rate on the seven-day advances . 
one analyst said the squeeze in the money market was beginning to affect funding conditions in the wider OLO market too .
