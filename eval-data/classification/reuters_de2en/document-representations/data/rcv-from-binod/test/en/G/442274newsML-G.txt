Romania should take tough action against corruption and organised crime if it wants early NATO and European Union membership , the country &apos;s president said on Friday . 
&quot; Romania cannot join the Euro-Atlantic structures unless it proves it can stop organised crime , illegal emigration , terrorism and so-called strategic crime , &quot; Emil Constantinescu told a seminar attended by police and army officers . 
the seminar was part of a crusade launched early this year by Constantinescu and the new centrist government headed by Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea to eradicate corruption , smuggling , fiscal and custom evasion which spread like wildfire after the 1989 collapse of communism . 
Constantinescu , who defeated ex-communist president Ion Iliescu in last November elections , called for &quot; tough action , to restore the population &apos;s confidence in the authorities . 
&quot; At stake is the future of our democracy , prosperity and the defence capability of the country , &quot; Constantinescu said . 
official data show money laundering caused losses worth 240 billion lei ( $ 36.4 million ) last year , when 20,000 cases of corruption , involving 7,400 people were investigated by police . 
a report by the Romanian Intelligence Service said in 1996 the black economy accounted for up to 45 percent of the country &apos;s gross domestic product . 
Romania , Eastern Europe &apos;s second largest market and military force after Poland , is expected to join NATO in a first wave of a planned enlargment expected to be announced at a NATO summit in Madrid in July . 
&quot; For seven years Romania was robbed and turned into a poor country , &quot; Constantinescu said in in reference to the former leftist government ousted in last November &apos;s elections . 
analysts say slow economic reform , loopholes in legislation , red-tape and the reluctance of legal institutions to fight crime had helped corruption become endemic under the former leftist cabinet . 
the war in neighbouring ex-Yugoslavia has also turned the country into a new Balkan route for smugglers of drugs , radioactive material , forged money and of illegal emigrants . 
in 1996 , police confiscated 5.6 tonnes of various drugs and 300 kilogrammes of radioactive materials . 
it also confiscated more than $ 550,000 and 590,000 marks in forged bills .
