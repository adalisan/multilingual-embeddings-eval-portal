the key March Japanese government bond futures contract ended up on Tuesday , but off the day &apos;s highs as a plunge in Tokyo share prices towards the close pared gains . 
buying of cash JGBs by some investors , such as city banks and public funds , triggered a rise in JGBs , a trader for a city bank &apos;s securities affiliate said . 
a sudden fall in Tokyo shares toward the close , however , dampened market sentiment to some extent , as it led to speculation among dealers that investors may sell cash JGBs to lock in profits and cover losses from their stock holdings , the trader said . 
&quot; No actual profit-taking was seen today . 
there has only been speculation about it , &quot; the trader for a city bank &apos;s securities affiliate said . 
the March ended at 124.11 , up from previous day &apos;s 123.73 . 
turnover was 38,785 contracts . 
in the Tokyo stock market , the benchmark Nikkei 225 average plunged 549.81 points to close at 18,896.19 . 
it was the lowest close since December 5 , 1995 , when the key index finished at 18,879.53 . 
the market seems to have mixed views about the effect of the fall in Tokyo share prices , a trust bank trader said . 
while some feel that weak Tokyo share prices will lead to profit-taking of JGBs toward corporate book-closings in March , others say that the fall in stocks shows the weakness of the Japanese economy and is a buy factor for JGBs , the trader said . 
other than some cash bond buying by investors , a rise in the yen versus the dollar in the morning invited short-covering of JGBs , the first trader said . 
the yen &apos;s rally against the dollar this morning was triggered by comments made by MOF Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka , who told a news conference that Japan will continue to deal with excessive currency movements in a proper fashion . 
yen buying began when Vice MOF minister Tadashi Ogawa said on Monday that Japan would keep acting appropriately to deal with excessive movements in foreign exchange markets . 
the yen &apos;s rise , however , has not yet dispelled fears of a &quot; triple weakness &quot; in Japanese financial markets in which the yen is sold as capital flows out of Japanese stocks and bonds , said another trader for a city bank &apos;s securities affiliate . 
the JGBs &apos; rise during the day was due to factors such as buying back of JGBs sold for hedging purposes towards the end of last year , and did not mean that the recent overall trend towards a triple weakness had been reversed , the trader said . 
the yield of benchmark 182nd cash JGBs was 2.575 percent as of 0729 GMT , down from the previous day &apos;s 2.625 percent . 
Japan &apos;s long-term prime rate is likely to stay at a record low of 2.5 percent in January , judging from current market levels , the third trader said . 
the yield of the Industrial Bank of Japan &apos;s ( IBJ ) December bank debentures stood at 1.75 percent on Tuesday , compared with its coupon rate of 1.6 percent . 
the IBJ will officially announce its long-term prime rate and the coupon rate for its January five-year bank debentures on Wednesday.--Tokyo Treasury Desk , + 81-3-5473-3748
