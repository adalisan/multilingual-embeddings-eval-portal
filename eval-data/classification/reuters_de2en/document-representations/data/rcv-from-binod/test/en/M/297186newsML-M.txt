the Bund market had a rush of news to contend with on Thursday but dealers said options on German debt remained listless . 
after a large drop in the underlying futures at the start of the year , they have range-traded since . 
implied volatility on Bund futures failed to pick up , having eased from earlier in the week , and business was relatively quiet . 
this was in the wake of German unemployment and growth data , which both underlined the soft state of the economy . 
it also followed news Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in hospital with pneumonia , but dealers said they failed to see any sign of options trading on the back of that . 
&quot; Vols have come off right from earlier in the week because the futures have been so quiet , &quot; a trader at a U.S. house said . 
Vols on February options on March futures were trading around 5.60 / 5.75 percent , down from around 6.00 percent late on Wednesday . 
March vols eased to 5.90 / 6.00 percent from nearly 6.20 percent . 
April and June were both quoted around 5.80 / 5.90 percent , not far from Wednesday levels . 
&quot; It was pretty perky on the open , but it &apos;s tended to settle down after the German unemployment figures , &quot; said a broker at a French house . 
&quot; Now it ( volatility ) is starting to drift off . 
there was some trade in 100.50 calls by U.S. banks , which one dealer said was down more to tidying up positions initiated last week rather than any directional play on the back of the day &apos;s events . 
March Bund futures tumbled on January 2 to a 99.28 low from a 100.33 open and high . 
since then they have settled into a comfortable range from 99.30 to around 100.00 . 
earlier Germany &apos;s Federal Labour Office said German unemployment rose 48,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.156 million in December . 
meanwhile the German statistics office in Wiesbaden said the economy grew a real 1.4 percent in 1996 , which was slower than economists &apos; predictions . 
the figures , showing a lacklustre economy , were broadly supportive of the debt market . 
traders said Bund vols were unlikely to suffer dramatically from current levels while the market waits for Friday &apos;s all-important U.S. non-farm payroll data .
