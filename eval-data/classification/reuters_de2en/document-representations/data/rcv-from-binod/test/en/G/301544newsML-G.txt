tens of thousands of Bulgarians rallied outside Sofia &apos;s gold-domed cathedral on Sunday as pressure grew on the ruling Socialists to call a general election two years ahead of schedule . 
the incoming and outgoing presidents said elections were the only way out of the crisis , and the speaker of parliament , Blagovest Sendov , said the ruling Socialists should agree to the opposition &apos;s demands . 
&quot; The Democratic Left should show wisdom and show that it cares for Bulgaria , and it should hold negotiations with the United Opposition under the condition of early parliamentary elections , &quot; Sendov , who backs the Socialists in parliament , told national television . 
people of all ages from the capital and provincial towns rallied outside the Alexander Nevsky cathedral on Sunday afternoon despite freezing temperatures . 
hundreds of cars flying blue opposition flags poured into the city , greeted by a Gypsy orchestra and a police escort . 
&quot; I am here because my two children have nothing to eat and my husband is unemployed , &quot; said Anzhela Georgieva , 30 . 
these are the days of a change in our history , &quot; said Blagovest Iliev , carrying his five-year-old daughter Anelia . 
under Bulgaria &apos;s post-communist constitution , the president is a largely ceremonial figure but both president-elect Petar Stoyanov and outgoing president Zhelyu Zhelev have taken firm anti-government stands in the crisis . 
Zhelev said he would not ask the Socialists , who are half way through their four-year parliamentary term , to form a government unless they agreed to elections . 
&quot; I will give a mandate for forming a government only when the political forces agree on an early parliamentary election , &quot; Zhelev told the national radio . 
Stoyanov , due to be sworn in next Sunday , said talks between the government and opposition could only be held if the government first agreed to elections . 
Socialist leader Georgi Parvanov , apparently impervious to the growing pressure , said he was happy to discuss elections but the formation of a new Socialist government was a priority . 
&quot; I have to underline that we will still receive our mandate in the next couple of days and that will allow us to start negotiations with international financial institutions by the end of the week , &quot; he said . 
voters who elected the Socialists to parliament in December 1994 delivered a powerful no-confidence vote two months ago by electing Stoyanov as president with 60 percent of the vote . 
after demonstrators besieged parliament for 10 hours on Friday and Saturday , Zhelev declined to ask the Socialists to form a new government to replace that of Zhan Videnov who resigned on December 21 . 
the opposition , backed by trade unions and groups as diverse as the national Gypsies &apos; union and the tiny rump Bulgarian Communist Party , has vowed to hold Yugoslav-style daily protests until its demand is met . 
monarchists seeking the return of exiled King Simeon also expressed their support . 
&quot; Early parliamentary elections are needed because they would be a first step towards the return of His Majesty King Simeon , &quot; Federation Kingdom Bulgaria said . 
State television took Sunday &apos;s weekly edition of the hugely popular satirical show Kanaleto off the air . 
private Darik radio said it would broadcast an audio version . 
&quot; We have been told that we are off the air because of the emergency situation , not because of the content of our show , but parliament and the presidency , not the television , should decide whether there is an emergency situation , &quot; Lyuben Dilov , one of the show &apos;s producers , told Reuters . 
masses for peace were said in Orthodox churches throughout the country after clashes on Friday and Saturday when police used clubs to break up a 10-hour siege of parliament . 
a government statement described it as &quot; minimal use of force &quot; but 196 people were injured .
