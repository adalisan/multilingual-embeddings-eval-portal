the UK &apos;s FTSE 100 index extended its early loss mid afternoon on Thursday as a renewed bout of interest rate jitters sent Wall Street sharply lower . 
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan signalled a possible rate rise at next week &apos;s policy-making session , warning that the economy retains a &quot; great deal of vigour &quot; and that a further drop in unemployment would increase the risk of higher wages and prices . 
Greenspan said the U.S. must act pre-emptively to keep inflation low .
