European oil products will once again be dominated by gasoline this week , traders say . 
recent price volatility has unnerved some people in the market , thinning liquidity . 
the outlook for gasoline looks uncertain , given recent great price volatility that some feel has been exploited and played upon by certain traders . 
problems at Exxon &apos;s Baytown cat cracker , the likelihood of renewed Nigerian gasoline imports , tight European supplies and transatlantic arbitraging of at least 150,000 tonnes within the last week have been fuelling a bullish cocktail that pushed gasoline up almost $ 15 a tonne over three days last week . 
but , more supplies are expected in Europe from August 20 onwards , reflected in a $ 15 or so backwardation in August swaps against September swaps . 
&quot; It &apos;s very unclear where we are going . 
the market is fairly thin at the moment from the end-user NWE point of view , and when prices start soaring a lot of people step back , &quot; said one trader . 
PdVSA &apos;s 45,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) Cardon reforming unit was off-line on Friday after attempts to restart it , adding an end of week bullish tinge . 
gas oil trade is likely to languish at its summer off-season low levels , beset by slack heating oil demand and ample stocks , with premiums mostly stable to weaker . 
traders in both northern Europe and the Mediterranean said that only a sharp fall in the outright price would be certain to raise volume above its recent low levels . 
&quot; The barge market will continue to be weak , &quot; said a trader in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region . 
&quot; If there is a huge fall on the flat price to $ 165 a tonne or a fall in the dollar to 1.80 marks or 1.78 marks , then there might be buying interest . 
traders said premiums were likely to remain at around flat to the screen for heating oil barges and a premium of around 50 to 75 cents for cargoes . 
low sulphur diesel cargo premiums may creep above the current September + $ 4.75 as German demand creeps in . 
in the Med , traders see little prospect of a sustained arbitrage out of the region . 
Russian 0.2 per cent heating oil is seen hovering around $ 1.50 / 2.25 over the CIF high Med quotations basis Genoa . 
a Syrian tender to buy 50,000-100,000 tonnes of 0.7 percent gas oil is due out in mid-week . 
sellers have been asked to increase their numbers . 
high sulphur fuel will remain steady , with some traders saying the dip at the end of last week was just a price cut to prompt some buying over the Assumption Day holiday and business will return to normal this week . 
but some said barges seem headed for a small correction despite good bunker demand which has pushed barge quotes to levels not seen since March , leaving cargoes about $ 10 below . 
levels of high sulphur fuel will also be a function of crude prices , which many traders said were erratic at the moment , and thus hard to pin down .
