an IMF mission arrives in Islamabad on Wednesday at a time of concerns about Pakistan &apos;s ability to service its foreign debt later this year . 
a source in the finance ministry said the International Monetary Fund team would stay until March 21 to complete a review of Pakistan &apos;s economic performance . 
if satisfied , the IMF will release the next $ 122 million tranche of a standby loan in what would be an important signal to international investors that Pakistan &apos;s new government , led by Nawaz Sharif , is keeping in step with the IMF . 
bankers say Pakistan , with liquid reserves of just over $ 1 billion , faces debt payments of some $ 600 million in March , $ 250 million in each of April and May , and $ 500 million in June . 
&quot; They have a very difficult foreign exchange situation , &quot; said one foreign banker , who asked not to be named . 
&quot; But the immediate danger of default doesn &apos;t loom that large . 
he said Pakistan could not borrow its way out of trouble indefinitely . 
&quot; How long can you go on doing this unless the trade account and the current account turn around ? 
&quot; he asked . 
Sharif , elected in a landslide victory on February 3 , has pledged to revive industry and stimulate export-led growth to get Pakistan out of its economic mess , but has yet to unveil policy details . 
some analysts have concluded that Sharif &apos;s priorities may be fatally at odds with the deficit-cutting goals of the IMF . 
a report by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia said last week default was a &quot; 90 percent probability &quot; and criticised what it perceived as the government &apos;s populist strategy . 
&quot; revitalising domestic industry and the export sector through tax cuts and monetary expansion , which will lower interest rates , may well be the preferred choice for politicians who desire popularity more than a solution to their country &apos;s ills , but it is impractical in the extreme , &quot; it said . 
&quot; Such a strategy can lead to only one course of action -- an open and defiant default on Pakistan &apos;s external debts . 
this week , a research report by brokerage house ING Barings said Pakistan may have averted an immediate foreign exchange crunch , but could fail to meet its debt payments in the second half of 1997 if it forfeited IMF support . 
the report said Pakistan faced a &quot; very high probability of default &quot; in the second half . 
it needed about $ 3 billion to meet external obligations in July-December , which it was unlikely to be able to raise without the IMF &apos;s full backing . 
ING Barings said Pakistan could meet its external payments until June . 
&quot; But we are concerned about the payments that fall due between July and December 1997 , &quot; it added . 
however , Ayesha Muzaffar , a senior analyst at James Capel Asia , said Pakistan had been staring at a possible default for the past year , but the danger was receding -- thanks in part to Sharif &apos;s appeal to Pakistanis to contribute funds in the form of donations or two-year deposits to help retire debt . 
&quot; In the short term , they will be getting money out of the debt retirement scheme and replacing short-term debt with long-term debt , &quot; she said . 
&quot; But after June , an ESAF ( enhanced structural adjustment facility ) will be very important . 
Pakistan wants to negotiate an ESAF with the IMF to gain access to cheaper funds than are available under the standby arrangement , which expires in September . 
despite doubts about whether an elected government would honour targets agreed by its predecessors , the IMF resumed the standby loan in December after a caretaker government promised to cut the budget deficit to four percent of gross domestic product in 1996 / 97 ( July-June ) from 6.3 percent in 1995 / 96 . 
the deficit target is likely to be the focus of the IMF mission &apos;s talks , given widespread reports that revenue collection has fallen seriously behind schedule .
