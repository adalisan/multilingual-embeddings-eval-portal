like most broadcasters , the first news bulletin of 1997 on Yugoslavia &apos;s state television RTS showed huge celebrations from cities like New York , London and Sydney to usher in the new year . 
but RTS ignored the one aspect of the Belgrade celebrations which made news for the international broadcasters -- a street party in central Belgrade attended by 250,000 revellers opposed to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic . 
as on most days , state-controlled RTS news ignored the opposition &apos;s long-running protest against voting fraud that robbed it of victory in local elections on November 17 . 
&quot; They ( official media ) live in cloud cuckoo land , &quot; said one opposition supporter who declined to be named . 
since the Zajedno ( Together ) coalition of opposition parties and their student allies launched daily protests 46 days ago , much of their anger has focused on RTS and the socialist daily Politika . 
on New Year &apos;s Day , 10,000 students marched passed the RTS building blowing whistles and banging pots , pans and drums to drown out the evening newscast symbolically . 
in an earlier gesture , protesters lit candles outside RTS and Politika to mourn &quot; the death of truth &quot; . 
Milosevic &apos;s stranglehold on the media has meant that people in the provinces have little idea of the chaos in the capital that is daily undermining 50 years of socialist rule . 
on December 24 , Milosevic brought thousands of people from rural towns and villages beyond the reach of Belgrade-based independent media , to join a counter-rally that resulted in running street battles between the two sides . 
&quot; What is going on ? 
&quot; asked a bewildered pensioner from the country who saw thousands of opposition supporters marching towards her . 
no one told us there might be trouble here . 
the violence left one man dead and at least 50 people injured , including one man shot in the head by a supporter of the Socialist party ( SPS ) . 
officially , half a million people joined the official &quot; Rally for Serbia &quot; in a spontaneous expression of support for the authorities . 
independent estimates put the made-for-television crowd at between 30,000 and 40,000 . 
in its reports , RTS made no mention of the violence or the 150,000 opposition supporters who marched through the city streets at the same time . 
&quot; My friend in Germany called the other day to find out how we are coping here , &quot; said a student named Jovan . 
&quot; It seems he knows more about what is going on than my parents who live in a village barely 150 kilometres ( 93 miles ) away . 
&quot; Those poor ( pro-government ) sods , &quot; said Milos Vasic of the independent weekly news magazine Vreme ( Time ) . 
&quot; They came here and got beaten up because they believed RTS . 
&quot; But the situation is now changing . 
they all would have gone back home and told their friends what realy happened here , and now I think people are starting to see through the lies . 
they are looking elsewhere for their news . 
Vasic said since the start of the crisis , support has boomed for the few independent news outlets still allowed to operate . 
Vreme &apos;s circulation has doubled to around 60,000 , while independent radio B-92 , whose signal covers only metropolitan Belgrade , has increased its regular audience from 300,000 to between 700,000 and one million . 
our sources tell us only four people with bodyguards write the daily news , and three of those listen to B-92 to hear what they can &apos;t report .
