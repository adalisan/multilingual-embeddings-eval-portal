a federal appeals court Monday struck down a Utah law that banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy , except in three limited circumstances . 
Utah legislators , in defining viability of the foetus as occurring at 20 weeks , disregarded U.S Supreme Court rulings that states may not define when a foetus becomes viable , the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals said ( corrects name of court ) . 
the federal appeals court in Denver hears cases from Utah . 
&quot; In our view , the state &apos;s determination to define viability in a manner specifically and repeatedly condemned by the ( Supreme ) Court evinces an intent to prevent a woman from exercising her right to chose an abortion after 20 weeks ... , &quot; the court said . 
the statute allowed abortion after 20 weeks only to save a woman &apos;s life , to prevent grave damage to her health or to prevent the birth of a child with grave defects . 
in 1992 a federal court struck down another provision of the Utah law that attempted to regulate abortions before 20 weeks .
