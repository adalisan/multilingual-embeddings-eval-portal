CBOT soy product futures ended weaker on Wednesday , pressured by losses in soybeans as funds switched to the sell side , traders said . 
increased farmer selling of soybeans also pressured the soy product markets with commercial selling noted early in soymeal futures . 
traders said Cargill Inc sold 200 lots December and 100 lots March while Farmers commodity Corp sold 100 lots each March and July . 
ABN-Chicago Corporation sold 400 lots May and 300 July which traders said could be cash-related . 
soybeans tumbled in late dealings on heavy fund selling , taking soy products down as well . 
technical traders said action in the soymeal pit may have triggered some of the selling in soybeans . 
&quot; March meal tested but failed to break the $ 258 mark , the contract high . 
when that happened beans broke , &quot; a trader said . 
soymeal ended $ 2.20 per ton lower to $ 0.90 higher with March off $ 2.20 at $ 253.40 . 
Soyoil closed down 0.21 to 0.07 cent per lb with March off 0.21 at 23.72 . 
new crop soymeal and soyoil escaped the late sell-off relatively unscathed . 
traders said the December contracts held up better than old crop on ideas a rally in corn was enticing farmers to plant corn instead of soybeans . 
that scenario would further trim already tight supplies . 
on the day , Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter each sold 300 lots March soymeal and prudential Securities sold 200 lots . 
in soyoil , Cargill Inc bought 400 lots March and 200 lots May and ABN-Chicago Corporation bought 300 May and 100 March . 
Rosenthal Collins sold 500 lots May and LIT sold 350 July and 100 May , traders said . 
technical traders said moving average signals were bearish for soyoil and bullish for soymeal . 
they pegged resistance Thursday at $ 256.50 per ton in March soymeal and 23.99 in March soyoil . 
soymeal volume was estimated by CBOT at 34,000 lots , against Tuesday &apos;s actual volume of 35,596 lots . 
Soyoil volume was estimated at 24,000 lots , compared with Tuesday &apos;s volume of 21,095 lots .
