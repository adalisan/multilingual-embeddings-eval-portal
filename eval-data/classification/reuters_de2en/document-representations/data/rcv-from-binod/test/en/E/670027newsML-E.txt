the World Bank said on Wednesday Indonesia &apos;s economy has performed well recently , although significant risks remained . 
&quot; domestically , core inflation is still high and key administered prices have not been increased in some time , &quot; the Bank said in its 1997 report on the Indonesian economy . 
&quot; Deregulation has lost momentum . 
the banking sector remains relatively weak ... and its exposure to the property sector is again on the rise , &quot; it said . 
looking ahead , the report said the current account deficit was likely to worsen next year , and problems in other East Asian economies could spill over into Indonesia . 
&quot; These factors risk a reversal of capital inflow , a risk that is magnified by Indonesia &apos;s large external debt and the increasing sensitivity of global output flows to changes in indicators , &quot; it said . 
the bank , however , said that the Indonesian economy was performing very well . 
&quot; Real growth continues strong , overall inflation is down , external confidence is high , foreign direct investment is robust , the external current account continues to be financeable , the current value of the rupiah has been little changed in almost a year and international reserves are up sharply , &quot; it said . 
&quot; continued sound macro policies have played an important role in achieving these results . 
a sizeable fiscal surplus was maintained and large pre-payments of high interest public external debt have continued , &quot; the report said .
