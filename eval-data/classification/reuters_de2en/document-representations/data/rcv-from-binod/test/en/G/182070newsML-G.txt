set on the river that floods past Kisangani , Joseph Conrad &apos;s classic novel &quot; Heart of Darkness &quot; evokes a pitiless jungle where death is just a breath away and all stand alone . 
for civilians and Hutu refugees fleeing Zaire &apos;s latest crisis -- a Tutsi revolt along the border with Tutsi-led Rwanda and Burundi -- it is an image likely to prove only too real . 
countless displaced Zaireans and Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees , driven west by the fighting , have disappeared into Zaire &apos;s eastern forests running southeast from Kisangani . 
one bad road leads through the tens of thousands of square kms ( miles ) of forest to the conflict zone . 
&quot; The jungle is so dense that if you walk 15 metres ( 50 feet ) you lose your way . 
imagine what is happening to the thousands of people who are lost out there , &quot; said Brother Gerard Selenke at the Catholic Mission in Kisangani . 
during daylight hours , villagers living along the road take refuge in the forest , fleeing retreating Zairean troops who feed themselves on whatever they can get from whoever they find . 
the only help for the displaced in this region that time and the outside world were starting to forget comes from the Roman Catholic Church and the local business association . 
across much of Zaire it is the same tale . 
villages subsist with little contact and no reliance on outside authority . 
&quot; The roads have not been repaired since political confusion began in 1990 , &quot; says regional governor Lombeya Bosongo , referring to Zaire &apos;s chaotic and delayed democratic transition . 
&quot; There is no money for schools , for hospitals , it is only because of what the forest can provide that we hang on at all . 
even peaceful parts of Zaire are prey to diseases like the deadly virus Ebola , which struck Kikwit in 1995 , killing 80 per cent of all those infected . 
less spectacular diseases like malaria , measles and diarrhoea quietly kill many more people . 
as a river boat pilot , Conrad plied what was then the Congo River along the navigable stretch running hundreds of kms ( miles ) between the capital Leopoldville , now Kinshasa , and Kisangani . 
the first European to cross the region , which was peopled by bellicose cannibals , was Welsh-born journalist and explorer Henry Morton Stanley in the late 19th Century . 
Stanley , famous for tracking down missing Scottish explorer and missionary David Livingstone , wrote of clashes with local people in which he personally boasted of gunning down attackers . 
nor did he shun the help of Arab slave traders to complete a journey marking the start of Zaire &apos;s grisly written history . 
founded with Stanley &apos;s help in the name of freedom by Belgian King Leopold , the artificial boundaries of the Congo became a byword for unashamed exploitation by a colonial ruler . 
Leopold was determined to extract a return on his personal investment in his colony . 
his officers terrorised the local population in areas rich in natural rubber -- hacking off the hands of those who could not meet collection targets . 
this was the world Conrad described in 1902 . 
Leopold , under international pressure , ceded the Congo to Belgium in 1908 . 
Belgium rushed through independence in 1960 . 
with virtually no preparation , the new nation lurched from one crisis to the next , plagued by corruption and mismanagement . 
Kisangani , which once bore the explorer &apos;s name as Stanleyville , is an overgrown village of 500,000 people . 
the forest greenery creeps daily closer to the centre . 
President since a military coup in 1965 , Mobutu Sese Seko rebaptised the nation Zaire in 1971 , wiping out colonial names . 
as the man who kept Zaire together through rebellions in the 1960s and 1970s , Mobutu , who is in Europe after cancer surgery , has always said that without him the country would fall apart . 
with its strongman ailing and war in the east , life in Zaire is more than ever a personal struggle for survival . 
one Zairean military officer , reflecting the mood , summed up the plight of the displaced civilians in words that might have been spoken by one of Conrad &apos;s characters : 
&quot; Why can &apos;t you just leave them to die quietly ?
