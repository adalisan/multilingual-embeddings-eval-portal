Colombia &apos;s internal coffee price remained unchanged Friday at 317,000 pesos per 125-kg load , the National Coffee Growers &apos; Federation said . 
a federation spokesman said the price was calculated on the basis of an average price of $ 2.09 in international markets over the last week . 
Colombia &apos;s internal coffee price is set weekly on a sliding scale pegged to average international prices -- a system introduced in late January to allow coffee growers benefit from price variations .
