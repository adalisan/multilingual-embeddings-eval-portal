troops regained control of a jail in southern Honduras on Thursday after 500 rioting inmates ended a stand-off that left seven people wounded , officials said . 
five prisoners and two guards were injured in an exchange of gunfire early on Thursday , but officials said the rioting inmates laid down their guns after authorities talked to them . 
&quot; The situation has been neutralised , and the prisoners gave up after we talked them out of using further violence , &quot; Lt. Norman Padilla told reporters . 
the riot broke out during a power cut late on Wednesday , when prisoners seized control of sections of the jail , located in the city of Choluteca , 70 miles ( 110 km ) south of the capital . 
during the riot , prisoners engaged in prolonged exchanges of gunfire with troops and set one of the offices on fire . 
police and army troops captured 30 prisoners who tried to escape . 
they surrounded the jail to prevent a mass breakout .
