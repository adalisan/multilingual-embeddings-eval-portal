Palestinians slapped fresh paint on Hebron storefronts on Wednesday in anticipation of self-rule , but fears of violence by Jewish settlers shone through on the volatile streets of the West Bank town . 
&quot; God willing it will be a good agreement . 
but the Palestinians have to be on guard against the settlers , &quot; said Awad Misk , a shopkeeper , after Israel and the PLO initialled a deal on an Israeli troop pullback from most of the town . 
&quot; Naturally the settlers will not leave us alone . 
it is almost certain that they will try to attack us , &quot; he said , referring to the New Year &apos;s Day wounding of seven Arabs by an off-duty Israeli soldier who shot into a Hebron market . 
some 400 Jews live or study in Hebron , home to more than 100,000 Palestinians , and will continue to hold on to their enclaves in the town guarded by Israeli soldiers . 
Jews and Arabs will continue to rub shoulders on the streets -- but keep well apart , divided by a wall and watched by Israeli soldiers and video cameras at the Tomb of the Patriarchs , which Moslems call al-Ibrahimi mosque . 
a Jewish settler massacred 29 Arab worshippers at the shrine in 1994 before he was killed by survivors . 
&quot; A sad morning , &quot; said Aharon Domb , a settler spokesman , about the Israel-PLO deal . 
there was no sign of much joy among Palestinians in Hebron , either . 
many Arab merchants and craftsmen on Hebron &apos;s main Martyrs &apos; street said they still did not know whether they would end up living in an area Israel will hand over to Palestinian police or remain under Israeli occupation . 
&quot; We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to us . 
and we don &apos;t know whether the settlers would leave us alone or not , &quot; said Abu Marwan , who sells garments on Martyrs &apos; street . 
&quot; Wouldn &apos;t it have been better for both of us Arabs and Jews had the agreement made the settlers leave us alone ? , &quot; he said . 
on the morning after the deal was sealed , Palestinians went about their business as usual in Hebron . 
so did Israeli soldiers -- for now . 
they stood guard , fingers on the triggers of assault rifles , on street corners and in front of settler enclaves scattered across the heart of the town . 
&quot; I would not believe that they have reached an agreement until I see things being implemented on the ground , &quot; said a 60- year-old retired Palestinian man who declined to give his name . 
&quot; I am afraid that the Jews have obtained what they wanted from this agreement . 
but still , I believe that the situation may improve when the Palestinian Authority takes over , &quot; he said .
