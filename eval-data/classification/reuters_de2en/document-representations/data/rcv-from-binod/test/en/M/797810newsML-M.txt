the mark was hoisted on its crosses in early Europe after the Bundesbank warned the pace of inflation has picked up and that it will steer policy to ensure price stability is maintained . 
&quot; The FX market has got very excited about the Buba report and German rates , &quot; said a senior trader at a French bank . 
in its August monthly report on Wednesday , the Bundesbank warned the pace of consumer price increases had picked up in the last few months and that it would be steering its policy to ensure inflation remained under control . 
traders said that pushed dollar / mark down and mark crosses higher . 
at 0830 GMT , mark / French franc was firm at 3.3713 / 18 and near session highs against 3.3698 / 3.3703 in late Europe on Tuesday . 
against the Swiss Franc , the mark was trading at 82.17 / 20 against 81.88 / 91 in late Europe . 
mark / lira was up at 977.30 against 976.25 / 55 . 
against the Norwegian crown , the mark was trading at 4.1155 / 85 against 4.1080 / 4.1110 . 
traders said that after the Buba report , which said the bank would observe forex movements closely and assess inflation risks , dollar / mark was hit and stops around 185.50 were triggered . 
&quot; EMS / mark selling was triggered next , &quot; said the trader at the French bank . 
the central bank said : &quot; The Bundesbank will orientate its policy in such a way that price stability , which has been essentially achieved , can be maintained . 
it said it would observe foreign exchange movements closely and assess inflation risks . 
the comments made the market focus on money rates ahead of next week &apos;s repo tender , the conditions of which have not yet been announced . 
the Buba on Tuesday set this week &apos;s repo at an unchanged 3.0 percent , signalling monetary policy on hold . 
but analysts say the bank is intent on lifting the mark against the dollar in a bid to stem inflation . 
&quot; I think the Bundesbank is in a bit of a mess ... They would really like to see the mark a bit stronger because that would impact on inflation , &quot; said Elizabeth Legge , economist at Bankgesellschaft Berlin . 
but Legge said a rate hike in the short-term is unlikely as the Buba feels the recovery in Germany is patchy . 
&quot; They would like , if they could , to talk the deutschmark up rather than make a change in their own monetary plans . 
I don &apos;t think they really , furiously , want to tighten yet , &quot; said Legge .
