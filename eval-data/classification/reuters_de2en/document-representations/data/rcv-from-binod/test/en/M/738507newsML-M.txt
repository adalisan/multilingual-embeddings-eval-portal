U.K. natural gas prices were stronger in the coming winter on Friday , traders and brokers said , and the gas year strengthened in late trade as well . 
there was active trade in all periods from prompt gas through to the end of this year , with isolated deals also reported in 1998 . 
August and September were unchanged or softer , with September trading at least five times on its own as well as once as part of a strip with August . 
the September trades were all done between 9.75 pence and 9.80 pence a therm , and it was heard offered at 9.80 pence by the close . 
this compared with offers at 9.90 pence by the close of business on Thursday . 
October was rangebound , trading between 10.90 pence and 11.00 pence , the same levels as the day before . 
but Q4 was stronger , trading at 13.15 pence , Thursday &apos;s offer price , and offered at 13.25 pence by the close . 
and the 1997 gas year saw some interesting price movements . 
it was bid at 12.85 pence for much of the day . 
but it then jumped late in the afternoon and was traded at least twice at 12.975 pence , more than 0.10 pence a therm above the bid level . 
one trader speculated that there may have been a number of gas year deals done on a p + c basis before the higher price deals were concluded . 
there were also rumours that the 1997 gas year was traded at St Fergus at 12.525 pence a therm . 
given that St Fergus capacity for the year is valued at 0.55 pence a therm , this gives an equivalent price for the gas year at the NBP of 13.075 pence a therm , and at least one seller believes that the 13.00 pence level has been breached . 
further forward there was trade in summer 1998 at 10.925 pence a therm and in Q4 98 at 13.45 , a premium of 0.30 pence over the level achieved in the fourth quarter of this year . 
the price movements seen were all minor , and dealers said they reflected no change in market fundamentals . 
the IPE traded 150 lots with most trade done in the coming winter . 
December , January and February were all done at higher prices while September slipped by 0.05 pence a therm . 
at the close front month August was bid at 9.60 pence and offered at 9.70 pence .
