German Bunds remained weak in late trade on Tuesday following a bout of profit-taking induced by a fall in U.S. treasuries amid strong U.S. industrial production and capacity utilisation data for May . 
opinions were divided on the outlook for the German market , with some dealers predicting more losses which could push September Bund futures below key resistance at 101.00 . 
others believed Bunds remained underpinned by the prospect of bullish IFO business sentiment and German May M3 money supply data expected sometime this week . 
also , the agreement on a stability pact at the European Union summit in Amsterdam had boosted market confidence by dampening fears of severe turbulence ahead of the start of European monetary union set for 1999 , some dealers said . 
at 1515 GMT , DTB September Bund futures were down 40 basis points from Monday &apos;s close at 101.71 after falling as low as 101.23 earlier in the session . 
instead , I expect the market to stabilise as the IFO numbers and the M3 data this week are likely to favour the bond market , &quot; said Markus Herrmann , a bond analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
Ouput rose 0.4 percent in May , above forecasts for an 0.2 percent rise , and the April data were revised to an increase of 0.3 percent , contrary to an originally reported flat reading . 
U.S. bond prices had already slipped earlier in the session after the release of May consumer prices which matched expectations for a rise of 0.1 percent . 
housing starts fell 4.8 percent to an annual rate of 1.397 million units while capacity utilisation in May was 83.9 percent , the highest since September 1995 .
