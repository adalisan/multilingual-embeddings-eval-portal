Israel looked headed for a spat with its closest ally after the United States said it would attend a meeting of envoys called by Yasser Arafat to discuss a crisis in Middle East peace talks . 
Israeli officials said the conference , called by the Palestinian president over the Jewish state &apos;s settlement plans and West Bank policies , was a violation of accords with the PLO . 
but U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Tuesday Washington understood &quot; the frustration of the Palestinian leadership &quot; and Arafat &apos;s initiative was natural . 
&quot; We certainly , if an invitation is formally issued to the United States , will be there , &quot; Burns told reporters . 
&quot; Chairman Arafat obviously feels the need to talk to friendly countries around the world , and that &apos;s appropriate . 
Arafat invited U.S. , European and Arab envoys to a meeting on Saturday to discuss the row brewing since Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu approved plans to build Jewish housing between Arab East Jerusalem and Bethlehem . 
the crisis deepened last Friday when Israel disclosed the depth of the first of three West Bank pullbacks , offering the Palestinians about a third of what they wanted . 
&quot; Any appeal which could bring about international involvement could -- and I am warning that such a danger exists even if Israel does not want it to come about -- bring about a freeze in the political process , &quot; Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said at a hastily convened news conference . 
levy said Arafat &apos;s move was an attempt to wring greater territorial concessions from Israel in the next two West Bank redeployments , which must be completed by mid-1998 under peace deals with the PLO . 
&quot; No one should be enticed into thinking that by doing so they will be able to pressure Israel to act against its will and interests , &quot; Levy said . 
earlier on Tuesday officials released a letter in which Jordan &apos;s King Hussein , Netanyahu &apos;s closest Arab peace parnter , accused the Israeli leader of turning Middle East peace into a &quot; distant elusive mirage &quot; with his policies . 
&quot; My distress is genuine and deep over the accumulating tragic actions which you have initiated , &quot; King Hussein told Netanyahu in a letter dated March 9 and made available to Reuters in Amman . 
&quot; I could remain aloof if the very lives of all Arabs and Israelis and their future were not fast sliding towards an abyss of bloodshed , brought about by fear and despair , &quot; the king said . 
underscoring tensions , an Israeli soldier guarding a West Bank Jewish settlement near Hebron was stabbed 20 times and seriously wounded in an apparent Palestinian guerrilla attack , military sources said on Tuesday . 
Western officials said they were concerned by the depth of distrust between Israelis and Palestinians but they echoed the assessment of Israeli security sources that the kind of violence seen in the last crisis in September was not yet on the cards . 
sixty-one Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers died in gun battles then . 
Netanyahu , on a visit to Moscow , defended his settlement plan and criticised &quot; doomsday &quot; talk . 
&quot; We have disagreements . 
we cannot at every stage of this agreement engage in cataclysmic predictions and talk of crisis and violence , &quot; Netanyahu told a news conference .
