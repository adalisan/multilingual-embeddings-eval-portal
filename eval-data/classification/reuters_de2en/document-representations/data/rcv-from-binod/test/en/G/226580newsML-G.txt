West Indies captain Courtney Walsh claimed five wickets but the tourists were frustrated by Australia &apos;s stubborn first innings resistance in reaching 322 for nine in the second test on Saturday . 
the veteran fast Bowler watched in dismay as Australia &apos;s last pair added 34 runs in an entertaining unbroken partnership before lunch on the second day at the Sydney Cricket Ground . 
Australia number 11 batsman Glenn McGrath was unbeaten on 20 at lunch alongside fellow fast Bowler Jason Gillespie on 14 . 
Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , who scored an unbeaten century in the first test , was dismissed for 44 with the second ball of the morning but his downfall failed to deflate the home side . 
West Indies , who lost the first test in Brisbane by 123 runs , were unable to tidy up the innings after Australia resumed on 224 for five . 
their frustration was heightened as McGrath advanced to his highest ever score in first-class cricket . 
he previously averaged two in test cricket . 
All-rounder Greg Blewett , who started the day on 58 , added only 11 runs before becoming Walsh &apos;s second victim of the morning session . 
Walsh removed fast Bowler Michael Kasprowicz for 21 to complete his five-wicket haul for the innings , the 12th time he has achieved the feat in test cricket . 
he finished the session with figures of five for 94 from 28 overs after removing Ricky Ponting and Mark Waugh on Friday . 
Australia added 98 runs during the session to post what will be a challenging total on a slow wicket which is regarded as being unconducive to attacking strokeplay .
