East Germany &apos;s legendary spymaster Markus Wolf , who has already escaped a conviction for Cold War treason , will go on trial next January on kidnapping charges , a German court said on Friday . 
Wolf , who headed East Germany &apos;s foreign intelligence service for more than 30 years , has been charged with organising three kidnappings between 1955 and 1962 . 
the case represents probably the last chance for prosecutors to nail Wolf , 73 , in connection with crimes committed by East Germany &apos;s leaders during four decades of communism . 
he was sentenced to six years in jail in 1993 for treason and espionage . 
but the constitutional court overturned the conviction , saying Wolf could not be convicted for spying against West Germany because he had not violated the laws of his own country at the time -- East Germany . 
the court did however allow for Wolf to be charged for offences which were also illegal in East Germany , including the kidnappings which were the stock-in-trade of agents operating at the heart of the superpower standoff in post-war Berlin . 
the three kidnapping operations could all have figured in the plot of a classic spy thriller . 
in one , Stasi agents are alleged to have lured former Stasi officer Walter Thraene and his girlfriend in 1962 to a hideout in Austria where they were beaten unconscious before being spirited to East Berlin . 
Wolf is also accused of ordering the kidnapping of Christa Trapp , a German translator at the U.S. High Commission in West Berlin , in 1955 to persuade her to work for East Berlin . 
and finally , prosecutors say Stasi agents arrested Georg Angerer , an East German typesetter , on trumped-up charges in 1959 to force him to sign defamatory statements about future chancellor Willy Brandt . 
Angerer had worked during World War Two as an interpreter for the Gestapo secret police in Norway , where Brandt also spent time during the war .
