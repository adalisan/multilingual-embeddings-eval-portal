accustomed to shock devaluations , stock market stampedes and other financial surprises , investors in Mexico are now grappling with a new phenomenon -- political risk . 
Mexico started 1997 with macroeconomic indicators all flashing green as its recovery from the December 1994 peso crash gathered pace . 
but political warning lights are blinking red . 
1997 has been hailed by opposition analysts and politicians as the &quot; year of transition &quot; -- the moment when non-government parties smash the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party &apos;s ( pri ) 67-year-old stranglehold on national power and usher in true multi-party democracy . 
the pri is deeply unpopular with electors because of dire economic crisis , soaring crime and long-running corruption scandals -- but few believe it will go without a fierce fight . 
&quot; This year is extremely important for Mexico because we &apos;re going to have very closely fought elections and the government party could lose a good part of its power , &quot; Sergio Aguayo , the president of the Civic Alliance NGO , told Reuters . 
some academics even compare what they term an historic Mexican &quot; transition &quot; to the start of black majority rule in South Africa or the collapse of the Soviet Union -- comments dismissed as ridiculous exaggerations by the government . 
pri loyalists sniffily say Mexico has always been a democracy so there is nothing to make a transition to -- though privately they bite their nails at the prospect of surrendering power . 
the opposition &apos;s excitement stems from congressional elections on July 6 when the pri could lose its majority in the lower house , the Chamber of Deputies , for the first time since the party was founded in the tumultuous aftermath of the 1910-17 Mexican Revolution . 
the implications are huge in a country where Congress has historically acted as a docile rubber stamp for an all-powerful pri president . 
&quot; The next elections ... seriously threaten to end a grotesque daily phenomenon which has been the foundation stone of Mexican presidentialism , namely the famous pri steamroller in Congress &quot; , wrote political analyst Benito Nacif in a recent article . 
analysts say the uncertainty about the election result -- as well as post-electoral jockeying for position if the pri loses its majority -- could buffet financial markets . 
&quot; The high degree of uncertainty will make people nervous and they may protect themselves by taking cover and moving investments out of pesos , &quot; leading economic commentator Enrique Quintana told Reuters . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t rule out sharp movements in the exchange rate of up to five or six percent . 
raising the stakes further , the July election will also decide who will be the first elected mayor of Mexico City since the 1920s and who will govern six states . 
these include the key northern territories of Nuevo Leon ( which includes the industrial capital of Monterrey ) , and Sonora , geographically and politically a heavyweight state . 
only a quarter of the Senate is up for renewal and the pri &apos;s large majority means it is mathematically impossible for the ruling party to lose control of that chamber . 
it retains strong support in the countryside , counts on an impressive national election-winning machine and will enjoy the benefit of more than $ 140 million in government funding -- a novelty voted through Congress in the teeth of fierce opposition criticism last year . 
some analysts believe it could remain the biggest single party in the lower house , even if it loses its overall majority . 
with so much to play for , it is not surprising that the political temperature is rising fast . 
President Ernesto Zedillo , a dry technocrat more at home at international investor meetings than on the campaign hustings , has unveiled what commentators term an aggressive new style for 1997 . 
recent Zedillo speeches have lashed out at the foreign press , at Mexicans who entertain correspondents in their homes to say negative things about the government , and at the opposition who fail to recognise his achievements . 
presidential officials deny a tougher line -- and Zedillo himself has said that &quot; the only hardening which my government accepts is against intolerance , against injustice , against corruption , against poverty &quot; . 
but analysts say the change of tone has been notable in a country where political sparring is generally conducted with heavily coded phrases and using terms so obtuse that only the protagonists understand them . 
&quot; There is a radical change in the sense that the president is entering the fray directly , &quot; noted Rafael Segovia , a politics professor at the Colegio de Mexico . 
underlining the pri &apos;s combative new mood , Zedillo suddenly switched the president of the pri last month , replacing backroom negotiator Santiago Onate with the fiercely combative Humberto Roque Villanueva . 
formerly the pri floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies , Roque is best known for celebrating victory over the opposition in a key vote by making an uncouth gesture to send his political enemies the message : &quot; We screwed You &quot; . 
in comments last week that thrilled the pri faithful but sent shivers down the spines of opposition leaders hoping for a civilised campaign , Roque lashed out in all directions . 
he berated left-wingers for being closet dictators , branded the main opposition right-wing National Action Party ( PAN ) as potential fascists and compared one of the leading PAN lights , Guanajuato Governor Vicente Fox , with Mussolini . 
ironically in view of the fierce fight , analysts say most of the turmoil in financial markets is likely to be pre- rather than post-election . 
the PAN -- tipped by many as the likely biggest force in the lower house after the elections -- has very similar free-market economic policies to the pri . 
anxious to show the PAN will not rock the boat excessively -- which might damage their chances of winning the next presidential election in 2000 -- party leaders have already put out feelers to the government about agreeing a &quot; pact of governability &quot; in advance of the July vote . 
Roque dismissed the idea , saying that such a deal would amount to an admission of defeat by the pri before it had even fought the election . 
but most commentators believe that the long-ruling pri will have little alternative but to negotiate with the opposition if it loses its lower house majority . 
&quot; The model they have is very similar to that of the French co-habitation between ( former socialist president Francois ) Mitterrand and the right . 
he concluded : &quot; 1997 is very important but it &apos;s not the decisive year ... for me that is 2000 , without a doubt &quot; .
