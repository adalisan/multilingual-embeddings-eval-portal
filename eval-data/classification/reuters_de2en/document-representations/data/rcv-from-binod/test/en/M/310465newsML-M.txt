Indonesian and Malaysian buyers could take delivery of up to 300,000 tonnes of corn over the next two months , regional traders said on Wednesday . 
Indonesian buyers were expected to take delivery of between 180,000 and 200,000 tonnes of corn , mostly from the United States , through January and early February , the traders added . 
the consignments were mostly imported at $ 180- $ 185 a tonne C &amp; F and were expected to be used by the importing feedmills and not traded as the sale price would be above the market range . 
&quot; My estimate is that the lowest price the importers can offer would be 475 rupiah a kg , which is 100 rupiah above the market price , &quot; one trader said . 
another trader in the key Indonesian growing region of Lampung said the harvest was progressing , but he expected the peak to come in either late January of early February . 
&quot; arrivals are steadily increasing , and I am now getting about 150 to 200 tonnes per day , &quot; she said . 
another trader said the effects of recent gains in Chicago soybean futures prices following surprisingly bullish USDA crop production data last Friday would take about two to three weeks to trickle down to the Indonesian market . 
he said local soymeal prices had been steady , and that some buyers were looking for prompt delivery shipments . 
&quot; If ( local ) buyers are looking for soymeal , they will most likely be sourcing it from India . 
he said imports from South Africa would only arrive at end-May at the earliest for orders made now . 
in Malaysia , traders said local importers could be in the market for one or two shipments -- meaning 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes -- of corn for February / March if they can buy below $ 150 a tonne C &amp; F. 
&quot; The market &apos;s always looking out for signs when the international price may go higher , and the signs are coming now , &quot; said the sales manager of a flour mill in Kuala Lumpur . 
&quot; Probably by the next or following week , some people might jump in to buy , &quot; he added . 
a trading source close to Federal flour Mills Bhd said the company would be &quot; very interested &quot; in securing a couple of corn shipments for between $ 140 and $ 150 a tonne . 
traders said there was ample supply of corn and other grains in Malaysia and no major imports were noted last week . 
shipments of long-awaited Chinese corn could also spark some buying if they begin to land in the local market next week , the traders added . 
they added that the surge in the ringgit against the U.S. dollar in the last week has not had any impact on the grains and oilseeds market , but some negative effects could be felt if the currency trend continues into February . 
bulk corn , ex-factory / godown in Malaysia &apos;s central region , was quoted unchanged at 415 ringgit ( $ 167 ) a tonne this week . 
&quot; A &quot; grade wheat in bags , ex-factory / godown in the central region , was also stable at 800 ringgit a tonne and low grade wheat continued to be indicated at 450 ringgit a tonne on the same basis . 
local soymeal was unchanged at 820 ringgit a tonne , while imported material was put at 830 , both in the central region . 
in Thailand , soymeal and corn prices were mostly steady to lower this week while importers were sidelined by higher world prices of both commodities and uncertainties over government corn import policy , trade sources said . 
soymeal was quoted around 9.30 baht a kg ( US $ 0.37 ) from 9.30-9.40 baht a week ago . 
prices eased slightly as the market realised adequate supplies were available in January . 
&quot; I heard there were lots of inquiries but no actual buying . 
I guess buyers will wait until prices fall before entering the market again , &quot; one Singapore-based trader said . 
about 50,000 tonnes of soymeal , 90,000 tonnes of soybeans and 1,200 tonnes of other feed raw materials were scheduled to be discharged in Thailand this month . 
local corn prices were mostly steady at 4.20-4.30 baht a kg , barely changed from last week . 
traders said buyers are reluctant to import corn now as they await a clear-cut government position on the zero-tariff corn import schedule . 
the cabinet on Tuesday decided to delay the schedule of such corn imports set earlier from February 20 - June 30 . 
the move was aimed at encouraging local animal feed producers to use more domestic supplies and so support local prices . 
however , the change will not affect importers in the frozen poultry export business who will receive a full refund on feed raw material tariffs under an export promotion scheme . 
&quot; I &apos;ve not heard of any buying order during the past week . 
it &apos;s not only because of the uncertainties on policy , but also prices which are not very attractive , &quot; one Bangkok trader said .
