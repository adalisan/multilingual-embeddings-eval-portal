Canadian manufacturers remained positive about production and employment prospects for the coming three months , Statistics Canada said on Friday . 
if anything , they were slightly concerned about low finished product inventories . 
overall , manufacturers were quite satisfied with the current level of orders received , with a large proportion indicating that unfilled order levels were normal , it added . 
the quarterly survey , taken in July , showed 93 percent of manufacturers reported that their current level of orders received was either about the same or increasing when compared with the previous three months . 
almost one in three reported that orders received were rising , while seven percent reported declining orders . 
nonetheless , the balance of opinion was down four points at plus 23 -- calculated by subtracting the seven percent decline from the 30 percent rise . 
the balance of opinion on finished product inventories took an unprecedented turn above the zero mark , at plus four . 
a positive balance indicates that overall more manufacturers are concerned about inventory levels being too low rather than too high . 
statistics Canada suggested that this was likely an indication of strong orders rather than a shortage of inventories . 
a record 19 percent said their inventories were too low , seven points higher than April and 15 points higher than a year earlier . 
their opinion for production prospects increased four points to plus 10 , with 25 percent planning to increase output in the next three months and 15 percent planning to cut output . 
such optimisim , it said , was expected because of the new orders and low inventories . 
disregarding the large swing in January , caused by the end of Labor unrest , the current balance is the most positive since early 1995 , it added . 
eighty percent felt their unfilled orders were normal , 10 percent said higher than normal and 10 percent said lower -- giving a balance of zero , an improvement over the minus seven in April . 
most employers ( 76 percent ) said there would be little change in their employment level , but 15 percent said they would add jobs . 
the balance of opinion rose one point to plus six . 
a shortage of skilled Labor continued to impede production for five percent of manufacturers , mostly due to shortages in Ontario and Alberta , the federal agency reported .
