alcoholics seeking help do not have to be precisely &quot; matched &quot; to the best therapy but can get good results from a variety of competent treatment programmes , researchers said on Tuesday . 
a large eight-year study was designed to test the popular theory that extensive screening and evaluation could &quot; match &quot; an alcoholic to the best treatment approach . 
&quot; In general this did not pan out , &quot; Dr. Enoch Gordis , director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and alcoholism ( NIAAA ) told a news conference . 
about 9 percent of U.S. adults are alcoholics or alcohol abusers . 
alcohol kills 100,000 people in the United States each year , costs $ 100 billion , and wreaks havoc on the lives of drinkers and their families . 
this study looked at three types of 12-week individual therapies . 
it did not evaluate group therapy and did not factor in whether patients also attended alcoholics Anonymous . 
more than 1,700 patients in the eight-year study were screened for several traits , among them how severe their drinking problem was , how motivated they were to change , and whether they had other psychological problems . 
they were then matched with one of three behavioural therapies -- a 12-step programme that shares some of AA &apos;s principles and prepares them for AA , a cognitive-behavioural approach in which they worked on developing skills to avoid relapse ; or a motivational enhancement therapy designed to help them build up their own ability to stay sober . 
in addition some patients had only outpatient care while others entered these therapies as &quot; aftercare &quot; following inpatient treatment . 
with minor exceptions , the study found no differences except that outpatients without other psychological problems did somewhat better in the 12-step approach . 
overall , all the participants showed significant and sustained improvement . 
typically they reduced their drinking from 25 or 30 days a month , to six days , and they consumed less in each alcohol episode , the researchers found . 
the researchers said their findings did not rule out matching for other psychiatric problems . 
but for alcoholism , the stress now should be on getting drinkers to competent therapists , continuing research into the brain chemistry of alcoholism and working on new drugs and treatments , they said .
