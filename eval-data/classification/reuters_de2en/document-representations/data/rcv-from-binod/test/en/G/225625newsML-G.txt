a human rights lawyer on Friday criticised Israel &apos;s High Court for accepting secret police interrogation methods that include using force on Arab detainees . 
at Friday &apos;s hearing , the state denied the detainee was being shaken in interrogation , a method independent pathologists have said caused the death of at least one Palestinian prisoner in the past . 
but the state did not deny secret police used physical pressure on the Arab East Jerusalem man -- including sleep deprivation and covering his head with a sack . 
the court ruled in two other cases this month that &quot; physical pressure &quot; could be used on Palestinian suspects to extract information police said could prevent suicide attacks . 
&quot; When they take a man and isolate him completely and use means that in essence the High Court by its silence approves -- for instance holding a man without sleep , holding him bound for long hours in known painful positions , playing loud disco music , &quot; lawyer Lea Tsemel told Israel Radio . 
Tsemel made her comment after Israel &apos;s High Court postponed until next week a hearing on her client &apos;s demand that he be allowed to meet with her . 
the suspected Islamic Jihad activist has been under interrogation for nine days . 
she said the law allowed the Shin Bet to prevent detainees held in Israel on &quot; security suspicions &quot; from seeing their lawyers for up to 30 days , with that period extendable . 
Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups have long said a 1987 Israeli state commission &apos;s ruling that the Shin Bet could use &quot; moderate physical pressure &quot; in interrogations and &quot; increased physical pressure &quot; when an attack was imminent sanctioned torture . 
Israel has been on alert against Islamic Jihad suicide attacks since late October . 
it feared the group would attempt to mark the year anniversary of its leader Fathi Shqaqi &apos;s assassination with a bombing . 
Shqaqi was gunned down in Malta . 
his assassins escaped . 
Islamic Jihad , whose militants have committed suicide bombings in Israel in recent years , blamed Israel for the killing .
