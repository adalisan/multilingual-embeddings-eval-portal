Kim Myung-kwan of Daewoo Securities said the government is expected to announce measures to boost the stock market soon . 
market sentiment improved following President Kim Young-sam &apos;s New Year news conference on Tuesday , when Kim said a committee on financial reform would be established and priority put on lowering interest rates .
