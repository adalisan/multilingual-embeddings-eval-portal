President Fernando Henrique Cardoso &apos;s plan to become Brazil &apos;s first re-elected leader in elections in 1998 got a big boost on Tuesday when the lower house of Congress approved a bill allowing him to run again . 
a constitutional amendment , which lets sitting presidents , state governors and mayors stand for a second consecutive term , was approved by 336 deputies in Congress &apos; first full vote on the bill -- 28 more than the three-fifths majority needed . 
presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral said Cardoso saw the vote as &quot; a decision to carry on the policy of economic stability and a desire to continue along the path of transforming Brazilian society . 
in a statement , the president urged Congress to fully approve the bill and said he was eager to press ahead with unfinished reforms to streamline the Brazilian state . 
Brazil has banned re-election since the founding of the republic in 1889 to prevent a repeat of the supreme powers of its Portuguese imperialist rulers . 
but Cardoso says he wants to win the 1998 presidential race to give political continuity to the economic reforms he launched as finance minister in 1994 . 
&quot; This was a historic decision , &quot; said Political Affairs Minister Luis Carlos Santos , who temporarily resigned from his cabinet post to vote . 
&quot; We &apos;re burying the old ways and putting Brazil in step with the civilised world where things work . 
the re-election bill must be approved once more by the Chamber of Deputies and then twice in the Senate , requiring a three-fifths majority on each occasion . 
but Tuesday &apos;s vote was considered its biggest hurdle . 
a rebellion within the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party , Congress &apos; biggest party which normally votes with Cardoso , forced the government to fly in sick deputies for the session . 
&quot; The worst has now past , &quot; political analyst Ricardo Pedreira said as Cardoso supporters in the lower house hugged one another and cheered the result . 
Argentine President Carlos Menem , who like Peru &apos;s Alberto Fujimori rewrote his country &apos;s constitution to win re-election , congratulated Cardoso in a telephone call minutes after the vote , a deputy who met with the president told reporters . 
analysts say the prospect of four more years in addition to the two left in his current term would bolster Cardoso &apos;s volatile support in Congress . 
he would then find it easier to push through his reforms of the civil service , tax and pensions , considered vital to the long-term success of his economic plan . 
Brazil &apos;s left-wing opposition , which joined rebel allies in abstaining from the vote , said the bill would make Cardoso hard to beat in 1998 and urged deputies to approve a clause forcing office holders to stand down six months before an election . 
&quot; The form of re-election that has been approved will do away with any equality between political parties fighting for power , &quot; said Jose Dirceu , president of the socialist Workers Party . 
&quot; Look at the past . 
these measures lead to authoritarianism . 
the Chamber of Deputies was due to begin voting on that proposal and other changes to the bill on Wednesday morning . 
government whips said they would seek to defeat all the changes .
