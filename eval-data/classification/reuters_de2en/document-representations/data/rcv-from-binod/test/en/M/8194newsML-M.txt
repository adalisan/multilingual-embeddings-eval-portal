the Bank of Canada cut its key Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent on Thursday by conducting special purchase and resale operations at 4.25 percent . 
the move effectively lowered its target range for the overnight lending rate to 3.75-4.25 percent from 4.0-4.5 percent , money market traders said . 
the Bank Rate is the top of the central bank &apos;s target range for the overnight rate , at which it lends to financial institutions in its role as lender of last resort . 
the move by the Bank of Canada follows a decision by Germany &apos;s Bundesbank to cut short-term interest rates . 
the Bundesbank &apos;s move triggered rate cuts in other European countries . 
the move also followed a report from Statistics Canada that Canadian retail sales rose 0.6 percent in June but that early indications for July retail sales pointed to a drop . 
many analysts had expected the Bank of Canada to lower interest rates in a bid to boost a sluggish economy . 
the Canadian money market rallied this week and this morning to fully price in the impact of a rate cut . 
it was the seventh easing by the Bank of Canada this year and the sixth done independent of the U.S. Federal Reserve . 
the Bank has eased 16 times since May 8 , 1995 by a total of 400 basis points . 
major chartered banks quickly followed the central bank easing by lowering their prime rates to 5.75 percent from 6.0 percent . 
the bank rate is now at its lowest level since March 22 , 1994 . 
the bank rate fell as low as 3.87 percent in February , 1994 . 
Prime rates are now at their lowest level since March 27 , 1994 when they were 5.5 percent .
