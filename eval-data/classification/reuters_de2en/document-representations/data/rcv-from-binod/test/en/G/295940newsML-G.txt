a Brazilian handyman who has cheated death twice in the past returned home this week to find he had missed his own funeral by two hours . 
Lourival Souza de Santos , 33 , who has previously survived a smashed skull and multiple bullet wounds , was declared dead on Tuesday . 
a police spokesman in the Itapua suburb of the northeastern city of Salvador said Santos &apos; brother mistakenly identified him as a murder victim , whose face had been mutilated by gunshots . 
&quot; The irony is that Lourival has survived a crushed skull in a fight and eight bullet wounds from a murder attempt , &quot; he told Reuters by telephone . 
&quot; It &apos;s only when nothing at all had happened to him that he was finally declared dead . 
&quot; It &apos;s like I have three lives , at least , &quot; Santos told national Globo television . 
news agency Agencia Estado quoted Santos &apos; mother as saying she thought the corpse the family buried on Tuesday was &quot; slightly large .
