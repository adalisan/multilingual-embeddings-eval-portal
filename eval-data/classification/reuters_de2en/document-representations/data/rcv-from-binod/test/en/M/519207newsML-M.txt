Taiwan share prices remained virtually unchanged at mid-session on Thursday amid what brokers called a lack of market-inspiring factors . 
with 90 minutes left , the weighted index was up a minuscule 0.31 points -- less than one-hundredth of a percent -- at 8,615.09 . 
turnover was heavy at T $ 75.83 billion , but less active than the torrential volumes registered in recent sessions . 
the market had opened lower on the government &apos;s announcement Wednesday that it would speed up its selldown of equity in the &quot; Big Three &quot; state-run commercial banks . 
the Big Three -- First Bank , Hua Nan and Chang Hwa -- remained virtually unchanged after having fallen by over 10 percent each since their ex-rights date on April 10 . 
&quot; They have already fallen a lot , so there is not much room for further drops , &quot; said Oliver Fang , an analyst for National Securities . 
brokers said the overall index likely would stay in a gradual downtrend due to the government &apos;s apparent reluctance to support the market at this time .
