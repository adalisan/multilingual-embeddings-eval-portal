three explosive devices blasted throngs of Christmas Eve shoppers in a small South African town on Tuesday , killing two children and an adult and wounding up to 80 others , police and hospital officials said . 
a police spokesman said two hand grenades were believed to have gone off at a chemist shop in the farm town of Worcester , 90 km ( 55 miles ) northeast of Cape Town , while a third unidentified device exploded at a crowded supermarket . 
&quot; It looks as if up to 80 people could have been injured , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We are looking for a red Jetta ( Volkswagen ) with a Cape Town registration ... Nobody has claimed responsibility yet . 
police said they were looking for three people seen fleeing the area and offered a reward of half-a-million rand ( $ 107,000 ) for information . 
hospital staff said two of the dead were children , one six years old , who died in hospital of their injuries . 
an adult was killed instantly by one of the blasts , they said . 
the superintendent of Worcester hospital had earlier said in a radio interview many children were among the casualties . 
&quot; One child has died , two children have serious head and eye injuries . 
there are two critically ill children with abdominal trauma ... the rest seem to be under control , mostly with shrapnel wounds , &quot; she said . 
about 30 people had already been discharged after treatment but many had been flown to better-equipped hospitals in Cape Town . 
a doctor at the Worcester hospital said he had heard one of the explosions , which sounded like a cannon going off . 
&quot; The bombs have caused a huge commotion here . 
no one can understand why anyone would want to plant bombs here . 
Worcester is a small town surrounded by picturesque mountains in a fruit-growing district . 
the owner of the chemist shop said he had been standing about five metres from one of the blasts . 
&quot; It was chaos . 
it was like a massive firecracker , everyone started screaming , running around . 
all the windows are finished . 
the last major bombing in South Africa was carried out on the eve of historic all-race elections in April 1994 . 
right-wing whites planted several car bombs , killing 20 people , in a bid to disrupt the poll . 
President Nelson Mandela &apos;s African National Congress condemned the blasts . 
&quot; This can only be the work of enemies of peace and goodwill among our people and the country at large , &quot; an ANC statement said . 
&quot; We call on all our comumunities to ensure that the perpetrators have nowhere to hide among the people .
