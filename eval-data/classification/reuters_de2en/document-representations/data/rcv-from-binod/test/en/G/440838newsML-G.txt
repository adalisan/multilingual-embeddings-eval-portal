NASA unveiled on Wednesday the Lunar Prospector , a low-cost , unmanned spacecraft due for launch in September scientists hope will settle the question of whether there is water on the moon . 
lunar Prospector will mark the National Aeronautics and Space Administration &apos;s ( NASA ) first mission to the moon since the six Apollo landings between 1969 and 1972 . 
the simple spacecraft , 4-1 / 2 feet ( 1.35 metres ) high and weighing 660 lbs ( 300 kgs ) when fully fuelled , was shown to reporters at the Sunnyvale facility of Lockheed Martin Corp , which built it . 
the mission is part of NASA &apos;s discovery programme , which stresses lower-cost , more frequent scientific missions . 
NASA officials are proud that the total cost of the Lunar Prospector mission , including launch , mission operations and data analysis , is $ 63 million , a fraction of the price of some of its previous projects . 
lunar Prospector will circle the moon in a polar orbit for a year , mapping the entire surface of the moon from an altitude of 60 miles ( 100 kms ) . 
although astronauts have walked on its surface , NASA officials say there is much we do not know about Earth &apos;s nearest planetary neighbour . 
&quot; Many people are under the impression that we &apos;ve been there and we &apos;ve done that . 
that &apos;s not true . 
more than 75 percent of the moon &apos;s structure and composition has never been mapped , &quot; said Scott Hubbard , Lunar Prospector mission manager at NASA &apos;s Ames Research Centre in Mountain View , California . 
interest in the Lunar Prospector is high because of the revelation in December that the moon , previously thought to be bone-dry , may contain water . 
scientists who analysed radar signals from clementine , a U.S. Defence Department spacecraft that orbited the moon in 1994 , said they suggested the presence of water ice in a deep basin near the lunar south pole . 
ice crystals may be mixed with dirt there , they said . 
lunar Prospector should confirm whether or not there are water ice deposits in the polar regions of the moon , NASA says . 
the spacecraft carries a neutron spectrometer which detects hydrogen that scientists said would almost certainly be in the form of water . 
&quot; Lunar Prospector will tell us for sure . 
if there &apos;s a cup of water in a cubic yard of moon dirt , we &apos;ll find it and then we &apos;ll really know , &quot; Hubbard told a news conference . 
if there is water on the moon , some scientists have suggested , it could pave the way not only for a human colony there but could also be separated into hydrogen and oxygen and used as rocket fuel , enabling the moon to serve as a staging post for missions to distant planets . 
&quot; If there &apos;s water , I think the impetus to go back to the moon with man will be very great , &quot; Alan binder , principal investigator for the Lunar Prospector project at Lockheed Martin , said . 
any water found on the moon would have come from comets striking its surface because the moon itself does not have water , binder said .
