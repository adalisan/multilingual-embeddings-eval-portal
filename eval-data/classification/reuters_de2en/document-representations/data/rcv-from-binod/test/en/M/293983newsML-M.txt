Ara bunker prices were steady , while prices in the rest of Europe firmed and buying all over the continent improved , dealers said . 
Rotterdam 380 CST still traded in a range of $ 119 / $ 121 fob , despite an afternoon slump in the barge market . 
dealers said demand throughout the Ara region was healthy , but supplying Amsterdam and Flushing remained a problem . 
barge operators insisted on an ice surcharge of about $ 1.50 a tonne in addition to the normal freight levy . 
&quot; There &apos;s definitely a problem getting into some ports and it can cost a lot of money , &quot; one dealer said . 
Hamburg bunkers , as in Rotterdam , were steady , but business there was slow . 
Mediterranean bunkers mostly firmed by $ 1- $ 2 a tonne . 
bunkers in Gibraltar and the Canary Islands , up a dollar , were particularly in demand . 
good demand in Fujairah also allowed prices to increase , by $ 1 a tonne . 
Saudi Aramco lifted diesel bunkers by $ 3 a tonne , but kept fuel oil bunkers unchanged .
