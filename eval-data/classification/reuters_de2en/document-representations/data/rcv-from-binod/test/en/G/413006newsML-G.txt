a military-dominated council has told Turkey &apos;s Islamist-led government not to stray from the path of democracy and official secularism after weeks of tension between the secularist generals and the ruling coalition . 
&quot; concessions must never be given on the applications of the republic &apos;s laws and constitution that guarantee the democratic system , &quot; the influential National Security Council ( NSC ) said in a statement read on the state-run TRT television station . 
the council , attended by Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan , met for nine hours until midnight on Friday ( 2200 GMT ) . 
its pronouncements traditionally reflect the will of the army . 
&quot; The meeting decided to inform the cabinet of measures that need to be taken in respect to these issues , &quot; the statement said . 
it did not elaborate on the measures . 
strains have escalated since the army sent tanks on manoeuvres through Ankara &apos;s Sincan district early in February after an Islamist protest there attended by the Iranian ambassador . 
rumours of a possible coup against Erbakan &apos;s coalition have been rife but Western diplomats say the generals are reluctant to intervene , partly because Turkey &apos;s image abroad would suffer . 
&quot; All kinds of speculation that could harm Turkey &apos;s image and respect abroad and create doubts about its democracy ... must be ended , &quot; the statement said . 
Hasan Ekinci , an official of the junior coalition partner True Path Party ( DYP ) , said before the council meeting that it would reduce political tension . 
&quot; ( Erbakan &apos;s Welfare Party ) RP cannot behave like an opposition party ... The task of governments is not to raise tension and stress . 
God willing , the RP leadership will be more careful after this , &quot; Ekinci told reporters . 
Turkish media have carried reports -- dismissed as untrue by Erbakan and the president &apos;s office -- that President Suleyman Demirel warned the coalition in a letter against threatening Turkey &apos;s &quot; secularist , democratic ( and ) republican aims &quot; . 
the reports , echoing Demirel &apos;s recent briefings to newspaper editors , aggravated political tension over the rising profile of Islamists in the Moslem but secular state . 
&quot; The fear that the rising tension of recent days will lead to the burning of bridges , however unlikely , has been enough to make everybody &apos;s hair stand on end in Ankara , &quot; wrote Bilal Cetin , columnist for the liberal daily Yeni Yuzyil . 
Erbakan spoke on state television on Friday night about his eight-month-old coalition with pro-Western leader Tansu Ciller . 
&quot; Our government is working in a spirit of worship for the happiness of the people , &quot; Erbakan said , in an address trumpeting the government &apos;s economic achievements . 
the start of the address coincided with the last of a month of nightly civilian protests , launched initially against state corruption , which have increasingly turned against Erbakan and his party . 
the government this week survived a censure motion challenge from two leftist parties which said the coalition was a threat to Turkey &apos;s secularism . 
next week it will face another censure motion debate in parliament proposed by the opposition . 
the military &apos;s displeasure at Erbakan &apos;s efforts to push ahead with Islam-based policies is not expected to result in anything like the three army interventions seen in Turkey since 1960 , analysts said . 
financial markets were steady and quiet awaiting the outcome of the meeting . 
the Istanbul share index closed up 0.81 percent . 
the army is upset at comments in favour of sharia , or Islamic law , made by Islamists and by the Iranian ambassador at the anti-Israel protest in Sincan . 
relations between Ankara and Tehran have been soured over the Iranian ambassador &apos;s involvement in the Sincan rally , which led to him being recalled to Iran .
