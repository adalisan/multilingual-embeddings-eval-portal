the Singapore bunker market was softer on Wednesday amid weak crude values and poor demand , traders said . 
the 380-cst grade was quoted at $ 94 / $ 97 per tonne , about $ 1- $ 2 per tonne lower than a day before , and the 180-cst grade was at $ 100 / $ 103 . 
&quot; Today I only got enquiries from old customers , &quot; said one supplier , adding that many shipowners were asking for too low prices .
