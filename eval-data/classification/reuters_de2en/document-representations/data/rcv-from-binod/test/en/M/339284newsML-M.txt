Tokyo naphtha prices were slightly softer on Tuesday , tracking overnight losses in the crude oil market , traders said . 
Open-spec naphtha second-half March was assessed at $ 229.00 / 230.50 a tonne and first-half April at $ 228.00 / 229.50 , down from Monday &apos;s $ 229.50 / 231.00 and $ 228.50 / 230.50 . 
Inter-month spreads were barely changed with first-half April / first-half May assessed at $ 2.50 / 3.50 . 
traders expected the spreads to firm after recent weakness . 
on Monday , second-half March traded at $ 230.50 and first-half March at $ 231.50 , traders said . 
in the wet market , South Korean and Japanese end-users were quietly probing market levels for first-half March cargoes , traders said . 
buyers are not expected to rush into the market , however , because short-term supplies are ample , they said . 
they added that the kerosene market was dull due to a dearth of buyers , with domestic stockpiles building due to poor sales . 
for March , traders expected that Japan would need more than three cargoes of kerosene . 
Japan &apos;s kerosene stocks as of end-December were up 33.2 percent year-on-year at 4.1 million kilolitres , according to the trade ministry .
