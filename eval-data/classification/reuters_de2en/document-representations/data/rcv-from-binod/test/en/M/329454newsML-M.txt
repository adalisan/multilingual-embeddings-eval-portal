Jakarta call money fell to 7.5 / 8.0 percent from 9.0 / 10.0 on Thursday following excess rupiah supply , but bond prices were stable , dealers said . 
they said an early central bank injection of some 536 billion rupiah and fresh government transfers of civil servants &apos; 13th month salaries seemed to have flooded the market . 
the transfers come ahead of the EID al-Fitr celebration on February 9 and 10 . 
dealers said initial declines in short-term swaps seemed to have also driven money market rates down . 
overnight swap was at 0.05 / 0.10 and three-day Tom / next swaps at 0.7 / 0.8 points . 
longer-term rates were easier , with one- and three-month money quoted at 12.50 / 12.75 and 13.25 / 13.50 respectively . 
the central bank kept bilateral rates for short-term papers ( SBIs ) stable after cutting 25 basis points late on Wednesday for papers longer than one-month . 
the bank offered overnight SBIs at seven percent , 4-5 day at eight percent , 6-8 day at nine percent , 11-15 day at 10.0 percent , 18-22 day at 10.5 percent , one-month at 11.5 percent , three- , six- and 12-month at 12.25 , 12.50 and 12.75 percent . 
the average overnight interbank rate on Wednesday was 10.7 percent , compared with 13.22 percent on Tuesday . 
bond dealers said prices were relatively stable on Thursday morning after rising steadily the past few days which caused the average yield to decline . 
they said the market was waiting for the allocation results of Astra International &apos;s 400 billion rupiah straight bonds at 15.5 percent , whose subscription period ended on Wednesday . 
one dealer said , however , its grey market price was said to be traded at around 100.5 percent , suggesting a yield of about 15.35 percent . 
another issue which was about to be launched was the 250 billion rupiah seven-year straight bonds of toll road operator PT Citra Marga Nusaphala Persada ( CMNP ) . 
dealers said the coupon was rumoured to be around 16.25 percent .
