Lebanon &apos;s Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri walked out of parliament on Thursday after it voted to curb government borrowing by obliging him to seek authorisation for each loan the government wants to raise . 
the resolution said the cash-strapped government must comply with the law and constitution in treasury borrowing . 
it was approved by parliament after a sharp exchange between Speaker Nabih Berri and Hariri , whose government has accumulated a growing mountain of debt to help finance its national reconstruction programme . 
according to parliamentary sources , the government is constitutionally obliged to obtain parliamentary approval for all borrowing . 
the 1997 budget law approved in January authorised government borrowing to cover a planned 36 percent annual deficit of income against expenditure but the deficit has ballooned out of control and was 60 percent at the end of April . 
a parliamentary deputy told Reuters the house was concerned that the government was borrowing over the 36 percent deficit ceiling without seeking its approval . 
&quot; We want you to pledge that there will be no treasury borrowing without going back to parliament in compliance with the law and constitution , &quot; Berri told Hariri during a heated question-and-answer session . 
&quot; We comply with laws and constitution , &quot; Hariri replied . 
&quot; This was in the past . 
what about the future ? 
&quot; Berri answered . 
&quot; We comply , &quot; Hariri said . 
at that point Selim al-Hoss , a former prime minister now in opposition , proposed a vote on the resolution , which stated that : &quot; The government pledges to comply with the law and constitution in treasury borrowing matters &quot; . 
when the house voted by a show of hands in favour of the resolution Hariri walked out saying : &quot; I withdrew from the session &quot; . 
Reporters at the session said Berri did not count the votes before declaring the resolution passed . 
when a deputy protested that a majority had voted against , he overruled him . 
Lebanon &apos;s total domestic and foreign debt rose in the first four months of the year by nearly $ 1 billion to $ 11.6 billion . 
this compares with an estimated GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) of $ 13.9 billion at the end of 1996 .
