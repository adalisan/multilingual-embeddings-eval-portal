Matthew Harding , multi-millionaire vice-chairman of Prime Minister John Major &apos;s favourite football team Chelsea , was killed in a helicopter crash on Tuesday night , the club said on Wednesday . 
Harding , 42 , was one of five people who died when the helicopter crashed into a field on the way back to London after a match between Chelsea and Bolton Wanderers in northwest England . 
earlier this year , Harding hit the headlines when he donated one million pounds ( $ 1.60 million ) to the opposition Labour Party , the biggest donation by an individual in the party &apos;s 90-year history . 
Harding , Britain &apos;s 89th richest man , began his working life as an office junior . 
by his early 40s he was the chairman of one of Britain &apos;s most profitable reinsurance companies , Benfield Group Ltd . 
although Chelsea &apos;s most prominent supporters include Major and former Conservative cabinet minister David Mellor , Harding was a supporter of the left-leaning Labour Party . 
despite his great wealth and jet-set lifestyle , Harding endeared himself to Chelsea fans with his down-to-earth ways . 
on match days , he would take a train into London and enjoy a beer in the Imperial Arms , a pub near Chelsea &apos;s Stamford Bridge football ground . 
last year , Harding was involved in a public feud with Chelsea chairman Ken Bates year over control of the club , but the dispute was finally resolved amicably . 
he bought the Stamford Bridge ground in London &apos;s Fulham Road for 16.5 million pounds ( $ 26 million ) in 1995 and provided more cash for stadium improvements and to buy top overseas players including Italians Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Di Matteo and France &apos;s Franck Leboeuf .
