a handful of pro-democracy activists chanting &quot; Power to the People &quot; released caged pigeons on Sunday and staged a sit-down protest outside the building where the British will hand Hong Kong over to China . 
the pigeons , perhaps caged for too long , failed to soar into the skies in a symbolic gesture of freedom and instead crash-landed under the wheels of passing traffic . 
they had to be rescued by tightlipped police motorcycle patrolmen . 
undaunted , the dozen or so vocal protesters vowed to sit tight for the next 30 hours until China &apos;s flag rises over Hong Kong , to demonstrate their opposition to Beijing &apos;s appointed legislature to be installed just hours after the British depart . 
more than a century and a half of British rule draws to a close at midnight on Monday , a transition to be marked by a solemn ceremony headed by British heir to the throne Prince Charles and Chinese president Jiang Zemin . 
&quot; superficially , the end of colonial rule signifies that we will no longer be under foreign rule and repression , &quot; said Andrew Cheng , a leader of the organising group , the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature . 
&quot; But the establishment of the Provisional Legislature shows a short period of a dark age has come . 
Cheng , an elected member of the existing Legislative Council , will lose his seat along with fellow members of the pro-democracy lobby when China dissolves the chamber , undoing in a stroke the mild democratic reforms instigated by the last British Governor Chris Patten to China &apos;s fury . 
&quot; Freeing the birds means we hope that democracy here will soon be set free , &quot; Cheng added . 
one pigeon died under the wheels of a bus . 
the rest apparently survived .
