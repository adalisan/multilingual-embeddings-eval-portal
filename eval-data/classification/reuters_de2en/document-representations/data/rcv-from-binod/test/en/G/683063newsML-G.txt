Greek Cypriot refugees on Tuesday urged the government to call a referendum among refugees to determine whether a solution to the protracted dispute splitting the island should be federal one . 
chanting &quot; Cyprus is Greek &quot; and waving Greek flags , between 300 and 400 refugees from the northern district of Kyrenia gathered outside the presidential palace in the capital Nicosia demanding to be heard . 
&quot; In view of the talks next month we are here to express their concern at the fate of Kyrenia , &quot; said Gregoris Katsellis , a member of the refugees organisation which organised the gathering . 
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides , as leader of the Greek Cypriot community , and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash are due to start a series of consultations starting July 9 on how the decades old dispute can be resolved . 
Turkish troops seized northern Cyprus in July 1974 in the wake of a brief abortive coup in Nicosia engineered by the military ruling Greece . 
the two sides have agreed to reunite Cyprus under a federal umbrella , but key disagreements remain on territorial , constitutional and security aspects of the solution . 
&quot; If Kyrenia is left out of a solution to the Cyprus problem then that is not a solution , &quot; said Katsellis , a member of the refugees organisation which organised the gathering . 
Greek Cypriot refugees from Kyrenia fear the district will come under the administration of the Turkish Cypriot canton of the federated state . 
the invasion displaced an estimated 180,000 to 200,000 Greek Cypriots who were forced to move to the island &apos;s south . 
around 40,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the south moved north .
