President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal will meet South African President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on Wednesday for talks on the disputed Pacific territory of East Timor , Sampaio &apos;s office said . 
it was the latest move in an apparent bid by the South African leader to speed an accord between Portugal , the former colonial ruler , and Indonesia , the current ruler , on the future of East Timor . 
Mandela saw Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta , the exiled spokesman for jailed Timor resistance leader Xanana Gusmao , in South Africa last Friday . 
at that time , Mandela announced his intention to invite Sampaio for discussions . 
Mandela , once the world &apos;s most famous political prisoner , was reported by Portuguese media at the weekend to have asked Indonesia to free Gusmao , who is serving a 20-year sentence for resisting Indonesian rule . 
on a recent visit to Indonesia , Mandela secured the temporary release of Gusmao from Jakarta &apos;s notorious Cipinang jail and dined with him at the government guest house next to President Suharto &apos;s palace . 
there has been speculation in Portugal that Mandela is preparing a new initiative to bring about a settlement of the long-running dispute over East Timor . 
the island was annexed by Indonesia two decades ago in a move never recognised by the United Nations . 
but while ready to use his undoubted influence for peace , the South African leader has said he is not trying to usurp the role of the U.N. which has been brokering so far unsuccessful talks between Portugal and Indonesia . 
the Portuguese news agency LUSA said Ramos Horta denied on Monday there was any question of a deal involving freedom for Gusmao in exchange for his going into exile . 
&quot; Xanana will not accept any conditional release involving exile , &quot; Ramos Horta was quoted as saying in Cape Verde , the African archipelago that is also a former Portuguese colony . 
he said that the issue had not even been raised in discussions with Mandela . 
Ramos Horta , who won the 1996 Peace Prize jointly with East Timor bishop Carlos Belo , said that self-determination for the largely Roman Catholic territory remained the goal of his movement . 
Indonesia , the world &apos;s most populous Moslem country , annexed East Timor a year after the Portuguese withdrew from the territory , which is 500 km ( 300 miles ) northwest of Australia . 
up to 200,000 people are believed to have died in the takeover and a subsequent famine . 
Portugal backs the resistance movement &apos;s call for the people of Timor , where a small guerrilla force is still active , to be allowed to vote on their future . 
Indonesia counters that the people , through a meeting of tribal leaders , freely chose in 1976 to integrate with their huge Moslem neighbour and as such there is no need for any vote on self-determination .
