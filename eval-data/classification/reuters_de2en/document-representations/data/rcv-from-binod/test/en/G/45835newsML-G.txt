thousands of women supporters of female circumcision marched in Sierra Leone &apos;s capital Freetown to protest against campaigns to end the traditional ritual practice . 
the women marched to state house on Tuesday and urged President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah to halt public debate on the Bondo Secret Society , a female circumcision group to which they belong . 
&quot; We demand that international organisations and non-governmental organisations in the country stop interfering with our traditional practices and beliefs , &quot; Sunbean Rogers , a representative of the society told Kabbah . 
doctors and foreign aid groups have denounced the practice of female genital mutilation as a serious health risk for girls who undergo the operation . 
prevalent in many parts of Africa and the Middle East , it involves removal or all or part of the clitoris and can cause excessive bleeding and loss of sexual sensation . 
the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals ruled in June in the case of a Togolese woman that fear of genital mutilation at home was grounds for U.S. asylum . 
newspapers in Freetown reported similar protests in favour of the practice on Saturday in the impoverished West African nation &apos;s second city of Bo .
