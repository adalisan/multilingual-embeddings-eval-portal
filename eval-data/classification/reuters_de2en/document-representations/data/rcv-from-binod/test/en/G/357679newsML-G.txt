former Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan , who made no impact in national and provincial elections , said on Wednesday he expected to emerge as the main opposition and win the next polls . 
&quot; I think that next election , God willing , we will be unstoppable , &quot; he told Reuters Television in an interview . 
&quot; Whether it &apos;s the next election or the next one after that , there &apos;s no question of ever giving up until we bring about a change , &quot; he said after his newly-formed Tehrik-i-Insaaf ( Justice Movement ) failed to come even close to winning a seat in Monday &apos;s elections . 
&quot; We really didn &apos;t expect to do a lot better than we did , &quot; he said of a party formed last April and far from ready to contest the elections , which former prime minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s Pakistan Muslim League won in a landslide . 
&quot; It was really like pitting an under-19 cricket team against a professional test cricket team . 
but , really , we knew all that going in , &quot; he said . 
Imran , 43 , said he expected his party to take over as the national opposition from the Pakistan People &apos;s Party of Benazir Bhutto , sacked in November on disputed corruption charges and humiliated in the elections with just 18 seats in the 217-member National Assembly . 
&quot; We will , I think , be the only national opposition now because People &apos;s Party has been completely destroyed , &quot; he said . 
Imran said the low turnout , officially around 40 percent , showed there was an opportunity for a third party appealing to those disenchanted by what he called a corrupt political mafia who saw elections as business and were prepared to spend huge amounts of money to win a seat . 
&quot; Then they have to get it back and they get it back through corruption . 
hence the level of corruption increases every election , &quot; he said . 
that means 75 percent of the people did not vote . 
in that 75 percent , I feel , we are the ones who are going to tap it , &quot; Imran said . 
&quot; What they have shown is that they did not think we were ready . 
they did not think we were a viable force . 
Imran said the elections had shortened the time needed to organise his party nationally . 
&quot; This is a great beginning . 
now to strengthen this network will , I think , take about a year , &quot; he said . 
some analysts say Imran is unlikely ever to win power because of his playboy past and his marriage to 23-year-old Jemima Goldsmith , a convert to Islam and daughter of Anglo-French magnate Sir James Goldsmith , who is Jewish . 
there have been widespread allegations of a &quot; Zionist conspiracy &quot; backing Imran that he said had been tough to fight . 
&quot; The Muslim League was very clever in the way they exploited this &apos; Jewish conspiracy &apos; . 
they latched on to it and they really hammered it into the people in every speech how Israeli money has come in to support me , &quot; Imran said . 
&quot; You can use it in one election , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Something that is so based on lies just cannot last . 
sooner or later , people will see through this . 
Imran said he would not change tactics despite Tehrik-i-Insaaf &apos;s election failure . 
&quot; Today , I could easily have , not perhaps won the election , but I could have been the second biggest party in Pakistan . 
all I had to do was to take professional politicians into my party , disgruntled politicians from both sides , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But that would not bring about a change in this country . 
change can only come with new people who don &apos;t have a vested interest in protecting this system . 
nevertheless , Imran admitted he had difficulty drawing new people into election politics . 
&quot; It &apos;s not that there is a shortage of honest people . 
the problem is they &apos;re scared . 
they &apos;re scared because of the campaign I went through , the personal attacks , the mudslinging in the newspapers , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There &apos;s fear of political victimisation , which has happened time and time again .
