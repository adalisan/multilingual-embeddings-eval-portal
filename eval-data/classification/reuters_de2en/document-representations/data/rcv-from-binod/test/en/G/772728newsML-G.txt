China &apos;s envoy in Hong Kong said on Friday that Sino-British relations could improve if London refrained from interfering in the former colony &apos;s affairs . 
Ma Yuzhen , the Hong Kong commissioner of China &apos;s Foreign Ministry , made the comments in response to Britain &apos;s minister responsible for Hong Kong affairs , Derek Fatchett , who said it was time to put aside the past and look to the future . 
Britain handed Hong Kong backed to China on July 1 , ending 156 years of colonial rule . 
&quot; With the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty ... , this question of Hong Kong which is left over from history is resolved , which could provide us with new opportunities for further developing a good relations between the two countries , &quot; Ma told the Hong Kong government radio in an interview . 
&quot; In order to make sure the Sino-British relations continue to develop in the right direction ... I think it is important that our relations are guided by the principle of mutual respect , dealing with each other on equal footing and not interfering in each others &apos; internal affairs , &quot; Ma said . 
Britain has said Hong Kong was still its concern after July 1 as it is a signator to a 1984 United Nations registered Sino-British treaty , setting out the handover arrangements . 
Sino-British relations hit a snag when former Governor Chris Patten launched electoral reforms in the twilight years of colonial rule despite fierce opposition by Beijing . 
Chinese officials launched a stinging attack on Patten , calling him &quot; a political prostitute &quot; and &quot; sinner for a thousand years &quot; in public . 
&quot; As long as there is no interfering in China &apos;s internal affairs , then I am quite sure that the sour feeling will be gone , &quot; Ma said . 
Ma earlier told a local television station that his role was to deal with foreign affairs and that he was not an overlord to Hong Kong &apos;s leader Tung Chee-hwa . 
Beijing has promised the territory of 6.4 million people that it can keep its political and economic way of life unchanged for 50 years and run its own affairs except defence and diplomacy . 
but doubts have been raised as to whether Tung would have a free hand to run Hong Kong as Beijing-inspired proposals to curb civil and political liberties had been accepted by Tung , who was chosen by a China-backed committee .
