a lightly traded Australian share market softened at the opening on Tuesday after interest rate fears again got the better of Wall Street . 
the All Ordinaries index shed six points to 2,439.8 . 
activity was muted as traders awaited the impact of Tuesday &apos;s wage claim verdict from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and Wednesday &apos;s March quarter inflation data . 
&quot; New York was down on the back of interest rate fears again , &quot; said a Sydney-based dealer , suggesting that losses were likely to be modest as the market awaited today &apos;s wage claim verdict and Wednesday &apos;s inflation data . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t expect to be down any more than 10 points or so . 
we are still waiting for some figures . 
falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about five to four , while about 47 percent of stocks traded remained steady .
