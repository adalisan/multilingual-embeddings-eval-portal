the Kremlin said on Friday President Boris Yeltsin was strictly following doctor &apos;s orders by limiting his workload before planned heart surgery , but rapped the Western media over coverage of his illness . 
Yeltsin &apos;s press secretary , Sergei Yastrzhembsky , said the president was working two to three hours a day at Moscow &apos;s Central Clinical Hospital and there were no immediate plans to change the schedule . 
&quot; Work with documents will be continued for two to three hours a day . 
the president will also have meetings on an individual basis when necessary , &quot; Yastrzhembsky told reporters . 
doctors said on Wednesday that Yeltsin , 65 , was fit enough for a heart operation , but that surgery would be postponed for at least six weeks . 
the operation -- a relatively routine bypass operation -- will improve the blood supply to Yeltsin &apos;s heart . 
in Yeltsin &apos;s prolonged absence , national security adviser Alexander Lebed and opposition communist leader Gennady Zyuganov have suggested instability and chaos could be just over the horizon . 
Yeltsin announced his decision to undergo heart surgery in a television interview on September 5 , breaking a long Kremlin tradition of secrecy about the health of Russian leaders . 
he has been in hospital since September 13 . 
Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin &apos;s health problems were no longer taboo but urged the media , particularly Western journalists , to respect &quot; a certain framework of dignity and ethics &quot; . 
&quot; Sometimes I feel like asking you to spare the president , especially the Western media ... I believe that -- this is my personal view -- the Western mass media have been using double standards in covering the president &apos;s illness , &quot; he said . 
explaining the charge of double standards , he made clear that he believed that Western media had shown more sympathy when covering former French president Francois Mitterrand &apos;s fight with cancer than in their coverage of Yeltsin &apos;s illness . 
Yeltsin had two heart attacks last year and doctors say he may have had another one just before he was re-elected for a new four-year term last July . 
the Kremlin had not previously announced the third heart attack , despite its openness policy , and has already criticised speculation over Yeltsin &apos;s health by some foreign newspapers . 
an opinion poll published by Interfax news agency on Friday said a majority of those questioned approved of Yeltsin &apos;s decision to admit to the need for heart surgery . 
the poll by the respected Public Opinion agency said 60 percent of respondents praised his openness and 17 percent were not in favour . 
others had no definite opinion or did not care . 
another poll , issued by the VTsIOM organisation , said more than two thirds of people it surveyed believed that Yeltsin had completely or partially relinquished control of the government and his own administration . 
but fewer than a third of respondents believed this could lead to unrest or instability . 
more than a half thought important decisions could be made without Yeltsin , according to the VTsIOM data published in the Sevodnya newspaper . 
Lebed and Zyuganov said on Thursday problems were piling up in Russia and action was needed . 
Zyuganov , who has presidential ambitions , said Yeltisn should resign . 
Lebed got down to tackling one of the major problems , the conflict in breakaway Chechnya , by flying to the Ingushetia region of southern Russia for talks with regional leaders . 
Interfax said Chechen separatist leaders had expressed their satisfaction with the talks and repeated their support for peace moves led by Lebed .
