Senegal &apos;s President Abdou Diouf said on Friday he was proposing his foreign minister Moustapha Niasse for the post of United Nations secretary general . 
Diouf announced the bid to reporters when he returned from the Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso where an African successor to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was discussed . 
the United States has vetoed a second term for the Egyptian but left the door open for another African candidate . 
&quot; If Africa does not wish to lose its turn we have to act fast , &quot; Diouf said . 
&quot; Some of my brother heads of state asked me if I wouldn &apos;t nominate Moustapha Niasse . 
Niasse , 57 , is a technocrat who attended universities in Dakar and Paris . 
his candidacy has been mentioned along with that of about four other Africans , but he runs a high risk of a Chinese veto for Senegal &apos;s recognition of Taiwan . 
China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and Diouf acknowledged the possibility of a backlash over his decision last January to establish ties with Taipei . 
&quot; I am aware of all the objections that could be made . 
it is left to God and the Security Council , &quot; Diouf said . 
the Organisation of African Unity which had stood behind Boutros-Ghali gave its go-ahead last week for other African candidates to enter the fray after Washington exercised a veto . 
President Bill Clinton says the world body needs a new leader to reform it for the 21st century . 
he criticised the management style of the 75-year-old Boutros-Ghali , whose five-year term runs out at the end of this month . 
the Egyptian has &quot; suspended &quot; his bid for reappointment .
