hurricane Danny threatened coastlines from Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle with high winds and torrential rains late Friday and claimed at least two lives after raking the tip of Louisiana . 
residents of beachfront communities along the Gulf of Mexico loaded up on household supplies , nailed plywood sheets over their windows and prepared to ride out the deluge . 
others joined long lines at gas stations before venturing into a steady stream of traffic heading inland . 
a minimal hurricane , packing sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 km ) and an expected storm surge of 4-5 feet above normal , Danny was due to make landfall a second time early Saturday , according to the National weather Service . 
hurricane force winds extended about 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the centre , with the strongest gusts on the east side of the storm . 
the National weather Service maintained hurricane warnings from Grand Isle , Lousiana , to Destin , Florida , but said new warnings could be issued for communities farther east along the Florida Panhandle as the slow-moving hurricane gathered strength . 
as the storm approached , the Alabama Marine Police reported that an elderly man died of a heart attack while securing his boat in Pirate &apos;s Cove , Alabama , near the Florida border . 
the body of a Texas man was discovered in a swamped sailboat that broke up in heavy waves near Fort Morgan , Alabama . 
the U.S. Coast Guard rescued a surfer in 8-10 foot seas off Panama City , Florida , while rescuers in Mississippi saved two men whose boat capsized near Biloxi . 
high winds caused sporadic power outages . 
but officials said the biggest worry was flash-flooding near rivers , streams and waterlogged lowlands as forecasts called for 20 inches of rain along the storm &apos;s track . 
&quot; We don &apos;t get too shook up over 75 mph winds . 
the problem is when it &apos;s sustained for hours on end , &quot; said melody Bradley , director of the Jackson County Port Authority in Pascagoula , Mississippi . 
the governors of Mississippi and Alabama each declared a state of emergency , while authorities in southern Alabama issued a voluntary evacuation of low-lying coastal areas . 
all but one of the 11 floating casinos moored along the Mississippi coastline kept their doors open to a trickle of diehard gamblers and tourists . 
the storm first made landfall early Friday in Louisiana , between Grand Isle and the mouth of the Mississippi River . 
high winds , steady rain and wind-driven water bombarded Plaquemines Parish southeast of New Orleans Friday afternoon . 
but roads reopened about 12 hours after Hurricane Danny punched into the &quot; toe &quot; of Louisiana &apos;s boot-shaped coastline . 
about 100 boats appeared to have been damaged or sunk at a large Marina in Buras , La . , where storm waters rose four to five feet ( 1.2 to 1.5 metres ) within a few minutes earlier in the day . 
in nearby areas , house trailers were overturned , roofs blown off and trees and utility poles snapped , he said . 
the crew of the fishing boat nasty Two rode out the storm in the captain &apos;s cabin of their partially sunken boat after rescuing two other fisherman from a sinking boat in the Empire deepwater canal . 
the nasty Two was tossed onto rocks and sank in shallow water , the Coast Guard said . 
West of Plaquemines , officials in Grand Isle , Louisiana &apos;s only inhabited barrier island , reported heavy damage and erosion . 
most of the island &apos;s 1,530 residents obeyed a mandatory evacuation order Thursday and moved inland .
