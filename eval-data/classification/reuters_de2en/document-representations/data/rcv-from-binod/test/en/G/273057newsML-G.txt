the former wife of Peru &apos;s President Alberto Fujimori offered her own advice on Monday on how to end the six-day hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence : drug the rebels . 
while her ex-husband stuck to a tough negotiating stance and considered military options , Susana Higuchi said she could bring a peaceful conclusion in minutes . 
&quot; It &apos;s simple . 
they should put something in the water they drink so that they all fall asleep , &quot; Higuchi said at the police hospital where she had gone to meet some of the 225 hostages released late on Sunday night . 
once the roughly 20 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) guerrillas are sleeping soundly , police could enter the building , set free the remaining 140 hostages and arrest the rebels , said Higuchi . 
main water supplies were cut off at the start of the siege on Tuesday , and the Red Cross has been delivering drinking water daily to the residence . 
Fujimori divorced Higuchi in 1995 after a bitter separation during which he locked her out of the presidential home after she accused him of corruption and authoritarianism . 
their daugher , Keiko Sofia Fujimori , acts as First Lady .
