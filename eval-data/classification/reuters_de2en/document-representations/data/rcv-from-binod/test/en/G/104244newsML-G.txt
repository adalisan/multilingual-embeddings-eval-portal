Alan Shearer scored twice in the first half as England recovered their composure to beat Poland 2-1 in their European group two World Cup qualifier at Wembley on Wednesday . 
the visitors took the lead after just six minutes through Marek Citko , evoking uneasy memories for home fans of 1973 when Poland stole a 1-1 draw at Wembley to ensure England missed out on the 1974 World Cup finals . 
a cross from the right fooled both Gareth Southgate and Gary Neville , and Citko pulled the ball down and slotted a low shot under England &apos; keeper David seaman . 
but Shearer , the world &apos;s costliest player , equalised 18 minutes later , escaping his marker and heading home a deep right flank cross from David Beckham , making his Wembley debut for his country . 
England , striving to repeat their fine performaces from the European championship in June , finally began to settle and their second goal justified coach Glenn Hoddle &apos;s decision to play striker Les Ferdinand alongside Newcastle team-mate Shearer . 
the two players exchanged passes on the edge of the box , Shearer &apos;s first shot was deflected to Ferdinand , who scrambled the ball clear of the Polish defence for Shearer to blast his second attempt past Porto goalkeeper Andrzej Wozniak . 
Poland defied pre-match expectations and made England work for their three points , with captain Piotr Nowak , who plays his club football in Germany with Munich 1860 , outstanding . 
the second half was just as evenly balanced and the Poles often looked capable of drawing level in a fluctuating game assisted by sensitive refereeing from German Hellmut Krug . 
Shearer , who has now scored seven goals from open play in his last six England appearances , came close to a hat-trick from a long-range freekick . 
the Poles pushed hard in the final 15 minutes but , in the end , Shearer &apos;s prowess in front of goal proved the difference . 
&quot; It wasn &apos;t a vintage performance but we did just enough to get a result which is what counts . 
we started sloppily for some reason but we got the goals we deserved , &quot; Shearer said . 
Hoddle was happy with the result , which maintained his side &apos;s 100 per cent qualifying record after two matches , but was less than impressed with his side &apos;s performance . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we really had our defensive heads on throughout the game ... in many ways there are things for us to do , &quot; he said .
