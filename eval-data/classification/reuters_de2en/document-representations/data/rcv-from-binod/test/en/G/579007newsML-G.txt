Sydney &apos;s cruising yacht Club &apos;s Sid Fischer has become the first Australian competitor to unfurl his Ensign for the America &apos;s Cup challenge in the year 2000 . 
two Australian syndicates , led by Iain Murray and Dennis O &apos;Neil have pulled out of the 1999 elimination rounds . 
they &apos;ve quit because of difficulties in gaining the legal ownership of the One Australia challenge equipment and the mounting costs of the event in Auckland . 
the year 2000 race will be Fischer &apos;s fifth attempt at yachting &apos;s holy grail , a feat equalled only by British yachtsman Sir Thomas Lipton . 
Fischer is expected to be up against only one other Australian competitor in the race . 
new South Wales Premier Bob Carr has sent a congratulatory telegram to Susie Maroney on behalf of the people of New South Wales . 
a State reception will also be held to honour the swimmer when she returns to Sydney . 
Mr Carr says Susie Maroney is a shining example of the rewards of motivation and hard work , and continues the great Australian tradition of marathon swimming . 
the Federal Opposition says more budget funds , not less , are needed to support farmers along the east coast of Australia . 
a review has recommended the Rural Adjustment Scheme be scrapped and replaced with a new business support program . 
but the Opposition wants the Primary Industries Minister , John Anderson , to abandon the plans to cut the assistance . 
shadow Primary Industries Minister , Neil O &apos;Keefe , says thousands of farmers in the eastern states are still experiencing extremely dry conditions . 
national Party Whip , Mark Vaile , says this morning &apos;s meeting of National Party M-Ps decided to wait until they see the native title legislation , before giving it the final thumbs up . 
Mr Vaile says no motion was moved against leader , Tim Fischer . 
he says discussions on Wik are now being pursued in a joint Party meeting in Canberra . 
voluntary euthanasia campaigner Phillip Nitschke says he believes the treatment he provided to cancer patient Esther Wild , who died last month , was perfectly legal . 
Dr Nitschke says he &apos;s not surprised the Northern Territory coroner has ordered an investigation into the death of Ms Wild . 
Ms Wild , who suffered from a rare form of stomach cancer , died at the end of a four day drug-induced coma . 
she &apos;d qualified to use the Territory Right To Die law , but the Senate overturned it before she was able to access it . 
territory Police say they expect to interview her partner Martin Williams and Dr Nitschke during the investigation . 
and while Susie Maroney took 24 hours to swim from Cuba to the United States , a Longreach Shearer is planning a different way to spend the day , and make history . 
Glen Parker wants to set a new world record for endurance shearing by fleecing 500 sheep over the next 24 hours , the existing record stands at nine hours .
