Britain , in a surprise move aimed at keeping the lid on inflation , Wednesday announced a quarter-point increase in interest rates to 6 percent . 
the move was announced after a morning meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George . 
Clarke had recently been resisting pressure for a rate rise from George , who has been concerned the economy was in danger of over-heating . 
explaining his decision to raise rates less than a month before his annual budget , Clarke said : &quot; We have delivered a combination of healthy growth and sustained low inflation unseen for a generation . 
&quot; I am determined to maintain a firm grip on inflation to sustain this well into the future . 
George said the move was a pre-emptive one , designed to choke off any inflationary pressures before they took hold . 
&quot; Moving now to moderate the accelerating pace of the economic upswing is likely to mean that we will need to tighten policy by less than we would otherwise , &quot; George said . 
interest rates were last changed in June , when they were cut to 5.75 from 6 percent in a move opposed by George . 
the underlying rate of inflation , the gauge most closely watched by the Conservative government , is 2.9 percent . 
the government target is 2.5 percent . 
the rate hike triggered a rise in the pound sterling , buoyant over the past month , to 2.457 marks from 2.450 before the news . 
but government bonds slipped and the London stock market fell in the face of probable increases in bank lending rates . 
the ruling Conservatives must face the electorate by May 1997 and face an uphill battle to overcome a Labour opposition that is well ahead in opinion polls . 
Clarke had been dampening expectations of tax cuts in his Nov . 26 budget . 
they are being heavily promoted by Conservative right-wingers as an election-winning move . 
&quot; Mr. Clarke has finally given in to Mr. George . 
he &apos;s finally been worn down by the governor . 
it &apos;s far enough away from an election for the electorate to forget about it , &quot; said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC Investment Bank .
