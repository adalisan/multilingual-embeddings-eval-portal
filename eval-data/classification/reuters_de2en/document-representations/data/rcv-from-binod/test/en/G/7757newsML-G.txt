in a significant new offer to Taiwan , China has said it is time for the two rivals to hold political talks and that Taipei should take practical steps towards that goal . 
consultations should be held to set the time and format of the talks , Tang Shubei , executive vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits , was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency . 
&quot; We have noticed that the Taiwan side has come to realise the necessity to hold political talks between the two sides of the Straits , &quot; Tang said , according to the report issued late on Wednesday . 
Tang , China &apos;s top negotiator with Taiwan , told a visiting group from Taiwan that the two sides should settle political disputes through negotiations with the eventual goal of reunification . 
&quot; Consultations should be held , on an equal footing , to set the mutually acceptable pattern , time and method for holding the talks , the agency said . 
China suspended talks with Taiwan last year shortly before Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to the United States . 
China and Taiwan have been rivals since the end of the civil war in 1949 . 
Beijing considers the island a renegade province . 
Tang added that he hoped Taiwan would take concrete and practical actions , adding that the island should stop efforts to create &quot; Two Chinas &quot; or &quot; One China , One Taiwan . 
those are Beijing &apos;s code words for what it fears is a Taiwan plot to abandon a policy of reunification and take a separatist path . 
the offer of renewed talks followed China &apos;s announcement earlier in the week of a series of regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links , which Taiwan still bans .
