Belgian parliament has received a report on child sex allegations against Deputy Prime Minister Elio di Rupo from Belgium &apos;s top court , a parliament official said on Monday . 
she said faction leaders of all parties would meet at 1500 local ( 1400 GMT ) to decide when a special commission will review the report . 
the long-awaited decision should end the agony of the Belgian government , which has been virtually paralysed since the allegations against Di Rupo first surfaced three weeks ago . 
Parliament on November 21 asked the Cour de Cassation , the country &apos;s highest court , to investigate allegations that Di Rupo had sex with under age boys , and to report back by December 9 . 
Di Rupo , 45 , has denied the allegations . 
the accusations came at a time of crisis in Belgium over revelations of a child sex and paedophilia ring responsible for the deaths of several young children . 
there is no suggestion of any link between Di Rupo and such a ring but the accusation further undermines the authority of government in acting . 
the court report is expected to state whether there is enough evidence to warrant indicting the number two in the centre-left coalition government . 
the parliament official said it was not sure whether the commission would meet today or on Tuesday . 
the commission will make a recommendation to parliament which will then vote on it in plenary session in the coming days . 
Parliament has three options . 
it can decide the allegations against Di Rupo are unfounded and clear his name , it can decide to indict him or it can ask the Court for a further investigation . 
it is also possible that the Court itself asks for more time to investigate . 
in Belgium , only parliament can indict ministers and only the Cour de Cassation can try them . 
a similar procedure brought down former NATO Secretary General Willy Claes , who was forced to resign in October 1995 after parliament indicted him over allegations of bribery when he was a Belgian economics minister in the late eighties . 
an indictment would mean sending Di Rupo to the Cour de Cassation for a full investigation -- a move which would end his political career . 
one of the incidental consequences of the investigation into Di Rupo has been the exposure to the public of his homosexuality and a discussion of the merits of a homosexual holding office . 
attitudes to homosexuality and political power vary within European countries but tend to the conservative in most . 
the chairman of francophone Christian-Democrat government party said last week that a minister could not be openly gay .
