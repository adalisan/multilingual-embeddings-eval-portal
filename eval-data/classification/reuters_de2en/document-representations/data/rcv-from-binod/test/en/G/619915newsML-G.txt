Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. 
Patterson arrived in Havana on Wednesday at the start of a four-day visit to Cuba , the first by a Jamaican premier to the neighbouring Caribbean island in two decades . 
Patterson , accompanied by a trade delegation , was met at Havana airport by President Fidel Castro . 
the two did not speak to waiting reporters . 
Patterson was due to hold talks with Castro on Thursday morning , part of a programme that will also include trips to one of Cuba &apos;s two recently opened free trade zones and to a biotechnology centre . 
the last Jamaican prime minister to travel to Havana to meet with Castro was the late Michael Manley , who visited in 1977 . 
Patterson accompanied Manley on that trip as foreign minister . 
Patterson has made clear Jamaica does not agree with Washington &apos;s policy of seeking to isolate the communist-ruled island . 
the Jamaican leader said at a summit of Caribbean leaders and U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this month in Barbados that he would like to see steps taken to integrate Cuba more into the Caribbean and also into the hemisphere .
