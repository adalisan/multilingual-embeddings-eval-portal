the Corel WTA Tour announced a new rankings system on Thursday designed to encourage top players to compete more often . 
the new system , which takes effect the week of December 23 , 1996 , is based on total points earned over a 52-week period rather than on an averaging of points based on playing a minimum number of events . 
with each new week of competition , points from the same calendar week of the previous year drop off . 
the old system , used since 1983 , used a divisor of 14 to reach an average that determined the ranking . 
&quot; This is an incentive to play more tournaments . 
it should strengthen tournaments around the world and help build rivalries and excitement , &quot; said Anne person Worcester , CEO of the tour . 
&quot; This should help get top players playing more often and eliminating the divisor should make it easier for the public to follow the rankings . 
it should also create more movement in the rankings . 
just as this year , players will be required to play a minimum of 12 tour events besides the Grand slams and season-ending championships in order to qualify for a full share of bonus pool money at the end of the season . 
world number one Steffi Graf and co-world number two Monica Seles , who have both struggled with injuries that have limited their tournament appearances , have openly criticised the new system , saying it will put a greater strain on players . 
the plan was passed , however , by Women &apos;s Tennis Association members and Worcester believes the added rewards of playing a busier schedule will not detract from the big events . 
&quot; You still have to do well at the majors , &quot; said Worcester , alluding to the extra ranking points at stake for Grand Slam events . 
&quot; But this will probably have them ( top players ) looking over their shoulder a little more now . 
this year , for example , Graf has held on to the number one ranking despite playing in only 10 tournaments . 
the German , who won the French , Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles this year , lost only four matches all year and maintained her lofty status because her points average remained the best despite factoring in zeroes for the four tournaments she was shy of the divisor of 14 . 
standing to benefit could be current co-world number two Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain , who this year played in 17 tournaments . 
next year , Sanchez would get to keep her points from all 17 events rather than have her total divided by 14 .
