House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Friday that he will stress to Chinese leaders U.S. interest in their handling of China &apos;s takeover of Hong Kong when he visits the region next week . 
Gingrich visits China and Hong Kong as head of a 12-member congressional delegation on an Asian trip that will include Japan , South Korea and Taiwan . 
the delegation flies out of Washington on Sunday , one day after Vice President Al Gore also leaves for an Asia trip . 
Gingrich said he planned to stress the strong American interest in Hong Kong and express concern about &quot; some of the steps backward &quot; from the accord under which Britain will return its colony to Chinese rule on July 1 . 
&quot; People all over the world will be watching , therefore it &apos;s a great opportunity for the Beijing government to manage it in a way which will either strengthen or weaken public understanding of the direction in which they are going , &quot; he said . 
the House recently adopted a resolution expressing support for Hong Kong &apos;s autonomy . 
in Beijing , a commentary in the People &apos;s Daily on Thursday denounced what it called interference in China &apos;s internal affairs . 
Gingrich said the delegation would discuss wide-ranging issues in Beijing that would include human rights , concerns about religious persecution , &quot; the rule of law , &quot; and the Taiwan issue . 
he said it was possible that reports that China might be planning to funnel campaign contributions to U.S. politicians might also come up in talks with the Chinese . 
Gingrich said the delegation would stress in both Taipei and Beijing that reunification of Taiwan with China be voluntary . 
he said it was also important to tell the Taiwanese to &quot; do nothing provocative , &quot; and to communicate to Beijing U.S. resolve to defend Taiwan against any overt aggression . 
the delegation would also convey U.S. concern about Taiwanese plans to send nuclear waste to North Korea , &quot; something we think is very undesirable , &quot; Gingrich said . 
in Japan , the delegation &apos;s talks will include emphasis on the need to lift barriers to U.S. exports , Gingrich said .
