backers of joint flow control and interstate waste legislation launched a last-ditch campaign on Capitol Hill Thursday to turn around opponents of the measure . 
the Government Finance Officers Association sent a letter to congressional leaders and members of key House and Senate panels urging them to give final approval to flow control language that recently was tacked on to the Senate &apos;s fiscal year 1997 funding bill for energy and water programs . 
&quot; This narrowly drawn and much needed amendment would avert downgradings and defaults of municipal bonds issued to finance municipal solid waste facilities by permitting limited flow control authority , &quot; GFOA said . 
Congressional backers of pending language to restrict the movement of interstate waste held a joint press briefing today to push for passage of the interstate waste / flow control measure . 
&quot; We need to work as a team to push this through , &quot; Sen. Arlen Specter , R-Pa , said at the press briefing . 
in a surprise move , the Senate voted July 26 to add the flow control and interstate waste provisions to the energy and water funding bill in an effort to end run the House Commerce Committee . 
earlier this year , Commerce panel chairman Rep. Thomas Bliley , R-Va . , declared that flow control legislation is probably dead for the rest of 1996 after a narrow measure he backed failed on the House floor this winter .
