several British doctors stepped into a growing debate over abortion on Friday , declaring that women who want to terminate their pregnancies should not fear that the foetus is suffering . 
in a clear message to anti-abortion groups which have presented videotape of foetuses twitching and apparently grimacing in the womb , the doctors said unborn babies could not feel pain . 
several papers in the British Medical Journal addressed the issue and their consensus was that foetuses &apos; nervous systems were not advanced enough to experience pain , at least not before about 17 weeks . 
&quot; Can a foetus feel pain ? 
given the definitions of feeling and pain the answer must be no , &quot; wrote Adrian Lloyd-Thomas of London &apos;s Great Ormond Street Hospital for children and Maria Fitzgerald of University College London . 
babies showed reflexes to what could be painful stimuli , they said , but did not have enough brain development to register this consciously . 
&quot; Scientific evidence suggests women considering abortion can be assured that foetuses do not experience pain in the way that people who oppose abortion claim , &quot; said Dr Stuart Derbyshire of the University of Manchester . 
Vivette Glover and Nicholas Fisk of Queen Charlotte &apos;s and Chelsea Hospital in London said no one really knew if or when a foetus became conscious , so it would be better to err on the side of caution . 
&quot; The question of pain or suffering during termination of pregnancy is especially difficult , &quot; they wrote . 
&quot; terminations are usually carried out before 20 weeks , when it is particularly uncertain whether the foetus feels anything at all . 
it may feel something , however , especially towards mid-gestation . 
doctors used to say that new born babies could not feel pain , but studies have since shown that they do . 
but the doctors , all paediatricians , obstetricians or neurologists , writing in the British Medical Journal said foetuses were different from newborns . 
the abortion debate has come to the fore in Britain since recent reports of a woman who had one healthy twin aborted but kept another . 
a second woman who took fertility drugs announced she would try to carry eight foetuses to term . 
doctors say the second woman should have some of the foetuses aborted to prevent them all dying . 
anti-abortion groups have been very vocal in their opposition , demanding a re-think of Britain &apos;s abortion laws . 
&quot; These articles are a useful balance to what has been , until now , a hysterical and ill-informed discussion , &quot; said Ann Furedi of the birth Control Trust charity . 
&quot; Doctors are not sadists . 
they perform abortions to relieve the suffering of women , not because they wish to inflict suffering on foetuses .
