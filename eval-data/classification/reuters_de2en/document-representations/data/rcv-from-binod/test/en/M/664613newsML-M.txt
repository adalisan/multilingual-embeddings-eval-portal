the Norwegian crown weakened considerably on Monday morning in thin trade apparently due to stop-loss selling by foreign investors , market players said . 
the crown stood at 4.2150 crowns against the German mark and at 103.54 against the inverse European Currency Unit index at 0940 GMT . 
&quot; This is probably speculation by foreigners , &quot; Eirik Larsen , senior financial analyst at DnB , told Reuters . 
&quot; There is nothing fundamentally new that would result in the crown weakening . 
this is market dynamics . 
if you see a market moving in one way or the other you often forget the fundamentals and join the movement . 
he also said the market was thin and that small crown sales may have a major impact in such a situation . 
a broker noted that the crown had fallen through a series of technical support levels . 
while foreign investors were buying the petrocurrency at the beginning of the year , many now seem to want to get out of their positions , he said . 
&quot; This is flow-driven , and I reckon the stop-loss orders are pretty frequent , &quot; another player said . 
den Danske Bank predicted in its June report released last week that the Norwegian central bank would raise the deposit rate by 25 basis points between September 1997 and June 1998 to fight inflation pressure . 
a macro analyst doubted there would be an interest rate hike in the near future . 
&quot; If the central bank raises the rate many investors will put a lot of money in NOK , and then we will get an even stronger crown . 
the result would be high volatility and I don &apos;t think that is what the bank wants , &quot; he said .
