Federal Reserve policymakers are expected to end the year with a whimper , not a bang , by deciding to leave interest rates unchanged on Tuesday . 
in public speeches and private conservations in recent days , U.S. central bank officials have voiced broad satisfaction with the shape of the economy . 
while some are worried that stock prices may be too high and others fret that unemployment may be too low , none seem inclined to change rates at this time -- either up or down . 
&quot; The risks to the economy seem pretty evenly balanced , &quot; one official , who declined to be named , told Reuters . 
that is not the way it looked just a few months ago . 
at that time , the economy was coming off a strong second quarter and seemed on the verge of overheating . 
in fact , the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee came to the brink of raising interest rates in September , only to back off after central bank chairman Alan Greenspan argued for more time to see if the economy slowed down on its own . 
that indeed proved to be the case . 
economic growth slowed to an annualized rate of 2 percent in the third quarter from 4.7 percent in the second . 
consumer spending , which powered the economy forward in earlier this year , slowed abruptly in the third quarter . 
fed officials expect it to pick up in the run-up to the Christmas , but not enough to prove an inflationary threat . 
inflation , by most measures , has been trending down , they noted . 
after stripping out volatile food and energy costs , consumer prices rose by only 0.2 percent in November . 
the economic slowdown should allow the policymakers to adopt an even-handed policy directive at their meeting on Tuesday . 
that would be a shift from the stance of the late summer and early fall , when the FOMC tilted policy in the direction of higher rates , without actually raising them . 
the central bank has not changed short-term rates since January , when it shaved them by a quarter percentage point . 
that brought the federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans down to 5.25 percent and the discount rate the Fed charges the banks to 5 percent . 
but the steady stance does not mean that Fed policymakers , who are paid to worry about the economy , have no concerns . 
with stock prices high and unemployment low , there is a risk that the economy could pick up steam again next year , fanning inflation . 
the strong stock market means investors have more to spend , while the tight labour market points to higher wages and more spending power for workers . 
Greenspan warned earlier this month that the Fed needed to be wary when &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; infected stock and other asset markets because the subsequent crash could end up doing damage to the economy . 
some of the froth has gone out of the stock market since then , as investors have cashed in part of their profits , pushing equity prices lower . 
analysts doubt though that Greenspan and the Fed would raise interest rates merely to rein in the stock market , if only because that would risk triggering the very crash they are seeking to avoid . 
the tight jobs market is also unlikely to trigger a Fed rate increase unless it leads to a surge in wage demands by workers and a subsequent rise in inflation , they said . 
the unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in November , from 5.2 percent in October , easing some of the pressures in the labour market . 
but it is still somewhat below the 5.5 to 5.75 percent level that some Fed officials believe is sustainable on a long-term basis without spurring inflation .
