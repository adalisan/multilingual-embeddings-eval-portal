tight supplies and frigid winter weather in the central United States sent oil and gas prices soaring Thursday . 
grain , copper and lumber prices also rose . 
the Knight Ridder commodity Research Bureau index of 17 futures prices rose 0.61 point to close at 246.21 . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange crude oil prices set a new post-Gulf War high for a second straight day , with January crude closing up 41 cents a barrel at $ 26.57 . 
January natural gas futures rose 33.4 cents to close at $ 4.409 per 1,000 cubic feet . 
the contract high of $ 4.60 was set earlier this week . 
January heating oil , however , fell 0.40 cent a gallon to 73.78 cents as traders pared back earlier buying from this week as the freezing temperatures in the Midwest continued to skirt the Northeast , the largest U.S. heating oil market . 
heating oil stocks , still only about 94 percent of last year &apos;s level , have been growing . 
but not so with crude stocks . 
the American Petroleum Institute said this week that crude oil stocks as of Dec . 13 were 21.1 million barrels below a year ago after large stock drawdowns in recent weeks . 
traders noted active refiner buying in the cash markets on Thursday . 
Mexico &apos;s three main crude shipping ports remained closed Thursday as a cold front brought dangerously high waves and winds to the Gulf of Mexico , port officials said . 
&quot; The cash market is real strong . 
there &apos;s supply tightness in the January market while Iraqi crude is seen affecting the February contract , &quot; said Thomas Blakeslee , analyst with Cargill investor Services . 
Iraq said on Thursday it had signed oil export contracts with 23 companies . 
it is allowed to sell $ 2 billion worth of crude oil over six months to buy humanitarian supplies , the first international sales since the United Nations applied trade sanctions after Iraq &apos;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
ship brokers said two tankers of Iraqi crude have already loaded at the Middle East Gulf terminal of Mina al-Bakr destined for the United States and the Caribbean . 
January gasoline rose 0.05 cent a gallon to 71.22 cents on talk of scheduled maintenance at large refineries that will cut production . 
at the Chicago Board of Trade , corn and soybean markets rose on the back of strong exports . 
March corn closed up 1-1 / 4 cents a bushel at $ 2.66 , and January soybeans gained 3-3 / 4 cents to $ 7.07-3 / 4 . 
the Agriculture Department said Thursday U.S. net export sales of corn for the week ended Dec . 12 were 700,900 metric tons , roughly 200,000 tons above the previous week . 
cold weather in the Midwest also was boosting feed usage by the livestock , another supportive factor for corn . 
export demand also boosted soybeans , with weekly exports of 707,800 tons above expectations for 500,000 to 600,000 tons . 
the U.S. census Bureau also said soybean processors in November crushed 133 million bushels , above the 127 million crushed in October . 
&quot; The fundamentals supported us , it was up on the sales numbers this morning , &quot; said Ron Kucha of O &apos;Connor and Co . 
copper prices also rose on tight supplies , with March copper at the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange closing up 1.70 cents at 102.30 cents per pound . 
at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange lumber prices closed strong in thin volumes as talk of holiday closings at lumber mills spurred buying . 
January lumber closed up the $ 10 daily trading limit at $ 407.10 per thousand board feet . 
some traders called the rally overdone and cited weather factors that could slow or stop home construction . 
&quot; It &apos;s really hard to have a lot of lumber demand when it &apos;s 20 below zero and it &apos;s snowing in half the country , &quot; said Neil Schmaedick , Smith Barney Forest Products analyst .
