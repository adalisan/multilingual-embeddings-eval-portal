rise Down 
Q4 97 - 6 1st half 97 - 2 
1st half 98 - 2 
a rate cut in March is seen as a slim possibility following the RBA &apos;s statement in the February Bulletin that &quot; current monetary policy settings are broadly appropriate for the time being . 
the one factor in the near term that could change the rate outlook is the outcome of the Australian Council of Trade Union &apos;s ( ACTU ) &quot; living wage &quot; claim , economists said . 
while a better than expected result may lift the possibility of another rate cut , it would not make a cut a better than even money chance despite the favourable inflation outlook , because of the signs of strengthening economic activity . 
that outlook of stronger growth has led many to see the easing cycle as being over . 
most see the next most likely move in rates as being an increase in late 1997 or the first half of 1998 . 
of course , renewed weakness in activity data could see the outlook revised . 
the best chance for a rate cut is seen by mid-year . 
if it has happened by then , economists said the economy should be showing signs of strength that would rule one out .
