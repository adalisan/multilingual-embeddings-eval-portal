the Singapore rubber market was quiet by the midday break on Monday with the prospect of intervention by the International Natural Rubber Organisation ( INRO ) casting a shadow over the market , dealers said . 
&quot; Some suppliers were holding back because they &apos;re afraid INRO might come in . 
the other dealers were also wary about INRO although most feel they will not come in at this time . 
the net result is a very quiet market , &quot; one dealer said . 
the rubber trade has been waiting for INRO to intervene after its five-day indicator price slipped below the 183.00 cent level where it &apos; may-buy &apos; to support rubber prices . 
&quot; Some people are worried that INRO may step in suddenly , but that seems unlikely for now , &quot; a dealer said . 
major consumers were also sitting on the sidelines , waiting for the picture in the market to clear up . 
&quot; The big boys have stepped back from the market . 
it would be foolish to play a hero in this market , &quot; a trader said . 
at around 0445 GMT , September RSS3 was indicated at 92.75 U.S. cents a kg from 93.50 cents .
