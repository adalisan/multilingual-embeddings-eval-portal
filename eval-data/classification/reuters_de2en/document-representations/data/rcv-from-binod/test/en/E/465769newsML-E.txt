the Czech 1997 budget showed a 7.9 billion crown deficit to the beginning of this week , the CTK news agency said on Tuesday , quoting finance ministry data . 
it quoted a report by Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik to members of parliament which said revenue during the period totalled 99.6 billion crowns , while government spending totalled 107.5 billion crowns . 
the deficit grew from 6.7 billion crowns at the end of February . 
Kocarnik has said he expects the cabinet by early April to discuss his plan to cut almost all 1997 state spending by two percent across the board . 
the plan , amounting to 11 billion crowns , would exclude social support payments . 
the 1997 state budget was approved as balanced with both revenues and expenditures at 549.1 billion crowns , but the government has blamed a slowdown in the pace of economic growth and tax collection for the deficit . 
CTK quoted the Kocarnik report as saying there were signs of recovery in tax collection . 
last year &apos;s budget , originally approved as a balanced budget , ended with a 1.56 billion deficit , after three years of surpluses .
