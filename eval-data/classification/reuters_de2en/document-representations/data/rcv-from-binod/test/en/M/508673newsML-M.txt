world oil prices slipped back on Tuesday , as tension appeared to slacken in Iran &apos;s dispute with the European Union and fears grew of worsening over-supply in crude and product markets . 
the May futures contract for world benchmark crude Brent Blend closed at $ 17.96 a barrel on London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) , off sharply from yesterday &apos;s final price of $ 18.19 . 
brokers said the market felt there would be no escalation in the dispute between Iran , the world &apos;s third largest crude exporter , and the European Union . 
crude oil prices moved up on Monday partly on a weekend report in the Washington Post newspaper , attributed to U.S. and Arab officials , linking a top Iranian official to a group suspected of the 1996 bombing of a U.S. military compound in Saudi Arabia . 
that report came hard on the heels of a German court &apos;s ruling on Friday that Iranian leaders were behind the killing of Kurdish dissidents in Berlin . 
but oil brokers said they did not expect the European Union to mimic Washington &apos;s blanket ban on trade with Tehran . 
&quot; The Iran issue has to escalate a lot further before we start to see the oil markets paying too much relevance , &quot; one IPE trader said . 
&quot; As we know , a coordinated European action against Iran is not going to be something that will be easily pulled off , &quot; the broker said . 
&quot; I get the impression that the Iranian situation is already being pushed to the side ( in oil markets ) , &quot; he added . 
the market was focusing instead on predictions for weekly U.S. stocks data published by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) after the market closes on Tuesday . 
prices across the Atlantic were weaker on the expectation the data would show crude oil stocks rising in the U.S. by 3.5 million barrels in the week to April 11 . 
such figures would underline how far world crude production currently outstrips demand . 
the consequence has been a three-month 30 percent slide in price this year . 
however , some traders were still optimistic that the recent sharp drop in oil prices could be reversed . 
Kuwait &apos;s oil minister , ISA al-Mazeedi , told a London-based newspaper in an interview that he believed supply would continue high into the second quarter of the year but good demand for gasoline should keep prices steady . 
&quot; All indications are that the current production glut will continue in the second quarter of the year but because this period sees demand rising for light products ... and the industry begins to build stocks , these factors should minimise the impact on prices , &quot; Mazeedi told Asharq al-Awsat newspaper . 
&quot; You have to look at the United States as a big sponge that can absorb a lot of crude ... and the overhang that we saw for the last two weeks can easily be absorbed , &quot; one trader said .
