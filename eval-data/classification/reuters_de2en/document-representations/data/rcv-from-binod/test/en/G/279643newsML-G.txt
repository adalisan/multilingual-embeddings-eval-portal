Tibetans would continue to brave strong-arm tactics adopted by Chinese authorities in their quest for autonomy for their homeland , the Delhi office of Tibet &apos;s exiled spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , said on Sunday . 
Chinese authorities on Sunday blamed the Dalai Lama &apos;s supporters for a bomb explosion outside a government office in the Tibetan capital , Lhasa , and have condemned the blast as &quot; an appalling act of terrorism &quot; . 
&quot; Whenever they ( Chinese authorities ) have any problem they allege that a conspiracy has been plotted by Tibetan exiles and the Dalai Lama &apos;s group , &quot; Jampal Chosang , secretary in the Dalai Lama &apos;s Delhi office , told Reuters . 
&quot; The issue of Tibet will continue to be a major problem for China , if they ( Chinese officials ) do not negotiate with the Tibetan people , &quot; Chosang added . 
the bomb explosion on December 25 , the largest so far reported in Tibet , caused no casualties but resulted in widespread damage , local officials in Lhasa told Reuters in Beijing by phone . 
China routinely blames followers of the Dalai Lama , for anti-Chinese unrest that erupts sporadically in the strategic mountainous region that straddles the Himalayas and runs along China &apos;s sensitive border with India . 
&quot; The hardening of ( the ) position of Chinese authorities began from the beginning of April this year , &quot; Chosang said . 
&quot; They did not even allow families to hang pictures of Dalai Lama , &quot; he added . 
the Dalai Lama , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign to win autonomy for his homeland , says he wants self-government and freedom of worship in the deeply religious Buddhist region . 
he fled China in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Beijing rule . 
the Buddhist spiritual leader has lived in the north Indian town of Dharamsala since then . 
&quot; His holiness Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government in exile have been saying &apos; why not have negotiations with the Chinese leaders &apos; , &quot; Chosang said . 
&quot; China can continue to shoulder defence and foreign policies but allow Tibetans to have complete self-rule in internal matters like freedom of belief , promotion and preservation of culture , language and religion , &quot; he added . 
Chosang said that the Chinese authorities have so far not responded to the proposal made by Dalai Lama .
