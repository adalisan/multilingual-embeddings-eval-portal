-------------------------- ( June 26 ) ----------------------------

&quot; The market was sold down initially because of the Dow but there didn &apos;t seem to be any trend for the rest of the day , &quot; said Andrew Sekely , senior dealer at Sydney brokerage Intersuisse . 
Sekely said the market was mixed with as many stocks finishing up as down . 
he said investors were looking at a number of factors affecting the market at the current time , including the Dow , interest rates and commodity prices . 
&quot; The conventional wisdom is that you shouldn &apos;t be out of the market at the current time , &quot; he said adding the market had the potential to rise another 10 percent in the near term . 
the food sector outperformed the rest of the market with the food and household index gaining 1.7 percent on the day . 
strong performances from beverage group , Coca Cola Amatil and troubled food company Burns Philp were behind the rise .

the yield on 10-year T-bonds closed at 7.12 percent , up 0.07 percentage points from Wednesday &apos;s close . 
the Australian dollar offered every impression of being a fixed currency on Thursday , making no effort to escape the cramped US $ 0.7480 / 7530 range held all week .
