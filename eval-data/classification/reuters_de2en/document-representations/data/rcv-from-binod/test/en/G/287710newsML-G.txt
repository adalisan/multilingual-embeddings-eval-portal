Sri Lankan newspapers and free press activists on Sunday condemned government action against a television news executive as well as the alleged assault on a television crew by a deputy minister &apos;s bodyguards last week . 
&quot; We hope that the protests ... will make the goverment rethink its attitude , &quot; Lucien Rajakarunanayake , trustee of the Free Media Movement , told Reuters . 
the Movement said the government was trying to intimidate journalists by sending police to the private Telshan Network Ltd ( TNL ) to question two executives . 
Sri Lanka &apos;s editors &apos; Guild also condemned the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to question and detain a TNL news executive who was subsequently released on bail . 
criminal Investigation Department ( Cid ) detectives visited TNL at night and the executive was detained after the station broadcast an erroneous report of a Tamil Tiger rebel attack . 
the government denied the report . 
&quot; The government &apos;s antagonism towards the independent media appears to be turning into a phobia with some of them seeing journalists as terrorists , &quot; the Sunday Times newspaper said in an editorial . 
the Island newspaper said the government had yet to implement its promises to remove constitutional and legal constraints on the media after two years in power . 
&quot; Instead ... the most repressive of all enacted legislation , the Prevention of Terrorism Act , has now been resorted to by the government against the media , &quot; it said . 
the People &apos;s Alliance government won power in 1994 , making media freedom one of its main election campaign planks to end the United National Party &apos;s 17-year reign . 
the editors &apos; Guild said it deplored last Wednesday &apos;s alleged assault on the crew of a state-run television station by bodyguards of a deputy minister in a suburb north of Colombo . 
the crew were filming the burning of a truck , set on fire by angry residents after it struck a youth .
