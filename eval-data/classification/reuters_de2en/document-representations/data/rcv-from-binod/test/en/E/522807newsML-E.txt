Prime Minister Romano Prodi urged the Bank of Italy on Saturday to cut official interest rates because price rises have slowed . 
&quot; We will soon see the latest economic data , which will confirm the fall in inflation , a fact that could contribute to a reduction in the cost of money , &quot; Prodi told a rally of the centre-left government alliance in Milan ahead of local elections next weekend . 
reduction in the cost of money is not the task of government , but monetary adjustments could be prompted as a consequence of &quot; virtuous behaviour &quot; , he said in a speech reported by the domestic news agency Ansa . 
preliminary data from 11 Italian cities on April 21 and April 22 next week are set to show that Italy &apos;s consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in April , compared to 2.2 percent in March , and many analysts see this as a trigger for the Bank of Italy to trim its official discount rate . 
the Bank of Italy has cut its discount rate three times in the last 10 months , each time by 75 basis points , with the last reduction coming in January this year bringing the rate down to 6.75 percent from nine percent in early July 1996 . 
Italy &apos;s Treasury minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said earlier this week that he expected Italy &apos;s preliminary April CPI data to show an annual rate of 1.8 percent . 
the official data is published on May 6 .
