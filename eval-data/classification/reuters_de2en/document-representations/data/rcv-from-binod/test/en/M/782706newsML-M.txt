London stocks roared ahead by 1.2 percent to a new trading peak on Wednesday , smashing through 5,000 points on the FTSE index as a weaker pound boosted prospects for exporters . 
the dollar , in contrast , leapt to its highest level in eight years against the mark for the fourth consecutive trading day amid expectations the Bundesbank has limited scope to nudge interest rates higher in the mark &apos;s defence . 
most of the morning &apos;s excitement was in London , Europe &apos;s biggest bourse , where shares climbed to an intra-day peak of 5020.1 points , up 59.5 , on the back of strong company results and a sharp drop in sterling . 
&quot; Sterling has turned around against the mark and that has given a lift to everything , &quot; said the head of equity trading at one top investment bank . 
&quot; But volumes aren &apos;t high and the market feels very &apos; summery &apos; . 
the pound , which has soared on hopes of higher interest rates , dropped four pfennigs against the mark as sentiment went into reverse and expectations fell that the Bank of England would this week sanction a further rate rise . 
sterling was at 3.01 marks at mid-morning . 
&quot; The market is still very firm and the way sterling is performing is indicating that the market doesn &apos;t think there will be an interest rate hike , &quot; said another senior trader . 
many investors anxiously awaited a rate announcement 
expected on Thursday at the end of a two-day Bank of England monetary policy meeting . 
some said a quarter point interest rate rise was already built into stock prices and should not prove a major hurdle for shares to overcome . 
companies which export or which earn large revenues overseas benefited from the weaker pound . 
but some dealers said they had been taken aback by the London markets &apos;s strength . 
&quot; I feel uncomfortable with the market at these levels , &quot; said one . 
&quot; The problem is predicting when it will peak . 
stocks in the rest of Europe made healthy gains . 
Paris climbed nearly 1.5 percent by lunchtime in line with increases in the futures market . 
in Frankfurt , shares were up by 0.8 percent at midday although uncertainty remained over prospects for German credit as German jobless data argued against any rate hike . 
elsewhere in currencies , the dollar climbed one pfennig to 1.8887 marks as the latest German unemployment figures showed a higher-than-expected increase of 17,000 in July , fanning sentiment that the economic recovery was too fragile to allow the Bundesbank to raise rates too far . 
in addition , the central bank made a large injection of funds into the German money market on Wednesday in what dealers interpreted as a sign it did not want to raise short-term interest rates for the time being . 
&quot; The bottom line is that the Bundesbank &apos;s hands are tied , &quot; said Mark Geddes , treasury economist at ABN AMRO . 
&quot; It has threatened higher rates and if it fails to follow through , it will be the green light for fresh gains . 
dollar / mark looks like it could be trading at 1.90 next week . 
the Bundesbank has encouraged speculation that it will engineer higher money-market rates if mark weakness persists but this has failed to deter dollar bulls , who say the central bank cannot raise rates high enough to defend the mark in the face of economic fragility . 
&quot; The Bundesbank &apos;s barrels are empty in terms of what they can do to defend the currency , &quot; said Paul Lambert , senior currency strategist at UBS Ltd in London . 
against the yen , the dollar settled just below the 12-week high it set overnight after comments by a Japanese official reinforced expectations that interest rates there are not about to rise from record lows anytime soon . 
the dollar was at 1.8887 marks and 119.35 yen , compared to 1.8790 and 119.06 in late trading on Tuesday . 
gold was fixed at $ 318.85 an ounce , compared to $ 319.85 at the close on Tuesday . 
silver was six points lower at $ 4.34 .
