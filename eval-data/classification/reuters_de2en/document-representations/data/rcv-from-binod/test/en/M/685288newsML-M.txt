* Vilniaus Bank holds at 230.00 litas . 
* Hermis Bank stuck at 190.00 litas . 
* Rokishkis cheese advances to 42.00 litas from 41.10 litas . 
* brokers say indices staying steady as investors lose interest . 
major shares stayed steady in early trading on Wednesday , but brokers at Lithuania &apos;s bourse still held hopes of a slight increase in prices this week . 
&quot; Probably prices will be up , but I &apos;m in a modest mood about the market , &quot; said one broker . 
brokers said that this week &apos;s flagging central market activity was a sign that last week &apos;s mild recovery was coming to an end as several large issues had found reasonably liquid prices and would continue to stay put . 
blue chips Vilniaus Bank and Hermis Bank , which helped push up the market last week , were steady again today . 
Vilniaus Bank held at 230.00 litas while Hermis Bank was stuck at 190.00 litas . 
&quot; This is a fair price for Vilniaus Bank , &quot; said one broker . 
&quot; It could go back to 225.00 litas or 220.00 litas , but that would be a buying opportunity . 
brokers still say Hermis has more upward potential than its rival Vilniaus Bank but that it may have to wait until half-year results are announced before it vaults over 200.00 litas . 
brokers are also watching Rokishkis cheese , which advanced to 42.00 litas from 41.10 litas , and is expected to out-perform the market this year . 
brokers blamed yesterday &apos;s decline on a week market and say the share is correcting itself . 
some expect it to pass 55.00 litas if the market manages to revive in the autumn . 
Lithuanian Gas remained at a steady 1.60 litas and is another share brokers say has long-term potential .
