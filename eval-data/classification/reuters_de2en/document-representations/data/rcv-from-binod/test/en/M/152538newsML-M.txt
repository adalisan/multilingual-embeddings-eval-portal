about 6.1 million lbs of surplus U.S-owned cobalt will be offered for sale during fiscal 1997 through sealed bid and negotiated sales , the head of the Defense National stockpile Center said Wednesday . 
Congress has authorized the stockpile agency to sell up to 26 million lbs contained cobalt through FY2006 . 
eight other commodities also were approved for disposal over 10 years . 
stockpile administrator Richard Connelly announced the cobalt sales plan for FY97 in a speech in Pittsburgh . 
sealed bid sales will be offered in December , March and May . 
negotiated sales will be in February , April and September . 
approximately one million lbs will be offered each time . 
the February offering would be 1,100,000 lbs , the agency said . 
at each offering , about 250,000 lbs would be offered with 99-99.29 PCT contained cobalt , 250,000 lbs of 99.3-99.39 PCT contained cobalt , 250,000 lbs 99.4-99.49 PCT contained cobalt and 250,000 lbs of 99.5-99.59 PCT contained cobalt . 
Congress gave the agency a target of $ 81 million in sales in FY97 and $ 612 million over the 10-year period . 
both targets &quot; are easily achievable , &quot; Connelly said , without disrupting markets or being forced to sell during weak prices .

--Aluminum , 62,881 short tons . 
--Cobalt , 26,000,000 lbs .
