a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter jet disappeared over the Black Sea near the coast of the Crimean peninsula on Thursday , a navy official said . 
&quot; Our radars have not received any indication that it crashed , so we cannot exclude the possibility it was hijacked , &quot; the official , who asked not to be identified , told Reuters . 
&quot; Contact with the jet was lost at 1120 ( 0820 GMT ) on Thursday when it had just crossed the coastline , &quot; he said . 
six ethnic Russian pilots seized jets and flew from Ukraine to Russia in 1992 , after the two countries were separated by the break-up of the former Soviet Union . 
they were protesting at a ruling that all officers in the newly-created Ukrainian armed forces -- Russians and Ukrainians -- should take an oath of loyalty . 
low and irregularly paid wages , bad living conditions and widespread housing problems continue to cause tension in the 350,000-strong Ukrainian armed forces . 
a defence ministry spokesman in Kiev said several helicopters and special search planes were hunting for the missing fighter .
