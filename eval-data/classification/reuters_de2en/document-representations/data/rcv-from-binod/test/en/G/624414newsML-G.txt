a Senate committee announced on Wednesday that it will take up next week a proposal to modernize the Food and Drug Administration , speed up drug approval and renew a program under which drug makers pay fees to help get their products reviewed . 
aides to Sen. James Jeffords , a Vermont Republican and chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources committee , said the panel will start work on June 4 on the legislation he proposed to reform the FDA . 
as expected , the bill includes a proposal to renew for another five years the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 , in which the drug industry has paid some fees that the FDA has used to beef up its own resources to speed up drug approvals . 
Conservative Republicans last year made FDA reform a top priority but the issue has not been as contentious in recent months , partly because FDA commissioner David Kessler has resigned . 
no successor has been named . 
Jeffords , a moderate Republican , has said he hopes to modernize the agency , speed up drug approval , and concentrate agency resources on products that are genuinely high-risk . 
he is likely to encounter some opposition from liberals and consumer groups who fear that getting new products to the market too swiftly could create health hazards . 
the bill would also give the FDA greater discretion to approve a drug for additional purposes or for additional patient populations . 
once a drug is on the market , doctors may legally prescribe it for &quot; off-label &quot; use but insurers do not always pay for such prescriptions without specific FDA approval . 
Jeffords also hopes to expand access to unapproved or experimental drugs and devices to seriously ill people who have exhausted alternatives . 
the bill would clarify various procedures the FDA uses to approve or disapprove drugs and medical devices . 
it would also allow give manufacturers the go-ahead to use FDA approval in product labeling , which is now forbidden . 
even many congressional FDA critics have acknowledged that the agency has sped up drug approval times but is still not meeting the goals set in law . 
the Jeffords bill would require the agency to show how it would comply with those timeframes by 1999 . 
the bill would also give the FDA greater authority to contract with outside experts to review certain new technologies . 
the FDA would also have to expand its current pilot projects for outside review of medical devices by accredited outside experts . 
it would also create a program of regional drug research centers to look into new uses of medical products , and unforseen risks of products that have been approved for use . 
the bill , a summary of which was released Wednesday , would also try to improve communications between the agency and the medical device industry , so that the manufacturers know what type of safety studies are required . 
the FDA would have to respond 30 days after a meeting with the manufacturer . 
the agency would have to give a medical product manufacturer feedback during the review period , so that the approval process does not drag on and on . 
errors and problems could be addressed without having the whole approval process get bogged down unnecessarily . 
a manufacturer would not have to start the process from scratch if minor modifications were made .
