new York , Aug 22 - The dollar surged to a five-week high against the mark Thursday after Germany &apos;s central bank stunned currency traders by aggressively cutting a key interest rate , triggering a round of rate cuts in Europe . 
the Bundesbank &apos;s policy-setting council cut its securities repurchase rate , or repo rate , to 3 percent from 3.30 percent . 
the central bank left its discount and Lombard rates -- the floor and ceiling for German money market rates -- at 2.50 percent and 4.50 percent , respectively . 
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said a slowdown in German money supply growth and low inflation had allowed the central bank to cut its main money market rate . 
lower rates typically hurt the mark by making deposits denominated in the currency less attractive . 
&quot; Obviously , a repo cut was expected , but the size was completely unexpected , &quot; said Ben Strauss , assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co . 
&quot; To get 30 basis points on the repo was I guess a pleasant surprise for people that were ( positioned ) the right way , &quot; said Dennis Pettit , foreign exchange manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan in New York . 
there are 100 basis points in a percentage point . 
after the Bundesbank move , the dollar jumped and continued climbing to 1.4964 marks , its highest level since July 16 . 
but the rally ran out of steam as some investors took advantage of the move by selling dollars to book profits . 
&quot; It moved a good strong pfennig , &quot; said Diego Giurleo , vice president of the Treasury Department at Royal Bank of Canada in New York . 
&quot; They bought the dollar ( but the rally ) lost momentum above 1.4950 . 
&quot; There are 100 pfennigs to the mark . 
late in New York , the dollar settled at 1.4920 marks , up from 1.4825 marks late on Wednesday . 
the dollar fell to 108.20 Japanese yen from 108.45 yen . 
the mark &apos;s losses were broad-based as the currency also lost ground to the French franc , Italian lira , British pound , Spanish peseta and the yen . 
while currency traders applauded the Bundesbank &apos;s cut , concern about where German interest rates were headed from here may have helped limit the dollar &apos;s gains against the mark . 
&quot; I &apos;m just surprised that it didn &apos;t move over 1.50 ( marks ) because that &apos;s a very strong move by the Bundesbank , &quot; said Tom Benfer , director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal in New York . 
&quot; I think the market is now trying to grapple with the notion -- is this the last move of the Bundesbank or could there be further cuts in the future ? 
other European central banks cut rates after the Bundesbank , including banks in France , Austria , Belgium and the Netherlands . 
while the Swiss National Bank left its discount rate unchanged , it pumped liquidity into the Swiss money market in an effort to relieve upward pressure on money market rates . 
the dollar rose to 1.2074 Swiss francs from 1.2005 francs . 
the British pound ended unchanged at $ 1.5506 .
