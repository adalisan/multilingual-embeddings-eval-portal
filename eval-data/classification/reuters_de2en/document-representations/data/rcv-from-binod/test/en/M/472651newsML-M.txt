rubber prices rose slightly at the Colombo auction on Thursday as buyers eyed the drought-reduced quantity but did not rush to buy immediately , brokers and buyers said . 
&quot; There was very little rubber available , &quot; said a senior official for a leading Colombo exporter . 
&quot; People want the rubber , but at the same time they didn &apos;t want to upset price levels by rushing to buy . 
demand for the 157 tonnes on offer was low , with buyers hoping more quantities would arrive on the market in the coming weeks . 
best latex one-x , the purest grade , rose to 75.75 rupees per kilo from 75.65 on Tuesday , when the auction was last held , brokers John Keells said . 
RSS 1 steadied at 63.72 per kilo from 62.95 while number one dropped marginally to 74.90 from 75 on Tuesday , they said . 
&quot; The industry desperately needs rain now , &quot; said a broker . 
&quot; The drought has caused low rubber intakes and a lack of water in factories has cut down on processing . 
Sri Lanka is experiencing a drought after the November-March northeast monsoon failed for the second year in a row .
