pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong voiced outrage on Friday at China &apos;s moves to halt an anti-Japanese rally to be held in Beijing over a group of disputed islands . 
China has been reported to be putting pressure on activists in Beijing who planned a rally outside the Japanese embassy in the Chinese capital next week . 
a dozen representatives of Hong Kong &apos;s democracy camp led by Democratic Party legislator Albert Ho protested outside China &apos;s de facto embassy in the British colony and tried to hand in a petition urging China to allow the Beijing rally to go ahead . 
but staff at the mission , the Xinhua News Agency building , refused to receive the letter . 
more Hong Kong people joined the growing wave of protests in the region against Japan &apos;s claim to the islands , known as the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus in Japanese . 
a group of Hong Kong transport workers petitioned the United States and Japan on the issue of sovereignty over the isles . 
a group of 30 demonstrators condemned a comment from the White House that the United States did not recognise any particular claim of sovereignty over the islands . 
the uninhabited archipelago lies 300 km ( 190 miles ) west of Okinawa island and 200 km ( 125 miles ) east of Taiwan . 
the islands are subject to rival claims by Beijing , Taipei and Tokyo .
