the cold snap gripping Europe has killed at least 50 people in Bucharest , their bodies stacked in an overcrowded morgue , its director said on Friday . 
&quot; We have here the corpses of 31 unidentified people found frozen to death , &quot; Vladimir Belis said by telephone . 
&quot; They were homeless . 
there are another 20 identified people who suffered sudden deaths because of the cold . 
we have 120 corpses stacked in an area normally set aside for 40 . 
Belis said Bucharest cemeteries were refusing to bury the dead because the ground remained frozen by temperatures still hovering at minus 6 Celsius ( 21 Fahrenheit ) . 
a Bucharest police source confirmed most of those who had frozen to death were ill , poor and malnourished , with no identity papers . 
no new deaths were reported on Friday . 
nor were there any accurate statistics for the rest of the country of 23 million . 
temperatures in northern Romania plunged to minus 25 Celsius ( minus 13 Fahrenheit ) just after Christmas . 
homeless , beggars and &quot; street children &quot; are a common sight in Bucharest , sleeping in sewers , parks , derelict buildings or underground stations . 
the government asked city police last week to provide temporary shelters for the homeless . 
road , rail and air traffic was restored on major routes this week but the Transport Ministry said shipping on the River Danube remained disrupted by ice .
