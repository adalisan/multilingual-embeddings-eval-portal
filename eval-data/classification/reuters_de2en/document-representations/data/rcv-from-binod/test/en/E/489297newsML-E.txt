United States Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Saturday that U.S. long-term interest rates remain consistent with solid growth . 
Rubin also told Reuters Financial Television that there was no evidence that the U.S. stock market &apos;s recent fall will hurt the economy , and repeated that currencies should not be used as trade tools . 
referring to the rise in U.S. bond yields after Friday &apos;s release of the latest U.S. unemployment figures , Rubin said long-term rates in the United States were still consistent with solid growth . 
because the United States is tackling its budget deficit , &quot; there is no longer a deficit premium on long-term rates , &quot; that would keep them above levels otherwise justified by economic fundamentals . 
he said that there was no evidence that the recent fall in the U.S. stock market had affected the fundamental outlook of the economy . 
&quot; It would not affect my economic projection , &quot; he said . 
Rubin , who visited Tokyo before coming here for a meeting of to the Asia-Pacific finance ministers , denied that he had warned Japan against a resurgence of its trade surplus . 
&quot; We are not warning anyone , &quot; Rubin said , noting that Japanese policymakers themselves support that goal . 
he reiterated his opposition to the manipulation of currencies to try to solve trade problems . 
&quot; One does not approach these issues with currencies , &quot; he said . 
Rubin is in the Philippine resort island to attend the three-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) finance ministers &apos; forum , which ends Sunday .
