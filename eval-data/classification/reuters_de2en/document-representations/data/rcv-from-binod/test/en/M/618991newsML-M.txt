German shares extended Monday &apos;s dramatic gains to surge to fresh records in early trade on Tuesday , shrugging off a wobbly start by Bunds and cheered on by some well-received corporate earnings . 
although the rally ebbed in the first hour of trading , many dealers said the market appeared healthy and ripe for more gains in the short term . 
&quot; We need calm after the past two days , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; This is a healthy sign in a market , &quot; he added . 
the early push looked like sending the IBIS DAX over a key psychological threshold of 3,700 points for the first time ever , but the impetus flagged . 
&quot; We may not see 3,700 today but that it not the end of it , &quot; said a Stuttgart dealer . 
the outperformers of the day were steel group Thyssen AG and retailer Metro AG , both of which released better-than-expected profit figures in the morning . 
metro rose 3.8 percent to 184.30 marks after reporting its first group profit on ordinary activities of 1.1 billion marks . 
Thyssen hit a high of 404 marks before settling back to trade up 7.50 marks , or 1.9 percent , at 401 marks after it reported an 81 percent rise in first half pre-tax profit . 
&quot; Those were excellent numbers , not only from Thyssen but also from Metro , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; That was a real surprise and an added boost for the market in the morning . 
some dealers said they had been wrong footed by the gain in prices in early trade and expected to see a weaker trend prevailing through the day . 
&quot; This is no day for records , &quot; one Frankfurt dealer said . 
the fact that Bunds were weak argued against more gains for shares , the dealer added . 
moreover he said Monday &apos;s rally was largely due to a reweighting of institutional portfolios in favour of Germany and out of France after the surprising left wing victory in the first round of parliamentary elections .
