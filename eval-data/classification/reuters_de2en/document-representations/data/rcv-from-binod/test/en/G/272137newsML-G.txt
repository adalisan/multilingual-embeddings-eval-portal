Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Sunday Japan supported Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori &apos;s speech to Marxist rebels holding 340 hostages at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima . 
&quot; Japan supports President ( Alberto ) Fujimori &apos;s televised message to the nation , &quot; he told reporters . 
Hashimoto was speaking after talking by telephone with Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda who held his second meeting with the Peruvian leader in Lima . 
Hashomoto said he had &quot; instructed &quot; Ikeda to leave Lima for home at around 1400 GMT on Sunday . 
in a blunt speech broadcast on local television and radio late on Saturday , Fujimori said a non-violent &quot; way out &quot; would be possible if the rebels surrendered weapons and released their roughly 340 hostages . 
&quot; The proposal is concrete : that the captors surrender their weapons to a guarantor committee and that they allow the evacuation of all the hostages without exception , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In this way the possibility of force being used by the Peruvian state will be ruled out and from there , with all guarantees , a way out can be studied . 
the speech , which Fujimori read in a rapid , stern voice , was his first public statement since the crisis began on Tuesday when about 20 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels stormed an exclusive cocktail party at the residence . 
Japan &apos;s pledge of support followed a surprise admission by Tokyo on Friday that there remained differences between Tokyo and Lima over how to handle the hostage crisis . 
Ikeda flew to Lima on Thursday as Japan &apos;s on-the-spot advisor in the crisis , two days after Marxist rebels seized the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence during a party in honour of Emperor Akihito &apos;s 63rd birthday . 
during his stay in Lima , Ikeda held talks with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori , the son of Japanese immigrants , and Education Minister Domingo Palermo Cabrejos , who was acting as a negotiator for the release of the hundreds of people taken hostage . 
Ikeda also met diplomats and consoled relatives of the dozens of Japanese diplomats and Peruvian-Japanese citizens held by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) . 
the Japanese group is one of the biggest being held . 
after the second meeting with the Peruvian leader on Sunday , Ikeda said Tokyo fully backed Fujimori &apos;s tough speech to the Marxist rebels . 
&quot; Although I cannot comment on the specifics , the proposal as a whole is the appropriate solution to a peaceful resolution to the crisis and the preservation of the lives of the hostages , &quot; Ikeda told Japanese reporters in Peru .
