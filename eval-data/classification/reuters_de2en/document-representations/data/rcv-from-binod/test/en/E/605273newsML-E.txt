the Philippines &apos; US $ 1.25 billion Yankee bond could be launched sooner rather than later , according to Philippines &apos; president Fidel Ramos . 
&quot; It was cancelled because of very poor U.S. market conditions at the time , &quot; Ramos told reporters at a news conference in Hong Kong . 
&quot; Now we resume the roadshow for the Yankee bonds upon the recommendation of the governor of the central bank of the Philippines and I think he has already applied for travel authority to go back to the U.S. so that he can kick it off , &quot; Ramos said . 
the bond is intended as a benchmark issue for the Philippines , which is working hard to build its capital markets and finance an aggressive programme of infrastructure development . 
but its planned launch in early April was delayed when interest rate action in the United States caused some short-term market instability . 
Central bank governor Gabriel Singson said earlier on Thursday that he had &quot; the luxury of time &quot; in deciding the launch date , and that he was watching markets closely day by day . 
the U.S. long bond yield was at about 6.50 percent for a spread of about 160 basis points at the original launch date , he said , but exactly similar conditions were not necessary to justify a new launch date . 
the Securities and Exchange Commission registration is valid for nine months , and everything is in place to allow the central bank to move swiftly as soon as markets conditions warrant , Singson said .
