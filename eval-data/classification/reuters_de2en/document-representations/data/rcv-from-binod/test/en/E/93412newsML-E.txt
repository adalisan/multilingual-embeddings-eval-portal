a top Polish central bank official said on Thursday that the bank wanted real interest rates to rise to keep credit action in check and protect the balance of payments from a potential imports boom . 
national Bank of Poland ( NBP ) president Witold Kozinski told a news conference the bank was worried that the fast growth in consumer credit since the start of the year would boost money supply and boost inflation . 
he said growing internal demand , signalled by the credit rise , would probably boost imports and widen an expected 1997 trade gap . 
Poland &apos;s current account balance of payments , which has long showed a confortable surplus thanks to cross-border trade , is now in rough balance , he said . 
&quot; Such fast credit growth ... is a signal of strong internal demand , which has to be cooled down . 
we expect a trade deficit in 1997 but we need to keep real rates rising ... to prevent the trade gap from becoming a record high , &quot; he said . 
consumer credit grew 64.5 percent since the start of the year , against corporate credit growth of 19.5 percent in that period and a deposits growth of 31.0 percent and 7.8 percent respectively . 
Kozinski said the NBP had yet to decide whether it would achieve its goal of higher real interest rates by keeping its key discount and Lombard rates fixed at the current level of 22 and 25 percent respectively or by making sure that they were reduced more slowly than inflation . 
&quot; There are two strategies : we can keep nominal rates flat amid falling inflation or reduce nominal rates slower than inflation , &quot; Kozinski said . 
the NBP called a news conference after newspapers quoted its head Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz as saying in Washington on Wednesday that a consumer credit boom this year might lead to a banking crisis and higher rates . 
Kozinski said that while the central bank was concerned with fast credit growth this year , so far there was no threat of a banking crisis in Poland . 
he said Gronkiewicz-Waltz remarks should be considered as more general comments on risks of too speedy credit expansion . 
&quot; In foreseeable time there will be no increase of nominal rates there are no reasons for the NBP to raise nominal rates , but the bank will want to keep real rates rising , &quot; he said . 
Kozinski said the central bank estimated year-on-year inflation in September should fall to about 19 percent from 20.5 percent in August and should not exceed 18 percent at the end of the year , down from 21.6 percent in December 1995 .
