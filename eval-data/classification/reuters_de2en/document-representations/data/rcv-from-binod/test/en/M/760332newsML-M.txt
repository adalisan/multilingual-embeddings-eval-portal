the cut-off yield of 10.85 percent at Monday &apos;s auction of four-year government bond was in line with market expectations and was already quoted at a premium , money market dealers said . 
&quot; The yield is not below expectations , &quot; said a dealer at a leading foreign bank in Bombay . 
&quot; There are offer quotes at 101 rupees for the new paper . 
&quot; I would call it a market-neutral cut-off , &quot; said the manager ( money markets ) at another bank . 
he said the new paper would trade at premium after the market opens on Tuesday . 
the Reserve Bank of India announced a cut-off yield of 10.85 percent at an auction of four-year bond to raise 50 billion rupees late on Monday . 
the issue was fully subscribed . 
&quot; The only thing holding the market tomorrow would be the call rates , &quot; he said , referring to expectations of a spurt in call rates following the flow of 50.0 billion rupees raised at Monday &apos;s auction . 
dealers expect a realignment of securities &apos; prices on Tuesday . 
&quot; You will see some sell-off in four-year paper and buying in three-year paper tomorrow , &quot; a dealer at a major bank said . 
&quot; For a 50-billion-rupee paper , you saw bids for over 110 billion -- it shows what the market thinks of liquidity -- it &apos;s easy , easy all the way . 
Indian banks have been wallowing in excess liquidity in recent months , most of which found its way into securities .
