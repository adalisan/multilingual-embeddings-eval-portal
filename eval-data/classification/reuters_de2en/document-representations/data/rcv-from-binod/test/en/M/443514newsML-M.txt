copper drifted higher on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) on Friday boosted by an inventory decline , but showed no sign of breaking out of the recent price range , traders said . 
volumes were thin and the market appeared squeamish of moving into new territory ahead of the weekend . 
three months copper ended the morning kerb at $ 2,356 per tonne , up $ 17 from Thursday &apos;s kerb close . 
but traders said it could still re-test the nearby $ 2,310 support level , from which prices bounced on Thursday . 
on the upside $ 2,375 was offering resistance . 
cash / threes backwardation flared slightly with the three months price to $ 58 / $ 60 , up about $ 5 from Thursday . 
aluminium was little changed , holding just above the $ 1,650 support level of the past two weeks , where long speculative positions were said to lurk , along with active consumer interest . 
on the upside trade selling was capping the market at around $ 1,690 / $ 1,700 , traders said . 
it finished at $ 1,655 , compared to $ 1,658 on Thursday . 
zinc , which made good upside progress this week , was solidly underpinned by a 3,425-tonne stock drawdown and held onto most of its gains . 
it ended $ 2 fimer at $ 1,282 , just $ 5 away from Thursday &apos;s fresh 4-1 / 2 year high . 
&quot; zinc looks good from a fundmental perspective and it &apos;s getting good interest . 
frankly it could ease back to $ 1,230 before I would start thinking about getting worried , &quot; a trader said . 
lead meanwhile was quieter and was last indicated at $ 688 / $ 690 , down $ 5 . 
the $ 700 level remained a viable target for lead , but prices needed to stay above $ 685 in order to avoid a sell-off , traders said . 
nickel was little changed at $ 8,085 , up $ 25 from Thursday and well within its recent $ 8,000- $ 8,110 range . 
the market ignored news that the chairman of Russia &apos;s Norilsk nickel group said he did not think the plant would strike . 
Union leaders plan strikes on March 27 and April 2 over wage and vacation arrears . 
tin similarly edged up $ 10 to $ 6,060 . 
Alloy was indicated little changed at $ 1,545 / 50 , up about $ 5 .
