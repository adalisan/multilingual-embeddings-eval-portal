NWE naphtha prices were weaker with crude on Monday , but traders said the market looked better balanced with all of the November Algerian cargoes placed . 
three of the 50,000 to 60,000 tonne cargoes had been taken up by petrochemical users while the third was in the hands of Brazil &apos;s Petrobras and will probably go transatlantic . 
&quot; There &apos;s not a great deal of demand , most players are now covered , and the market looks better balanced , &quot; trader said . 
traders saw pockets of top-up demand for paraffinic grades but expected prices to continued to drift lower with crude .
