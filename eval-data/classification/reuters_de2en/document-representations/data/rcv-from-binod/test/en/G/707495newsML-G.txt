most Chinese have come to accept the idea of lovers living together before marriage , a practice traditionally regarded as degenerate , the China Economic Times on Friday quoted a survey as showing . 
the survey , conducted by Beijing University &apos;s sociological Research Institute , interviewed 1,000 people from all walks of life about a practice that has in the past been a target of criticism by both the government and society , the newspaper said . 
the survey found that 59.4 percent of people interviewed said they could accept unwed couples living together , with women showing extra tolerance , the newspaper said . 
the newspaper story was illustrated by a picture of two foreigners kissing on a motorcycle . 
only 18.3 percent of those surveyed said they thought that the increasingly prevalent practice was the result of limited living space and financial difficulties and not romance , it said . 
some 47 percent said they thought cohabitation gave the partners involved more freedom and choice in relationships , but 65.6 percent said they still thought it was better for couples to get married before living together . 
Chinese officials have in the past sought to stamp out cohabitation by imposing fines on lovers caught living together , but the practice has grown in popularity as nearly two decades of economic reform erode once-strict communist social controls .
