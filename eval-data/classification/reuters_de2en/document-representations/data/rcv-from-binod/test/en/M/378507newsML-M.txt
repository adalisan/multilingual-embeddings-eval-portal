CSCE world sugar futures ended firmer Friday amid steady options-linked buying , but a round of speculative liquidation knocked the market off its highs ahead of the close , dealers said . 
today &apos;s expiry of March options set the tone early in the day , as speculators sold March calls against spot futures . 
dealers also noted steady shortcovering ahead of the holiday weekend in the U.S. 
after the initial climb , March futures pushed through nearby resistance at 10.75 cents a pound , and then filled a chart gap dating from mid-January at 10.84-10.85 . 
&quot; Options got it jump-started , and then shortcovering and fresh longs pushed it to the highs , &quot; said one broker . 
&quot; But after it closed the gap , the selling just got better and better . 
as the buying momentum thinned , locals scrambled to liquidate before the closing bell , he said . 
March closed up 0.14 cent at 10.78 cents after ranging from 10.61 to 10.86 . 
good fund buying was noted on second-position May , which gained 0.13 cent to close at 10.74 .
