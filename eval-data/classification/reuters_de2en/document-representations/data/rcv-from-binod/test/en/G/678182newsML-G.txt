the Florida Marlins put outfielder Cliff Floyd back on the disabled list Saturday with a pulled left hamstring . 
Floyd aggravated the injury running out a ground ball in Friday &apos;s 2-1 win over the Montreal Expos . 
it is the same injury that landed him on the disabled list from May 9 to 24 . 
Floyd , acquired from the Expos just before the start of the season , is hitting only .221 with two homers and five RBI in 38 games . 
the 24-year-old has already fought his way back from a serious injury to his left wrist suffered in May 1995 . 
the Marlins replaced Floyd on the roster by recalling outfielder Billy McMillon from Charlotte of the International League ( AAA ) .
