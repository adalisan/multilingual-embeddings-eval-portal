prices at the Kenya coffee auction dropped on Tuesday due to a lower quality of coffee on offer , auction officials said . 
grade ABS averaged $ 139 per 50-kg bag against $ 148 , grade AAs averaged $ 144 while grade Cs averaged $ 133 versus $ 140 . 
&quot; The quality of coffee on offer was not so good and there was no pressure by exporters to cover their short positions , &quot; a trader said . 
the Coffee Board of Kenya said it sold all 22,580 60-kg bags of coffee it had on offer compared with 21,038 sold last week .
