the people of Geneva will vote on the fate of a controversial seven-tonne marble sculpture in the heart of the lakeside city of a couple kissing which municipal officials want removed , Swiss news agency ATS said on Tuesday . 
Geneva &apos;s parliament , which wanted the sculpture removed because it had been erected without permission , ruled on Tuesday to hold a popular vote following public pressure , it added . 
the &quot; kiss &quot; was erected on an embankment on the shores of Lake Geneva by Swiss sculptor Vincent Kesselring without permission in 1995 and presented to the canton of Geneva . 
but the municipality rejected it , fearing it might create a precedent for other unauthorised sculptures . 
there are few nations that so readily and frequently vote as the Swiss , who can have any issue put to the vote if they can scrape together enough signatures . 
the 26 cantons of the Swiss Federation each make their own decisions on issues ranging from taxes to education in a powerful direct-voting system .
