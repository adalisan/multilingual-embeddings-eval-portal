after a busy time last week the data flow quietens down this week with the early tone being set by the reaction to Friday &apos;s U.S. payrolls data , and local payroll data moving to center stage later in the week . 
Friday &apos;s payrolls data showing a 339,000 rise in non-farm jobs was well above the average forecast of a 230,000 rise . 
however , wages growth remained well under control and the mixed message was a relief to markets which had prepared for the worst . 
treasuries and stocks rallied as it remained unclear whether higher U.S. rates would following the March 25 FOMC meeting , and their stronger closes should see local market open the week here with a firmer tone . 
locally , Monday starts off with a holiday in the state of Victoria , which delays the release of the ANZ job advertisement series for February until Tuesday . 
January manufacturing output prices and March consumer sentiment are due out on Wednesday , but Thursday is the big day for data with the February labour force report and January housing finance statistics due . 
&quot; They should simply confirm that the economy is well and truly on the way back up , although this in itself should stop any credit market bullishness re-emerging , &quot; Commonwealth Bank economist Tim Moloney said of the data . 
the labour market is expected to repeat its pattern of the last four months -- one of employment growing , but at an insufficient pace to make any inroads into unemployment . 
with the factoring out by markets of expectations of another rate cut , the anitcipation surrounding the jobs data over the last six months or so has also dissapated somewhat , although they are seen important in supporting the expectations of 
stronger growth in 1997 . 
strength in partial indicators has been one of the key factors in the changing sentiment on the rates outlook , and the housing finance data is also expected to continue that trend . 
if the median forecast of a 4.0 percent rise is met , it would see housing back at levels last seen 2 1 / 2 years ago , and be consistent with the signs of upturn seen in building approvals , economists said . 
the bond market will start the week on a reasonably positive note , having rallied in SYCOM on Friday after the U.S. market strengthened on the payrolls data . 
bonds had been under pressure ahead of the pressure with long bond futures falling almost 17 points , but the U.S. shortcovering saw them regain nine points in SYCOM . 
many analysts see the recent weaker trend as grossly overdone considering the benign inflation outlook , which was confirmed in last week &apos;s fourth quarter GDP report , and any further weakness is expected to prove to be buying opportunities . 
&quot; The market is jumping at growth shadows despite the favourable inflation outlook and amplifying any sell-off in the U.S. , &quot; ANZ Treasury economists said in a commentary , adding that the local bond market had been the worst performer this year with yields higher than in any industrial country at present . 
Australia &apos;s own labour force report will be the key point for the local market , more so after last week &apos;s strong data for retail trade and building approvals , which is seen pointing to a more vibrant March quarter after the soft patch late last year . 
a strong data outcome is expected to put further pressure on a market that has already priced in a 75 basis point tightening by the end year . 
the Australian dollar should start on a solid uptrend after gaining almost 1-1 / 2 cents last week as offshore investors rediscovered an appetite for the high yielding currency . 
the unit was again capped at US $ 0.7900 in offshore trade , but the combination of diminishing fears of another domestic rate cut , rising money market rates and an upbeat outlook for world commodity prices courtesy of strong U.S. growth should see it testing the upside . 
dealers expected stiff resistance at last week &apos;s US $ 0.7912 high , but if that could be broken a rally to US $ 0.7960 was on the cards . 
the stronger finish on Wall Street bodes well for local investors who had been nervous and non-commital ahead of the U.S. employment and wages data . 
however , any upbeat tone early in the week will likely be tempered by the absence of Victorian traders on Monday as they sleep off the effects of the Grand Prix weekend . 
the corporate reporting season enters the home straight with brokers saying profits are still the main focus of attention as the market awaits those still to come and analyses those already reported . 
&quot; The results do help to sort the wheat from the chaff , &quot; said head of equities at Intersuisse , Andrew Sekely , adding that investors now appeared to be much more responsive to a a good or bad result than has possibly been the case previously . 
&quot; watching these results just brings home to you that there is no such thing really as a long term investment . 
to run a portfolio you have to be pretty swift on your feet unless you are prepared to overlook the fluctuations . 
entering the last leg of the profit season-it ends March 14- several larger companies are scheduled to report . 
Metway Bank half year 
Tue : Ashton Mining full year 
Davids half year 
wed : Santos full year 
David Jones half year 
Delta Gold half year 
Thu : Coles Myer half year 
Gibson Chemical half year 
Fri : nil major scheduled at this stage . 
on the economic data front , the pick of the week is the local labour force report for February and January housing finance , both on Thursday , although any hopes for further interest rate cuts appear to be just that , rather than serious expectations at this stage .
