Mexican stocks rebounded from a midsession bout of profit-taking to close slightly higher Monday in a session dulled by a lack of foreign investors , traders and analysts said . 
the leading IPC share index closed up 6.43 points , or 0.17 percent , at 3,739.59 . 
volume totalled 102.3 million shares , but traders noted about one-third were in unrepresentative cross trades . 
traders said volume was below many recent sessions as U.S. markets were partly closed for the holiday commemorating slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . 
&quot; The market was very dull . 
you could tell there were few foreign investors ... 
I think we &apos;ll see more intraday profit-taking for the market to gather strength , &quot; said a trader from the Bursamex brokerage . 
the IPC dipped to a midsession low of 3,708.76 on what traders said was profit-taking . 
nonetheless , traders said a late recovery in the Dow Jones industrial average , which ended up 10.77 points to 6,843.87 points , was not the driving force behind a similar move in Mexico . 
&quot; The Dow Jones helped us because it enhanced confidence , but it was not the main reason , &quot; a trader said . 
on the broad market , 113 stocks changed hands , with gainers outnumbering losers by 55 to 32 . 
traders said the gainers &apos; list was headed by relatively illiquid stocks that had lagged behind the recent market rally , like autoparts maker Isasa and publishers Gfesa , which ended up 3 centavos ( 1 cent ) and 19 centavos ( 2 cents ) , respectively , at 32 centavos ( 4 cents ) and 2.03 pesos ( 26 cents ) . 
another leading gainer was technology firm Acerla , up 1.90 pesos ( 24 cents ) to 29.40 pesos ( $ 3.77 ) . 
dealers said Acerla was bolstered by the announcement it had signed a letter of agreement to buy a Brazilian computer manufacturer and distributor . 
financial group Banacci and mining firm Autlan headed the sliders after declining 62 centavos ( 8 cents ) and 30 centavos ( 4 cents ) , respectively , at 15.80 ( $ 2.02 ) and 8.60 pesos ( $ 1.10 ) on profit-taking , dealers said .
