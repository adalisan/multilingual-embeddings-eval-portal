French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn &apos;s predictions of a deficit well above 3.0 percent of GDP in 1997 are based on expectations of a shortfall in tax revenue and other state income and a fall in the unemployment benefit fund &apos;s surplus , minutes of a Wednesday meeting show . 
the minutes of Strauss-Kahn &apos;s closed-door address to the National Assmebly &apos;s finance committee spell out the factors , many of which have already been described by the new left-wing government and others . 
the minutes report him as saying that a 0.42 percent fall in contributions to the unemployment benefit fund UNEDIC would wipe out a 10-billion-franc UNEDIC surplus which had been included in the previous government &apos;s 1997 budget and deficit calculations . 
Strauss-Kahn also said that the 1997 budget had predicted a 3.3 percent rise in welfare contributions , which was more than could be counted on , and that revenues could fall six or seven billion francs short of expectations . 
the previous centre-right government forecast a social security deficit of 30 billion in 1997 in its initial budget law but later acknowledged that the deficit could come in above 35 billion . 
Strauss-Kahn was reported as telling the committee that the previous centre-right government &apos;s forecasts for value-added tax revenues had been overly optimistic , even taking account of the 1997 budget &apos;s predictions on economic growth -- a rise of 2.3 percent in GDP in 1997 . 
the minutes also reported him as saying some spending plans appeared to have been underestimated or insuffiicently provisioned . 
this belief would have to await the audit on public finances , due on July 21 , for confirmation . 
the previous government had insisted right up to the June 1 election when it lost power that it was on course to meet its target of reducing the deficit to 3.0 percent of GDP . 
Strauss-Kahn told reporters these factors undermined the logic of a repeat this year of the public deficit declines of previous years , from 5.6 percent of GDP in 1993 to 4.8 percent in 1994 and to 4.2 percent in 1996 . 
the previous government had been counting on a central government deficit of 3.4 percent , a social security deficit representing about 0.3 percentage points and a local government surplus worth 0.2 percentage points -- giving a net public deficit of 3.5 percent -- he was reported as saying . 
the rest would have been compensated by the transfer of pension funds from France Telecom which has now been completed and would bring the public deficit to around 3.0 percent of GDP . 
the minutes said Strauss-Kahn told the committee that despite the France Telecom money -- 37.5 billion francs -- the public deficit was unlikely to match the previous government &apos;s predictions due to the tax and social security contribution shortfalls , the fall in the unemployment fund surplus and the possible failure on spending control . 
the minutes said Strauss-Kahn told the committee that if the audit of finances showed &quot; massive slippage &quot; , the government would ensure that the deficit did not worsen but at the same time not impose an austerity plan which would weigh again on households . 
the UNEDIC fund said on Wednesday that it expected its cumulative surplus to come in at 996 million francs in 1997 , down sharply from the 10.3 billion surplus at the end of 1996 .
