China &apos;s police have recaptured 23,000 escaped prisoners since March and solved tens of thousands of cases in their latest campaign to stamp out soaring crime , the official Xinhua news agency said on Friday . 
in the &quot; Spring rectification Mission &quot; , police cracked 440,000 crimes , uncovered 131 organised crime gangs and closed 14,000 illegal dance halls , video-game centres , and sauna and massage parlours that served as fronts for illicit activities such as prostitution , it said . 
the Spring Mission is the latest round in China &apos;s nationwide &quot; Strike Hard &quot; campaign to eradicate crime , which was launched in April last year . 
police have confiscated 119,000 illegal guns since March and recovered property and money valued at 160 million yuan ( $ 19.3 million ) , Xinhua said , quoting the ministry of public security . 
the latest drive has targeted drugs and organised crime , as well as smuggling and lax border control in the southern province of Guangdong , which borders Hong Kong , the ministry said . 
the ministry issued a circular recently ordering all police nationwide to &quot; maintain an enthusiastic fighting spirit &quot; to ensure no untoward event mars the smooth handover of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty from Britain at midnight on June 30 , Xinhua said . 
Chinese leaders are determined to prevent social unrest , dissent , crime or accidents from spoiling the image of a patriotic triumph that has been whipped up by Beijing &apos;s propaganda tsars to surround the Hong Kong handover . 
State media have announced nearly 100 executions in the last few days across China in a crackdown on drug traffickers , many of them smuggling heroin from Southeast Asia &apos;s Golden Triangle and through Hong Kong to the United States and Europe . 
China is reported to have executed thousands of people , and possibly many more , since launching the &quot; Strike Hard &quot; campaign last year .
