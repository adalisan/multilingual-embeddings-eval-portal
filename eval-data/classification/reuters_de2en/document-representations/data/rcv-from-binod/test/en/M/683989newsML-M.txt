Brady bond prices were narrowly mixed on low volume on Tuesday as market participants awaited the June U.S. consumer confidence report due out later today , emerging market debt experts said . 
&quot; The markets have been incredibly quiet , &quot; said one emerging market debt source , who noted there had been only minimal buying following a decline in Brady prices on Monday . 
&quot; There is limited strength though nothing really substantial . 
&quot; Russian dollar Vneshekonombank loans RUVNUSLNS = RR , which reached record highs of 92-7 / 8 on Monday following news Russia had been admitted to the Paris Club , were 1 / 2 higher at 92-1 / 8 . 
traders said activity remained thin as investors awaited further direction from the U.S. Treasury and stock markets , which suffered sharp losses on Monday following comments from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto about the potential sale of U.S. government securities . 
in addition , they said the market will be focusing on the U.S. economic reports this week which include consumer confidence today at 1000 EDT / 1400 GMT , U.S. durable goods on Wednesday and first quarter Gross domestic product on Friday . 
&quot; The numbers this week are generally the set of numbers that have been pointing toward strength in the economy ... but the numbers this week may be if anything the ones that could upset the market , &quot; said a Brady trader at a U.S. investment bank .
