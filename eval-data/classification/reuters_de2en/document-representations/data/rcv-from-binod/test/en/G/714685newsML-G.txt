Australian race row politician Pauline Hanson vowed on Tuesday to continue rallying support for her One Nation party , despite a violent confrontation between protesters and her supporters which left several people injured . 
Hanson said that those who attacked her party &apos;s meeting in the rural town of Dandenong outside Melbourne on Monday night were &quot; political terrorists &quot; and that she would not back down . 
&quot; It is getting worse , &quot; Hanson said in a television interview as around 2,000 people gathered in Canberra to protest against her anti-immigration stance . 
&quot; All they are , are political terrorists . 
I never wanted it ( the violence ) , but it makes me more determined , and people around me are more determined , that we have to stop this sort of growing violence that is happening in Australia . 
&quot; You must to stand up for your rights . 
asked did she fear someone may be killed at a One Nation rally , Hanson said : &quot; Yes , but are we going to live in fear for the rest of our lives ? 
up to 1,500 protesters disrupted the One Nation meeting on Monday , attended by 150 Hanson supporters but not by Hanson . 
police said a small militant group of protesters , some wearing balaclavas , threw potatoes , eggs and urine-filled balloons at Hanson supporters . 
but protest organiser Peter Jolly said the protest was peaceful until police and One Nation bodyguards moved into the crowd . 
&quot; We are not in favour of rioting and bashing . 
we say it is One Nation which started that last night , &quot; Jolly said . 
a former Australian deputy prime minister , 82-year-old Jim Cairns , joined in the protests but was thrown out of the meeting after he started distributing anti-Hanson tracts . 
police said several people were injured , including a 60-year-old man attending the meeting who was taken to hospital with head injuries after a scuffle . 
seven arrests were made . 
police said they would tighten up security at a country rally to be attended by Hanson next week in Geelong . 
in Canberra , about 2,000 noisy protesters gathered outside One Nation &apos;s first official meeting in the Australian capital . 
demonstrators chanted anti-Hanson slogans and jostled periodically with police as Hanson supporters arrived but there was no repeat of Monday &apos;s violence . 
a red swastika was beamed by a spotlight across the front of the National Press Club , venue for the One Nation meeting . 
Hanson did not attend the meeting . 
one Nation , which has an anti-immigration platform and also campaigns against Aboriginal welfare , has attracted support away from Australia &apos;s main political parties to become the country &apos;s third political force . 
an opinion poll on Tuesday showed six-percent support for the independent politician and her party , which wasonly officially registered last month . 
Hanson is the only elected member of her party , which has yet to be tested at an election .
