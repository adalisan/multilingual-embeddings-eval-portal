Colombians have long bridled at their country &apos;s bad image abroad , and they were angered by Friday &apos;s announcement that Washington decided to &quot; decertify &quot; Colombia for the second year as an ally in the war on drugs . 
some see a perverse sense of justice in the decision to keep Latin America &apos;s oldest democracy on a blacklist -- along with Afghanistan , Burma , Iran , Nigeria and Syria . 
it prompted government officials to warn that Colombia may downgrade its relations with Washington because of its effort to play the role of world policeman . 
but government critics say decertification was at least consistent with U.S. policy toward President Ernesto Samper , who Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard called a &quot; truly corrupt president &quot; in recent testimony on Capitol Hill . 
&quot; I see the justice of the decision when you look at it as a sanction against Samper ; I consider it just from that point of view , &quot; said Enrique Parejo , a former justice minister and anti-drug crusader who narrowly escaped assassination by a Medellin cartel gunman in January 1987 . 
government officials have quietly expressed disgust at the fact that Mexico -- a country rocked by numerous drug corruption scandals and the recent downfall of anti-drug Czar Gen. Jesus Rebollo -- won the U.S. certification that was denied to Colombia . 
but Parejo , who says drug corruption has had a corrosive effect on all aspects of life in Colombia , said he sees an important difference between the Andean nation and Mexico . 
&quot; As soon as they discovered the anti-drug Czar was linked to drug trafficking they got rid of him , &quot; Parejo told Reuters . 
&quot; Here , meanwhile , we discovered and proved up to the hilt that Samper financed his run for the presidency with drug money and Samper is still president , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The Colombian people haven &apos;t been capable of getting him out of the presidency , and that involves us all in a moral problem . 
Samper was absolved by Congress in June 1996 -- three months after Colombia &apos;s first decertification -- of charges that he knowingly received millions of dollars in drug money to finance his 1994 campaign . 
most Colombians seem to agree that his allegedly drug-financed campaign was the main reason for the country &apos;s renewed decertification , however . 
the U.S. State Department referred to his congressional trial in a statement on Friday as &quot; a process which can only be described as flawed . 
the same statement praised Colombia &apos;s police and military for efforts to crack down on the drug trade . 
but it stressed that Samper had &quot; failed to take concrete steps to combat the drug interests that funded his political campaign . 
the statement , and other comments by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright referring to corruption at the &quot; highest levels &quot; of Samper &apos;s government , prompted Colombia &apos;s attorney general to fire off a letter to the U.S. embassy demanding hard evidence to back up the U.S. allegations . 
the State Department also said that Colombia , which produces three quarters of the world &apos;s cocaine , was the source of 62 percent of the heroin being seized on U.S. streets and a growing producer of coca , the raw material for cocaine . 
Samper argued , in a heated interview with CNN &apos;s Spanish- language affiliate on Friday night , that &quot; anti-drug policy has failed &quot; because of what he called &quot; the frankly distressing levels of growth in ( drug ) consumption in the United States . 
&quot; What we have here is a marketing problem . 
if there &apos;s supply , which we of course are responsible for and have to fight , it &apos;s because there &apos;s demand , &quot; he said . 
for now , however , Colombians might be thinking of something Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez said in a speech in July 1994 , just before a U.S. drug agent publicly branded Colombia a &quot; narco-democracy . 
&quot; The bad image of the country abroad angers us , &quot; Garcia Marquez said . 
&quot; But we don &apos;t dare to admit that the reality is worse .
