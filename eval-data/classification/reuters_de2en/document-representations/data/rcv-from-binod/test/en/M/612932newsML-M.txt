indices : 
* Government bonds general : + 0.1 PCT to 106.51 
* CPI-linked government bonds : + 0.09 PCT to 106.51 
* Unlinked government bonds : + 0.11 PCT to 107.05 
* Dollar-linked government bonds : + 0.12 PCT to 105.27

volume including Makams was a low 106 million shekels . 
&quot; There was surplus demand of 430 million shekels for unlinked bonds including Makams , &quot; said Gidi Halpern of Meitav Investments and Securities . 
&quot; yields are at nearly a two-year low . 
yields of the Makams are at 13.58 percent and yields for the unlinked bonds are at 13.85 percent . 
Halpern attributed the low yields to expectations of lower interest rates and of a tighter supply of bonds in coming months . 
the government has been under less pressure to issue bonds because of slimmer budget deficit and a surge in privatisation revenues . 
CPI-linked bonds , which also rose on Sunday , are already feeling the impact of tight supply Halpern said . 
he said prices also rose on fears that after the summer inflation could accelerate again . 
April &apos;s consumer price index was a low 0.7 percent , and most analysts are expecting continued low inflation at least for the coming three months . 
the Bank of Israel will publish its key lending rate for June on Monday . 
analysts said on Sunday that interest rates could fall as much as 0.5 percentage point from the current 13.9 percent but warned that the central bank might still decide to hold rates for another month . 
prices of dollar-linked bonds were higher because of a strengthening of the dollar worldwide , said a trader at IBI Investment House . 
note : Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year . 
the Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity .
