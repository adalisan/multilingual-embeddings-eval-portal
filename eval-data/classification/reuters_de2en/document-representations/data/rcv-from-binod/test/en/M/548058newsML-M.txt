the Baltic Freight Index ( BFI ) was down five to 1,259 and the Baltic handy Index down eight to 1,090 points . 
brokers reported increasing resistance from Panamax owners to the declining trend in rates and there was confidence in the owners camp that with more chartering orders now being quoted , steadier conditions will shortly apply , especially in the Atlantic . 
firmer rates were seen from the plate to Far East grain trades with Oldendorff fixing Drin 73,000 dwt at $ 12,500 daily plus $ 260,000 bonus and Continental Spirit 65,000 dwt $ 12,000 daily plus $ 250,000 bonus to Great Chance , both for early May delivery but on subjects .
