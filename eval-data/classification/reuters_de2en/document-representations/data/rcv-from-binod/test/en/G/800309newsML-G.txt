Pakistani cricket hero turned politician Imran Khan , ruled by a U.S. judge to be the father of an illegitimate five-year-old girl , on Thursday invited the child &apos;s mother to Pakistan to hear his side of the story . 
&quot; Imran Khan is the father of the child , &quot; Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner ( judge ) Anthony Jones ruled on Wednesday after hearing evidence from the child &apos;s mother , Sita White , daughter of the late British industrialist Lord Gordon White . 
Khan , defeated in his bid to become prime minister of Pakistan in February , did not appear in court but issued a statement through a London publicist . 
&quot; As I do not live in California or in England , my response is to welcome Sita White to Pakistan , where I live , &quot; he said . 
&quot; And I would more than welcome the opportunity to present my side of the story in a Pakistani court rather than conducting an undignified trial by media . 
White testified that she met Khan , then captain of the Pakistan cricket team , in 1988 , and conceived a child by him in 1991 . 
the girl , referred to in court only by her first and middle names , Tyrian jade , was born on June 15 , 1992 . 
White , who lives with her daughter in Beverly Hills , was also granted sole custody of the child , but indicated in court that she would be willing to allow Khan to visit the girl if he chose to . 
Khan , who has one son from his marriage to Jemima Goldsmith , daughter of the late tycoon Sir James Goldsmith , has steadfastly denied being the father of the girl . 
he married Jemima in 1995 . 
in his statement , he said : &quot; It is simply not possible for me to travel the world fighting court cases in every country . 
my work is in politics and with my ( cancer ) hospital in Pakistan .
