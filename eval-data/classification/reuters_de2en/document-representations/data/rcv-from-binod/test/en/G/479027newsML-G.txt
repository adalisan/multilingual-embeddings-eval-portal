suicide bombings in Gaza , the shooting deaths of two Palestinians in the West Bank and a war of words between Israel and Arab states pushed Middle East peacemaking closer to the edge on Tuesday . 
Israel said two men in Palestinian police uniforms blew themselves up in separate attacks aimed at Jewish settlers in the PLO-ruled Gaza Strip . 
one of the men wore a belt of explosives . 
no Israelis were hurt . 
Palestinian security officials said one man was a suicide bomber but they blamed Israeli soldiers for killing the second man and wounding five Palestinians in a taxi with a grenade . 
in the West Bank , Israeli soldiers shot a plainclothes Palestinian policeman in the head during clashes with stone-throwers after a protest march in Nablus . 
soldiers also shot dead a Palestinian teenager at a checkpoint in Hebron . 
youths hurled rocks at troops in Jenin and Qalqilya . 
they replied with rubber bullets and tear gas . 
it was the 13th consecutive day of unrest in Palestinian areas , the most sustained protests since the 1993 Israel-PLO peace accord . 
the violence mirrored a war of words between Israeli and Arab leaders that has erupted since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broke ground for a Jewish settlement designed to tighten Israel &apos;s grip on Arab East Jerusalem . 
Egypt , the first Arab state to make peace with Israel , said the settlement had brought roller-coaster Middle East peacemaking to a 20-year low point . 
Netanyahu shot back , accusing Egypt of fomenting anti-Israel sentiment in the Arab world , which was considering a freeze on normalising ties and re-instating an economic boycott of the Jewish state . 
it was the harshest exchange in years . 
in Washington President Bill Clinton said that Israel and the Palestinians had to restore an environment of security and confidence to revive the peace process and he had &quot; some ideas &quot; on how to do this . 
&quot; This is a difficult time in the peace process , and we have a lot to talk about , &quot; Clinton said at the start of a White House meeting with Jordan &apos;s King Hussein . 
asked if he would send U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to the Middle East , Clinton replied : &quot; At the right time I certainly want her to go , but I want it to be part of a clear strategy designed to produce progress . 
Arab states requested an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly session following two U.S. vetoes in the Security Council in the Mideast dispute , a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organisation said . 
Netanyahu said he was weighing a trip to Washington next week to seek U.S. help out of the impasse . 
Western officials said Washington was trying to put together a package of measures to defuse Israeli-Palestinian tensions . 
these would include accelerating talks on a final settlement of the 100-year-old Jewish-Arab conflict and an Israeli pledge to curb settlement . 
the U.S. had hoped passions would cool on both sides after initial protests over the Jerusalem building project but instead clashes have broken out in Palestinian towns and a Hamas suicide bomber killed three Israelis in a Tel Aviv cafe . 
Hamas , an Islamic fundamentalist group , denied it was behind the two Gaza explosions . 
it accused Israel of orchestrating the blasts to damage relations between Islamic groups and Arafat &apos;s self-rule Palestinian Authority . 
the Islamic Jihad group also denied responsibility . 
Arafat said one man had blown himself up and accused Israeli soldiers of killing the other . 
the Israeli army rejected Palestinian reports that a soldier had thrown a grenade or bomb . 
Netanyahu seized on the Gaza incidents as evidence that Arafat had given a green light to Hamas and the smaller Moslem group Islamic Jihad to attack Israelis . 
&quot; Today &apos;s twin attacks miraculously did not claim lives but they are proof that the terror campaign continues and that the light hasn &apos;t changed , &quot; Netanyahu told reporters . 
&quot; We think that what has to be done -- right now -- is that the Palestinian Authority fulfil its most basic commitment ... to fight terrorism . 
Arafat said a further crackdown could backfire . 
&quot; What will be the reaction from our side , to control more and more ? 
for every pressure there is a reaction . 
this is natural law , &quot; Arafat told a meeting in Gaza . 
the blasts occurred around 7 a.m. ( 0400 GMT ) as settlers and school children were leaving the isolated enclaves of Kfar Darom and Netzarim south of Gaza City . 
Hamas official Sayed Abu Musameh blamed Israel for the blasts . 
&quot; This bombing was done by the Israeli intelligence and its ( Palestinian ) collaborators in an attempt to create an internal problem between the Islamic movement and the Palestinian Authority , &quot; he told Reuters . 
on the political front Netanyahu said he was considering forming a unity coalition government with the Labour opposition and other parties to achieve a &quot; wide national front &quot; for a final peace deal . 
&quot; The big question is whether a unity government would create such a front or break it . 
would it be a government of unity or two governments , &quot; &apos; he told Army radio .
