Pakistan &apos;s Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said on Saturday the supply-side policies enshrined in the budget for fiscal 1997 / 98 ( July-June ) were the only way to haul the troubled economy out of recession . 
&quot; It &apos;s a bold strategy , it may be called a risky strategy , but there was no other option , &quot; Aziz told a news conference to explain the budget he unveiled in parliament on Friday . 
the budget , which imposed no new taxes , set a deficit target of 145 billion rupees , or five percent of gross domestic product , compared to a deficit of 154.6 billion rupees , or 6.2 percent of GDP , in 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; We adopted a bold strategy to allow the whole economy to revive and if that happens the budget deficit will fall , &quot; Aziz said . 
&quot; And in the meantime when our revenues are not increasing , we control our expenditure . 
the International Monetary Fund &apos;s resident representative , Shamsuddin Tariq , told Reuters the fund would send a mission to Pakistan in early July once it had digested the budget . 
&quot; We are looking at the budget , we are compiling the numbers and we expect a mission to come in early July to continue discussions with the Pakistani government , &quot; Tariq said . 
the IMF halted a standby loan to Pakistan in March after it became clear that agreed targets for 1996 / 97 could not be met . 
the Fund wanted to see containment of the 1996 / 97 budget deficit , setting a revised target of 6.2 percent of gross domestic product , and further fiscal consolidation in 1997 / 98 , with a deficit target of five percent of GDP . 
if the IMF finds the budget figures acceptable , it could offer Pakistan a new ESAF later this year , but it is not yet clear whether this would start before or after September . 
Aziz said a key element of economic revival was industrial growth for which several packages had already been announced . 
the budget withdrew one percent excise duty on bank loans , which Aziz said would reduce interest rates by 1.7 percent . 
he promised to keep government borrowing from banks to 55 billion rupees , against an estimated 88 billion in 1996 / 97 . 
the original target for this year was 20 billion rupees . 
his target is lower than the limit of 58 billion rupees set by the newly-autonomous State ( central ) Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) . 
but bankers said the interest rates were only likely to fall if the government remained within its borrowing target . 
Aziz said parliament had authorised the SBP board to bounce government cheques if the borrowing limit had been exceeded . 
&quot; This is self-discipline . 
this is a very important strategy and a very important decision , &quot; he added . 
stock prices have risen since the budget but analysts said any genuine revival would have to wait for the government &apos;s strategy of stimulating export-led growth to make an impact . 
the Karachi 100-share index climbed 9.56 points , or 0.61 percent , to close at 1,585.44 points in a computerised trading session on Saturday , usually a holiday . 
Sameer Ahmed , chief dealer at ING Baring , said a small post-budget spurt was possible , but the market lacked strength . 
&quot; There was nothing new in the budget . 
a lot of things had been announced earlier by the government through its various packages . 
there was only positive news for the cement and telecommunication sectors , &quot; he said .
