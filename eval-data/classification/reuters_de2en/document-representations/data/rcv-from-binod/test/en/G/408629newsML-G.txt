Iraq &apos;s health system is close to collapse because of shortages of medical supplies , Hiroshi Nakajima , head of the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , said on Thursday after a four-day visit to the country . 
in a statement issued by the United Nations health agency &apos;s headquarters in Geneva , Nakajima said power cuts were also a major cause of medical equipment breaking down . 
Iraqi officials told the WHO chief of their concerns over delays in receiving medicine and medical supplies under an &quot; oil-for-food &quot; deal with the United Nations , according to the statement . 
Nakajima , a Japanese pharmacologist , visited health facilities in Najaf , Kerbela , Babil and Baghdad . 
he said government drug warehouses and pharmacies had dwindling stocks and syringes and bandages were not available . 
&quot; The consequences of this situation are causing a near breakdown of the health care system , which is reeling under the pressure of being deprived of medicine , other basic supplies and spare parts , &quot; Nakajima was quoted as saying . 
diseases which had been virtually under control in Iraq were re-emerging , including malaria and water-borne diseases such as typhoid , according to the WHO statement . 
Iraq has been under international economic sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
under the limited deal implemented since last December , Baghdad is being allowed to buy food and medical supplies with a part of the $ 2 billion worth of oil it is allowed to sell over a six-month period . 
Nakajima discussed implementation of Security Council resolution 986 with Iraqi authorities , including WHO &apos;s role as &quot; observer &quot; to ensure equitable distribution of health products worth $ 210 million imported into Iraq in the six-month period . 
who also said it was serving as &quot; implementor &quot; for the health system in northern Iraq , where it will distribute $ 28.8 million worth of medicines and medical supplies .
