the candidate backed by Italy &apos;s main centre-right opposition Freedom Alliance led in a run-off mayoral contest in the major northern city of Milan on Sunday but the race in Turin was too close to call , a television poll showed . 
the poll , by the Abacus Institute for broadcasters RAI and Mediaset , was based on telephone questions to 1,000 people in each city . 
Sunday &apos;s second round local elections involved 77 mayors and five provincial presidents . 
the neighbouring cities of Milan and Turin were viewed as the key test in the elections . 
in another important race , the ruling Olive Tree coalition was seen ahead in the northeastern city of Trieste , the poll said . 
some 5.43 million Italians were eligible to vote in Sunday &apos;s elections which were held between the two frontrunners in places where no one gained more than 50 percent support in first round voting on April 27 . 
the first round ballot showed the left and right blocs roughly balanced on a national basis a year after Prime Minister Romano Prodi &apos;s broad-based coalition swept to power in a surprise general election win . 
the television poll put the centre-left ahead in mayoral races in the cities of Lecco , Novara and Ancona . 
the centre-right led in Catanzaro and Crotone while the separatist Northern League party led in Pordenone . 
the poll gave no percentages but more detailed forecasts were due later .
