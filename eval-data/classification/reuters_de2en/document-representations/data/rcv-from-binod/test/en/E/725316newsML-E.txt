Britain &apos;s public sector debt is expected to increase by four billion pounds ( $ 6.8 billion ) or more in June as hefty interest payments on government bonds and weak VAT returns hit the public finances . 
a Reuter poll of economists produced a consensus forecasting a public sector borrowing requirement of 4.1 billion stg in June , just above May &apos;s 4.0 billion revenue shortfall . 
the picture could have been worse were it not for 700 million pounds of revenue from the second call on the shares of privatised UK rail infrastructure giant , Railtrack plc . 
&quot; privatisation proceeds from ... Railtrack will have inflated the Treasury &apos;s coffers during June , although this must be offset against the usual surge in interest payments , &quot; said David Philpotts , UK economist at Schroders . 
the Office for National Statistics said last month that June is increasingly a peak month for interest payments because gilts are now being issued with aligned coupon dates in June and December . 
interest of 2.7 billion stg will have to be paid this June compared with 1.5 billion in June last year . 
the ons also said value-added-tax receipts last month were expected to be lower than the same month last year . 
&quot; We have allowed for receipts to be almost three percent lower than last June , &quot; she said , pencilling in a 4.8 billion PSBR overall . 
but the VAT timing effect will mean a balancing rebound in sales tax receipts in July , said Michael Saunders , UK economist at Salomon Brothers . 
he forecast a yawning 5.2 billion stg gap between government expenditure and revenue last month , but said there was little cause for concern . 
&quot; Such a figure would not stop the PSBR overshooting the Treasury &apos;s 10.9 billion forecast significantly over the full fiscal year , &quot; he said . 
the Red Book from Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown &apos;s first budget on July 2 forecast a 1997 / 98 PSBR of 10.9 billion pounds . 
excluding the first tranche of the windfall levy , which will be paid by Britain &apos;s privatised utilities in December , the PSBR is expected to total 13.3 billion pounds this financial year . 
&quot; The government &apos;s new forecast for the full-year PSBR is a realistic one , &quot; Philpotts said .
