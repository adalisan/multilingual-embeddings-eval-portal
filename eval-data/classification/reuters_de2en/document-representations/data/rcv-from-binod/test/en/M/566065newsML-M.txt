* AUD extended bounce from $ 0.7735 lows to repair some of the technical damage done by retreat from $ 0.7860 
* But stalled short of $ 0.7790 target and while beneath there risk is for eventual retracement to $ 0.7690 bear target 
* Monetary policy outlook to become clearer as RBA governor Macfarlane speaking at 10.00 am and key jobs data at 11.30 am 
on the crosses it settled at 97.42 / 52 yen having slid to 97.38 / 48 late Wednesday from atop 99.00 at the start of the week . 
the yen was had been buoyed by gains in Japanese share and yield prices which had made the recovery look a little more secure and led to thoughts of higher official interest rates . 
however , traders said Japanese investors still seemed to be keen buyers of A $ bonds , both government and dual currency samurai issues , so 97.00 support looked safe for the moment . 
the dollar also recouped ground on sterling as a set of soft U.K. production data tempered speculation of further rate hikes there . 
it firmed to 0.4810 / 16 stg from 0.4740 / 46 . 
the outlook for domestic interest rates was much on the mind of the market with Reserve Bank governor set to give his first semi-annual testimony on the conduct of monetary policy before a Parliamentary committee . 
as part of this the bank will release its latest assessment of the economy and policy at 0000 GMT and Macfarlane will be questioned by the committee afterwards . 
analysts generally expect him to point to signs of recovery as a reason for keeping rates steady , at least for now . 
such a statement would quell the rate talk for another month and probably see further short covering twoard 78 cents . 
however , the situation would be confused by the release of labour data for April at 11.30 ( 0130 GMT ) which Macfarlane could well find himself questioned on . 
it was surprise falls in employment for February and March which first stirred talk of another easing and a further drop in April would put the RBA under intense pressure to cut . 
most analysts , however , expect employment to bounce back by around 35,000 after a shock 33,900 dive the month before .
