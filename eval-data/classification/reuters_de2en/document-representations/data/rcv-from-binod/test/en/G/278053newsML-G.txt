the Group of Seven ( G7 ) industrialised nations and Russia said on Friday they supported Peru &apos;s efforts to end the 10-day hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima peacefully . 
a G7 communique issued by France , which holds the group &apos;s rotating presidency , said the G7 &quot; reaffirmed the general principle under which no concession must be made in the face of a terrorist action &quot; . 
G7 countries &quot; express their solidarity with the Peruvian government and support its efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully , with the main objective of sparing human lives &quot; , the statement said . 
&quot; They are prepared , individually and collectively , to help the Peruvian government by using all the appropriate means that it could request , &quot; it said . 
the group said no political or ideological aim could justify the attack on the Japanese embassy in Lima where Marxist guerrillas are holding more than 100 hostages . 
Japan revealed earlier in the day that it was consulting fellow G7 members to try to work out a solution to the crisis .
