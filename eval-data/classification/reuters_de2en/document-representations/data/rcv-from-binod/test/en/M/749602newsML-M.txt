NYMEX electricity futures were trading higher Tuesday despite bearish fundamentals in a move that had some players slightly baffled , industry sources said . 
&quot; fundamentally things haven &apos;t changed that much other than there are some calls for some slightly warmer weather in the West next week , &quot; said one futures trader . 
sources said that in addition to the warmer weather , some shortcovering may have given price strength Wednesday despite bearish fundamentals like increased Western power generation , near-normal weather and lower physical power prices . 
as of 1225 EDT , NYMEX August Palo Verde ( PV ) was trading up $ 1.20 at the day &apos;s high of $ 35.00 per megawatt hour ( MWh ) following exchanges as low as $ 33.50 , while September was up 84 cents at the day &apos;s high of $ 28.20 after trade as low as $ 27.25 per MWh . 
August California Oregon Border ( COB ) was trading up 54 cents at the day &apos;s high of $ 21.00 following exchanges as low as $ 20.35 , while September was up 48 cents at the day &apos;s high of $ 21.50 after trade as low as $ 21.15 per MWh . 
physical power prices in the West were said to be falling , while the two units at the San Onofre Nuclear generating Station ( songs ) were operating near full output . 
the operator Southern California Edison Co said both songs units would resume full output before the end of the week . 
forecasters expected seasonal summer weather across most of the West through next week . 
coastal cities from Seattle to Los Angeles were forecast to see readings in the 70s Fahrenheit area , while interior centers in Southwest like Phoenix and Las Vegas were called to hit the 100 degree mark later this week . 
the Western Systems Coordinating Council was tentatively set to vote this week on raising the capacity of the Pacific Intertie transmission system to 6,900 MW from 6,300 MW . 
increased power flow from the hydroelectric projects in the Pacific Northwest to southern California would take effect August 1 .
