U.S. Plains feedlot cattle traded actively Tuesday at $ 68.00 per cwt , steady with the top price on Monday , but down $ 2.00 from last week &apos;s top , feedlot sources said . 
about 35,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area and about 20,000 in Kansas , they said . 
actual totals could be higher once all the paperwork is filed , sources said . 
sales turned active near midday as packers bought before thanksgiving Day on Thursday . 
activity Wednesday was seen light and no business was expected on the holiday . 
prices were lower than last week &apos;s on increased supplies of cattle on showlists , sources said . 
declines also were attributed to continued fallout from Friday &apos;s bearish USDA Cattle-On-Feed Report , they said . 
the report showed feedlot supplies as of November 1 up one percent from year-earlier levels and October placements were up 11 percent . 
both categories were above trade expectations while the number of cattle marketed during October was below a year ago as well as below expectations .
