the West African crude tanker market looks set to fall as the U.S. shows a preference for Middle Eastern cargoes , brokers said on Friday . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of Arab crude going to the U.S. with freight rates down from the ( Middle East ) Gulf . 
&quot; Demand from West Africa is falling as a result , &quot; one broker said . 
rates for 130,000 tonnes from West Africa to the U.S. Gulf / USAC were currently put at W82.5 and W85 for the Knock Sheen and London Splendour , both for Sun , but the broker said rates were likely to fall next week . 
from the Gulf to South Korea , W62 was seen for the 1992-built Irian for Ssangyong , which brokers said was typical for a new vessel and reflected Korean insistence on modern tonnage . 
in the transatlantic sector , the Nisyros was seen fixed at W80 for 134,000 tonnes for Koch from hound Point to the U.S. Gulf . 
the Kamlesh was seen fixed with 130,000 tonnes from Norway to the Med at about W95 for Statoil , while in the Western Hemisphere , Caribs / USAC was fixed around W195 for 50,000 tonnes . 
the charterer was not reported . 
Asian fixtures were relatively sparse , but included two 80,000 tonners , the Bering Sea from Pulau Sambu to South Korea at W132.5 for LG and the Loul &apos;wat Qatar from Dampier to Singapore at W130 for Mobil .
