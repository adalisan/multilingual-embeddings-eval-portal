LIFFE cocoa futures closed stronger across the board , but volume was extremely light on Friday . 
may ended up 11 stg at 1,013 stg per tonne , and July rose eight to 1,025 . 
but traders stressed that trade was scattered and thin , with total volume tallying only 4,190 contracts . 
July led with 1,339 lots . 
no options traded . 
activity eased before the weekend as the market rested from a hectic and volatile week . 
prices plunged on Monday to about one-month lows on heavy fund sales and then traded choppily the rest of the week before drifting to a weekly high on Friday afternoon . 
after the week &apos;s rollercoaster activity , traders were split on cocoa &apos;s near-term outlook . 
some saw cocoa resuming its rise after July met its 50-percent retracement objective near 980 . 
with origins already well-sold for their crops , they said cocoa had room to move up and lure funds back into a buying mode . 
if cocoa gained another 20 to 30 stg , they said funds could become interested again and help push July up toward 1,100 to 1,150 within the next few weeks . 
but others were not as optimistic . 
they said cocoa &apos;s firmness over the past two days was not yet evidence enough that cocoa had shaken off its downward momentum . 
technically , they said July would have to scale its April 2 peak of 1,065 stg before adding any sustainable gains . 
fundamentally , they said cocoa could suffer another bout of selling as more signs emerge that this year &apos;s cocoa deficit will be smaller than forecasts from six months ago due to Ivorian crop estimates . 
Ivorian port cocoa stocks from the main crop were seen at up to 175,000 tonnes as arrivals trickle in at about 1,000 tonnes per week , but port sources in Abidjan said April and brisk May exports will reduce levels . 
but exporters are gearing up for mid-crop arrivals from Easter holidays and crop analysts have not completed up-country pod tallies to give an indication of volumes . 
but early estimates ranged from 100,000 tonnes to well above 160,000 , down from 200,000 in the 1995 / 96 season . 
warehouse stocks totalled up to 400,000 tonnes in early 1997 as exporters held back cocoa bought in auction for December contracts from the Caistab marketing body . 
some analysts also speculated that funds were still net long cocoa and that if prices did not rise sharply soon , they would lose interest and have ammunition to provoke another sell-off . 
July support rests at 985 , but a close below 987 was seen raising the risk for a drop toward 940 . 
physical buyers were seen hampered by the rise in sterling this week , and news Ghana cocoa purchases reached 902 tonnes in the 23rd week of the 1996 / 97 season had little impact on the market .
