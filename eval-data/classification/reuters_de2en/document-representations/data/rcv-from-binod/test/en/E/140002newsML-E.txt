an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) mission is expected to arrive in Bulgaria on October 30 to evaluate the country &apos;s economic performance and help draft next year &apos;s budget frame , an IMF official said on Thursday . 
&quot; The mission will arrive next Wednesday with the object to reach agreement on a policy framework that would release the second tranche , &quot; IMF Sofia representative Franek Rozwadowski told Reuters . 
the IMF postponed a $ 115 million tranche last month until the government fulfilled its pledges to close down loss-making state enterprises and speed up privatisation . 
the Socialist government said it would complete slow-moving closures of 64 loss-makers by end-October . 
it also announced plans to sell-off some 15 to 20 big state firms by year-end to boost its balance of payments . 
if the Fund found Bulgaria &apos;s reform pace acceptable , Sofia stood to receive the second and the third tranche worth together some $ 180 million by year-end , said recently another IMF official who declined to be named . 
the IMF mission is also expected to draft next year &apos;s macroeconomic frame jointly with the government , but drafting budget assumptions under current record high interest rates of 240 percent is unrealistic , economists say .
