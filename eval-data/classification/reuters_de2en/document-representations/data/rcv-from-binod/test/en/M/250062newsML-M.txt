worries over the next move on Wall Street , the world &apos;s biggest stock market , hit European shares on Wednesday morning in the wake of losses in key Asian markets . 
futures prices slipped and U.S. share prices quoted in London weakened , pointing to a pronounced drop when the New York market opens and recalling the spectre of markets awash with red ink at the end of last week . 
the dollar was also under pressure on a currency market that was nervously awaiting the reopening of New York markets and U.S. producer price ( PPI ) data due at 1330 GMT . 
concern that Japanese and other investors could trim their holdings of U.S. assets was undermining market sentiment for the dollar , market analysts said . 
European investors in turn fretted that the dollar &apos;s slide could herald a disposal of dollar-based assets by foreign investors , share dealers said . 
&quot; Asset prices , be they dollar , bonds or shares are overpriced in the U.S. 
there is a real worry in the market that the Japanese and other foreign investors may cut down on the buying of U.S. securities , &quot; said Michael Burke , economist at Citibank . 
adding to the pressure , European bond futures skidded lower , led down by a soft U.S. Treasury market and technical year-end selling . 
&quot; The market &apos;s very very nervous , &quot; said Norman Beauchamp , head of derivatives at Cooperative Bank in London . 
&quot; Once it does break some key levels , it just exaggerates itself and everyone jumps on the bandwagon . 
the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks in London , Europe &apos;s leading stock market , had lost more than 50 points by the end of the morning . 
London share traders said a reversal in market sentiment , after two days of recovery in share prices , was prompted by a Wall Street Journal article suggesting that a slowdown in Japanese purchases of U.S. debt could depress U.S. markets . 
this hit exchanges that had clawed their way back from sharp losses after remarks by U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan on the &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; of the U.S. stock market . 
then trading in IBM shares came to a virtual halt in Europe after rumours circulated in late morning that the computer giant could be on the verge of issuing a profits warning , London dealers said . 
&quot; The market was already weak when the IBM rumour came flying around . 
it has really set the tone for the day , &quot; one senior London share dealer said . 
&quot; The Dow is looking vulnerable . 
the Dow Jones industrial average of U.S. blue chips closed 9.31 points higher at 6,473.25 on Tuesday after being up 28 points as London markets closed . 
French and German shares lost around 1.5 percent in sympathy with other stock markets and amid investor concern that Wall Street might have peaked after a record-breaking run . 
the dollar was also jolted by widening of more than 31 percent in Japan &apos;s October trade surplus with the United States , mainly due to a boost in vehicle exports . 
economists expect November &apos;s U.S. producer prices to show a rise of 0.3 percent after October &apos;s 0.4 percent gain . 
any faster increase would raise fears of higher interest rates . 
the dollar was quoted at 112.85 yen and 1.5425 marks against 113.29 and 1.5539 in late European business on Tuesday . 
the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 56.7 points lower at 3,979.0 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index was down 34.79 at 2,216.61 . 
in Asian trading , Tokyo &apos;s Nikkei 225 closed 253.74 points or 1.22 percent lower at 20,568.38 , while Hong Kong &apos;s Hang Seng Index fell 152.86 points or 1.15 percent to 13,189.60 . 
gold rose to $ 370.05 an ounce after a morning fix of $ 369.60 , compared with Tuesday &apos;s close of $ 368.25 . 
silver gained to $ 4.87 versus $ 4.81 .
