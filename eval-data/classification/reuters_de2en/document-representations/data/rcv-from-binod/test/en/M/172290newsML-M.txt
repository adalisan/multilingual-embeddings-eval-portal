South African long bond yields hurtled lower on Wednesday in options related buying ahead of the week &apos;s close-out . 
the yield on government &apos;s key R150 bond was at 15.845 percent shortly after the noon close-out and unexpectedly sank lower in the afternoon to 15.78 percent as players covered short positions . 
&quot; Most expected the market to retrace in the afternoon ( after the options close-out ) and when it unexpectedly came down players dived to cover shorts , &quot; a bond trader said . 
&quot; It was purely an institutional play , &quot; another said . 
at 1421 GMT the benchmark R150 stock was at 15.85 percent from the afternoon low of 15.78 percent and 15.89 percent at the close on Wednesday . 
a senior trader said the market moved stronger before noon on a large order for R153 stock which triggered both local and foreign buying . 
&quot; It was local institutional buying , foreign buying and curve buying , &quot; he said , adding that there were a lot of put options to cover ahead of the noon close-out . 
healthy volumes had moved through the market . 
some dealers felt a retracement was on the cards on Friday amid perceptions that the morning &apos;s moves had been overdone . 
they said prospects of a poor October reserves figure due ot at 1600 GMT on Thursday , money market pressures and weaker U.S. treasuries painted a negative short-term outlook . 
economists polled by Reuters forecast gross reserves would decline to 9.6 billion rand from 10 billion rand in September , equivalent to just under four weeks import cover . 
the Bond Exchange said foreigners bought 242.84 million rand of South African bonds on Wednesday after selling a net 189.94 million rand on Tuesday . 
nominal cumulative volumes stood at 9.29 billion rand on Wednesday from 4.47 billion rand on Tuesday . 
on the currency market the rand ended little changed from its previous close after hovering around the 4.70 level in intraday trade . 
the unit briefly dipped below 4.70 on the dollar in line with bond market gains but dealers said trade had been orderly and there had been few big speculators . 
at 1421 GMT it was at 4.7025 / 7075 on the dollar from 4.6990 / 7040 overnight and the day &apos;s strongest level of 4.6880 bid . 
late offshore and local dollar demand and nervousness ahead of the release of reserves figures and a conference in Cape Town on Friday where finance minister Trevor Manuel , Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals and finance DG Maria Ramos are scheduled to speak drove the unit weaker in after-hours trade . 
&quot; All eyes are on the reserves figure and the conference tomorrow ( Friday ) , &quot; a senior forex dealer said . 
in addition , the rand was knocked by a report by UK-based Old Mutual International Asset Managers which predicted the rand was heading to 5.0 against the dollar . 
the report also said the country should adopt the &quot; big bang &quot; approach to scrapping foreign exchange controls . 
on the money market , three-month NCD rates were steady at between 16.75 to 16.90 percent , while the 90-day BA rate was also unchanged at between 16.10 to 16.25 percent after rates kicked up sharply on Wednesday . 
the Reserve Bank indicated the daily shortage lower at 8.829 billion rand on Wednesday from 9.379 billion rand on Tuesday .
