Russian experts will meet on Monday to set the final date for cosmonauts to carry out unprecedented repairs inside a damaged module on their Mir space station , a Mission Control duty officer said on Sunday . 
Mir has been limping around the Earth with reduced power since a cargo tug collided with the sprawling station on June 25 , puncturing its Spektr science module and damaging energy-giving solar panels . 
it was the worst accident in Mir &apos;s 11-year history , and its future depends on the repairs . 
&quot; Tomorrow a state commission ( tackling the crisis ) will decide the final date for going into the Spektr module , &quot; the officer , who declined to be named , told Reuters at Mission Control outside Moscow . 
&quot; At the moment we think it will take place in the night from July 17 to 18 . 
Russian space officials have already given this date as the preferred timing for the delicate repair work on the 11-year-old station but have hitherto said the date could be shifted . 
the officer said the two Russian cosmonauts and British-born NASA astronaut Michael Foale would spend part of Sunday preparing for the repairs and then speak to their families . 
&quot; The cosmonauts will clear equipment to make room for the work , &quot; he said . 
Mir lost about half its power in the collision . 
the aim is for a cosmonaut to reattach 17 internal cables during the repairs and so restore power from some of Spektr &apos;s solar panels . 
on Tuesday , the crew plans a dress rehearsal of their difficult repair job , which involves donning space suits inside the Mir and practising linking the cables . 
the officer said Foale and the cosmonauts --Vasily Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin -- would speak to their families later on Sunday . 
the Russians would talk by a video link . 
Foale would speak to his family in the United States by telephone . 
the calls are private and Mission Control does not listen in . 
new transmitters sent up as part of a cargo shipment last week will not only help the crew to speak to their families but also to ground control during the repair work . 
during the repairs a cosmonaut will install a new hatch separating the Spektr from Mir &apos;s other cluttered array of modules . 
unlike the old hatch , the new one can be closed without requiring the cables to the solar panels to be unplugged . 
but the repair is expected to be difficult as the Russian cosmonaut doing the work , with a second in reserve nearby , will be dressed in a bulky spacesuit and be operating in a cramped interior area of the station , space officials say . 
Foale will sit in the Soyuz escape module during the work .
