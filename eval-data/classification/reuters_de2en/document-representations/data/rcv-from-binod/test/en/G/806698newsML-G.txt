Egyptian judges will give a verdict on August 31 on an Israeli man and his alleged Egyptian accomplice on charges they spied in Egypt , the main judge told a hearing in the trial on Monday . 
Israeli Druze textile technician Azam Azam and Egyptian Emad Abdelhalim Ismail have pleaded not guilty to charges they made criminal arrangements to spy for the Israeli intelligence service Mossad . 
two Israeli Druze women -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are on trial in absentia for the same charges . 
the case , which began on April 24 , brought Egypt-Israeli ties to one of their lowest ebbs since their 1979 peace treaty .
