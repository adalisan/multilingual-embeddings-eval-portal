government officials said on Thursday that Burmese refugees insist they will not return home until their military-ruled country has achieved democracy . 
&quot; We are at a loss ( about what to do ) as the defiant Rohingya refugees appear quite stubborn on their precondition that they will go back home only if democracy is ushered in Myanmar ( Burma ) , &quot; a senior official said . 
&quot; We are worried ... and a bit perplexed , too . 
another official , Qamrul Huda , the government &apos;s Relief and Repatriation Commissioner , said : &quot; We will not force them to go , but Bangladesh cannot afford to give them permanent residence . 
nor would Bangladesh be able to ensure Burma &apos;s return to democracy . 
his comments to Reuters came after some 21,000 refugees again turned down requests to accept food rations despite complaining that scores of their number in two camps had fallen sick after refusing food since July 21 . 
&quot; Every time we go back to them with food they say &apos; no , &apos; but we cannot force them to take it , &quot; said one official who declined to be identified . 
&quot; They are behaving strangely , apparently hoping that Bangladesh will be held responsible for any consequences , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Unless the refugees budge from their stance , maybe we will have to ignore their plight . 
the Burmese Moslem refugees , known as Rohingyas , began a food boycott on July 21 as part of a protest against what they believe are attempts by Bangladesh to forcibly repatriate them . 
clashes between police and Rohingyas resisting deportation on July 20 left nearly 20 people injured , forcing authorities to postpone the repatriation from the Nayapara and Kutupalong camps . 
the officials said they had repeatedly reassured the 21,000 refugees , the remnants of 250,000 Rohingyas who crossed into Bangladesh in early 1992 to escape alleged persecution by Burma &apos;s military junta , that Dhaka would not send anyone home against their will . 
the refugees on Wednesday handed a list of demands to the government officials . 
&quot; They include permission for the Rohingyas in the refugee camps to stay in Bangladesh until democracy is restored in Myanmar ( Burma ) , &quot; one official said . 
van To Nguyen , the representative of the UNHCR relief agency in Cox &apos;s Bazar , said on Wednesday night that he saw no immediate solution to the crisis . 
Cox &apos;s Bazaar borders on west Burma &apos;s Arakan province , home of the Rohingyas . 
&quot; I see no immediate solution to the problem , &quot; he said after visiting the refugee camps with Huda and other senior government officials . 
earlier this month the UNHCR lodged a strong protest with the Bangladesh government over the alleged forcible deportation of the refugees from camps lining the highway from Cox &apos;s Bazar to Teknaf on the southernmost tip of Bangladesh . 
meanwhile , the refugees , provoked by their militant leaders , some of whom Bangladesh believes could be members of separatist guerrilla groups , continued to shout abuse at officials and security personnel . 
&quot; We are keeping our patience but there is a limit to everything , &quot; one police officer at Nayapara told reporters on Thursday . 
&quot; The militants are also preventing officials from entering their camps . 
so it &apos;s not possible to count how many people are sick or if anyone has died , &quot; he said .
