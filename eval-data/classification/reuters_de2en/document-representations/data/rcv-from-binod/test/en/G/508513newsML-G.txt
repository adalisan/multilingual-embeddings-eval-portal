Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso , who scored two goals in Udinese &apos;s stunning 3-0 defeat of league leaders Juventus on Sunday , has signed an improved contract keeping him at the club until 2002 . 
the shaven-headed player , dubbed the &quot; Ronaldo of Udine &quot; after Barcelona &apos;s Brazilian ace , had been linked to other Italian and English clubs but said that he wanted to stay if Udinese raised his salary . 
club officials said on Tuesday that a new , improved contract had been signed . 
Amoroso joined provincial Udinese from Brazilian club Flamengo at the start of the season . 
one of his country &apos;s most promising players , he was joint-top scorer in the 1994 Brazilian championship at Guarani but suffered a long layoff after a knee injury in 1995 that prevented him from playing for the national team .
