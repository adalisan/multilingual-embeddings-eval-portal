the dollar &apos;s exchange rate against the mark is more likely to appreciate than it is to fall , said Geman Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see room for much going down of the dollar , but more for going up of the dollar , &quot; Jochimsen said in an exclusive interview with Reuters Financial Television on Wednesday . 
when asked if the dollar &apos;s current exchange rate near 1.50 marks was an an appropriate level , Jochimsen said the Bundesbank &apos;s prime objective was internal stability and noted that Germany had achieved virtual price stability . 
&quot; Having said this I think in the currency markets the Japanese announcements , which have been contradicted also , have of course started some new debate on the appropriate level , &quot; Jochimsen added . 
recent remarks by Japanese finance officials raised market concerns that the G-3 countries were abandoning a policy of favoring a strong dollar .
