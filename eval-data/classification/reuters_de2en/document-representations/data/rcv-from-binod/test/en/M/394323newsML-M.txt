implied volatilities for U.S. debt options were pressured by concerns over weekend time decay , with the underlying markets slightly lower but largely range-bound , dealers said . 
&quot; Look at our range ( in Treasury bond futures ) , &quot; said a brokerage trader at the Chicago Board of Trade . 
March futures were off 3 / 32 at 112-30 / 32 in late trade after drifting to and fro between 113-1 / 32 and 112-24 / 32 . 
he noted that trading was confined to minor position adjustments as the market awaited Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony next Wednesday . 
still , with volatilities already at historically low levels , depression was limited mostly to the front end of the volatility curve . 
implied volatilities for CBOT April T-bond futures options eased 0.2 point on the day to 9.3 percent , while June was basically steady at 9.7 percent . 
traders said the expiration today of March options had little effect on the futures market , as open interest in the 113 strike had shrunk and volatility had been crushed on Thursday . 
volatilities were also steady to easier at the shorter end of the yield curve , with the front months hurting the most because of their steeper time decay . 
&quot; There &apos;s no economic data to speak of today and the market &apos;s going nowhere , &quot; said a Eurodollar trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . 
implied volatilities for June and September Eurodollar futures options were steady to marginally easier at 8.2 and 12.7 percent respectively .
