the volume of seven-day funds 
absorbed by the Central Bank of Malta in its latest weekly reverse repo auction contracted sharply to 6.4 million Malta pounds from 12.3 million the week before , the Central Bank said in its weekly money market report on Monday . 
the bank said the decline reflected lower levels of short-term excess liquidity in the banking system as the credit institutions replenished their reserve deposit accounts with the Central Bank . 
as a result , the weighted average reverse repo rate at the start of the week rose to 5.085 percent from the previous weekOs 5.083 percent . 
the banks earlier this month took up more than half an issue of 30 million pounds in government bonds which was later increased to 88 million pounds after it was over- subscribed . 
the Central Bank said the inter-bank market saw a turnover of 8.4 million pounds in the week ending on June 13 , up from 5.8 million pounds the previous week . 
the bulk of transactions consisted mainly of overnight and seven day deposits . 
overnight rates , at 5.10 percent were slightly higher than the previous week , but seven-day money was practically unchanged at 5.25 percent . 
in the primary market for treasury bills , new issues continued to be limited in the light of the government &apos;s strong cash flow position . 
bills for a total of 80,000 pounds were issued on Friday , which was only a fraction of the 14 million pounds maturing on the same day . 
the bills had a maturity of 182-days . 
the weighted average rate dropped marginally from 5.2884 per cent to 5.2882 per cent . 
the Treasury on Tuesday will receive applications for 91-day bills to be issued on Friday .
