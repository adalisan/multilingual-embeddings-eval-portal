the Spanish Football Federation will take legal action against Atletico Madrid president Jesus Gil after an angry incident at a meeting on Thursday , a spokesman said . 
Gil was annoyed at being barred from a federation meeting because of a suspension he is serving for a previous clash with the soccer authorities in March . 
Federation spokesman Fernando Garrido said officials had consulted lawyers after Thursday &apos;s incident . 
&quot; He has called directors of the federation clowns and cheapskates , &quot; Garrido said . 
&quot; He has said we force referees to act in a certain way , that the league is fixed , and proffered endless insults . 
Gil eventually gained entry to Thursday &apos;s meeting despite the suspension which , in theory , means that he cannot carry out his duties at Atletico and is not allowed to sign contracts or even attend games in his official capacity . 
but Gil , who has been suspended 11 times in his 10 years as Atletico president , has ignored most of the previous restrictions placed on him .
