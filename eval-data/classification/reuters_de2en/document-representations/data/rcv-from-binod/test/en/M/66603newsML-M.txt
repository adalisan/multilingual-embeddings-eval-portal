international liquefied petroleum Gas ( LPG ) prices strengthened over the week as U.S. arbitrage demand continued to suck up material from surrounding regions , traders said on Friday . 
&quot; The market is watching U.S. prices going higher and higher , &quot; one player in northwest Europe said . 
material was heard having moved west out of Europe in the past week but quantities were hard to pin down . 
an end-user was heard buying around 8,000 tonnes of propane at $ 250 CIF NWE . 
but higher offers were seen , with one U.K. player weighing in with an offer at $ 252 fob Tees . 
this was not thought representative of the market , however . 
but liquidity was sapped on Friday because of an industry golfing function in the U.K. 
dealers said NWE cargo prices were currently being assessed directly from U.S. netback prices . 
allowing for freight of around $ 10- $ 15 a tonne , these were worked out at around $ 255 for propane on Friday .
