fourth quarter U.S. 
gross Domestic Product may come in below two percent , San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Parry said Monday . 
&quot; Fourth quarter is likely to be relatively similar ( to Q3 &apos;s two percent ) although if I were to bet , it would be lower than two percent , &quot; he told reporters after addressing a meeting sponsored by the bank and Tucson Chamber of Commerce . 
&quot; There won &apos;t be any big changes in 1997 ( in GDP growth and inflation ) ... although there is a risk of a slight uptick in inflation , &quot; he said , adding that overall CPI and its core rate could creep up by &quot; a couple of tenths &quot; in coming months . 
&quot; But I don &apos;t see that as a breaking-out of inflation , &quot; he said .
