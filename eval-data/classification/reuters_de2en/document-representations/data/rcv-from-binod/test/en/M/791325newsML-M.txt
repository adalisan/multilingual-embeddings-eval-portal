crude sentiment firmed modestly in Asia on Monday , with September WTI crude futures inching back to $ 19.60 as of 0845 GMT , following a 55-cent Iraq-inspired drop in Friday NYMEX trade which brought the U.S. benchmark to close at $ 19.54 . 
but traders said that the triple threat of an 11 million barrel wave of eastbound West African crude oil , the likelihood that Iraqi oil would head for China and eventually Japan in September , and ample regional middle-distillate supplies cast a bearish shadow in the medium term . 
physical deals on Monday were sparse , with a pair of Abu Dhabi grade deals shaving down what have been stubborn supplies for September . 
two deals pegged values for September Murban at ADNOC plus 8 cents , with a 500,000 parcel and a 300,000 parcel both reported sold to European major , from a British and a French major , respectively . 
the deals leave a little over two cargoes of September Abu Dhabi grade availability , traders said . 
separately , 450,000 barrels of September Masila was heard sold a Japan trader into China at Dubai plus 20 cents . 
trader eyebrows were raised by news that Chinese and Tawanese buyers had picked up an estimated 11 million barrels of West African material for September delivery , in spite of a fattening Brent / Dubai differential . 
&quot; I study the differential everyday for opportunities to take West African , but the current levels of $ 1.20 or so are not profitable for us , &quot; said a trader with a Japanese refiner . 
&quot; It is confusing to me that they have made this purchase , &quot; he added . 
the Chinese and Taiwanese purchases included Camerounian Kole , Angolan Palanca , Nigerian Forcados , and Congo &apos;s Djeno grade , traders said . 
although Japan traders have so far been excluded from Iraqi oil negotations , Japan refiners still hope to secure volumes follwing the September 5 start to the second 90 days of the U.N. food-for-oil deal &apos;s second phase . 
traders said they expected Iraq to renew contracts with China before September 5 .
