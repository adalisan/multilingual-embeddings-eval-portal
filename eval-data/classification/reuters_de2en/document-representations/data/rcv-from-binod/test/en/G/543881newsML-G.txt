the United States frigate Halyburton docked at the southern Yemeni port of Aden on Monday on the first visit to the harbour by a U.S. warship in 30 years , officials said . 
the U.S. embassy said in a statement the guided-missile frigate &apos;s &quot; friendly call &quot; on Aden was part of a regional tour . 
the warship arrived from Bahrain and its 250 crew would carry out humanitarian work in the impoverished city such as painting walls of charitable societies and schools , it said . 
Aden was designated as the economic and commercial capital of the unified country after a 1990 agreement on the merger between the once royalist Yemen Arab Republic in the north and the Marxist People &apos;s Democratic Republic of the Yemen in the south .
