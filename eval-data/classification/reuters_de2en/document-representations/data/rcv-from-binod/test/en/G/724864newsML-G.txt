a French anti-racist group said on Sunday it would defy a ban by the extreme-right mayor of Toulon and go ahead with a planned Bastille Day festival in the Mediterranean port city on Monday . 
Fode Sylla , president of SOS-Racisme , said mayor Jean-Marie Le Chevallier of the anti-immigration National Front had no grounds for banning the long-planned open-air event . 
Le Chevallier , who initially cited a threat to public order , told Reuters he had given prior permission for a jazz festival on the same site and &quot; there is no justification for wanting to occupy it &quot; . 
&quot; If the SOS-Racisme people attack jazz musicians , they &apos;ll have to answer in court , &quot; he said . 
but Sylla said : &quot; SOS-Racisme and the organising association call on all citizens to meet on the zenith square from 4 p.m. ( 1400 GMT ) , including the jazz group the mayor is talking about , which is cordially invited to join us in song and celebration . 
the National Front , which advocates sending home three million immigrants and limiting jobs , social services and public housing to native-born French people , has long been at loggerheads with SOS-Racisme . 
the movement has brought private prosecutions against its leader Jean-Marie Le Pen for espousing the theory of racial inequality and making ethnic slurs . 
Le Pen was recently fined for calling the Senegalese-born Sylla a &quot; mad , fat zebu &quot; .
