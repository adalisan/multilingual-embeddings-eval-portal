an unexpected surge in UK M4 broad money supply has stepped up the pressure for higher interest rates and taxes to curb soaring consumer demand , analysts say . 
UK M4 rose an annual 11.1 percent in May , compared with the 10.2 percent growth rate in April and expectations it would sink to 10 percent . 
the measure remains uncomfortably above the official three to nine percent monitoring range and is likely to fuel Bank of England concern about inflationary pressures . 
analysts warn that if Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown wants to stave off further interest rate rises then he needs to increases taxes by more than the two to three billion stg the markets are currently expecting . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think anything less is going to keep the Bank at bay . 
the Bank of England was given the power to determine monetary policy shortly after the Labour party took control at the May 1 election . 
Brown raised interest rates by 1 / 4 point to 6.25 percent before ceding power to the Bank and the Bank &apos;s new Monetary Policy Committee has since raised them again to 6.5 percent .
