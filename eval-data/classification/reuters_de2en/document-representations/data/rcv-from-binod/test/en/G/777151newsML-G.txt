the murder of a Russian businessman who was shot in a Swedish car park could be related to his work in the shipping industry , police said on Monday . 
Yevgeny Golubchik , 46 , was shot several times by a masked man on a mountain bike as he was loading goods into a car at a shopping centre in the southern Swedish town of Malmo around lunchtime on Saturday . 
his 15-year-old son was with him . 
police spokesman Torsten Elofsson said the hunt for the gunman had been unsuccessful so far , despite reports from hundreds of witnesses . 
the motive for the killing was also uncertain . 
&quot; It could be related to his business , &quot; Elofsson told Reuters . 
&quot; One theory is that he had been under surveillance for some time ... and we are interested in tracing a white , small car and a four wheel drive that were seen in the neighbourhood of his house recently . 
Golubchik , who moved to Malmo with his family in 1994 , was one of the owners of a newly established shipping company , NB Shipping Services , based in Malmo . 
Elofsson said he had also been an agent for Russia &apos;s Murmansk Shipping Company but had recently broken his ties with the company .
