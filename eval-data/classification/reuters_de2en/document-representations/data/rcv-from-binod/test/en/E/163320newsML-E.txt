third world economies have become more vulnerable in the march to free global trade , and many are not benefitting from the current recovery from recession , Indian Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda said on Sunday . 
in an address to a three-day Group of 15 ( G-15 ) summit in Zimbabwe , Gowda accused the rich West of not reciprocating the Third World &apos;s considerable contribution to trade liberalisation . 
&quot; The promise of trade benefits has not been realised in sectors in which we have an interest and where we have an advantage , &quot; he said , accusing the West of pursuing protectionist policies . 
&quot; Whereas the overall ( global ) outlook is assessed to be good , so far growth has been concentrated in a small number of developing countries and is somewhat uneven . 
&quot; Developing countries are increasingly vulnerable to international financial and trade flows and monetary regimes , as their economies globalise , &quot; he said . 
Gowda urged Third World states to mix free market economics with a strong social responsibility to cater for their poorer populations . 
the G-15 comprises 16 members -- Algeria , Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Jamaica , Malaysia , Mexico , Nigeria , Senegal , Peru , Venezuela , Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe .
