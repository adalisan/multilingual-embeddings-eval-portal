Hungary &apos;s accounting changes are likely to increase the general budget deficit to 5.3 percent of GDP next year from this year &apos;s four percent target , but the change is of a technical nature , Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy said on Wednesday . 
&quot; This means a 5.3 percent deficit next year , but in comparative structure it only corresponds to three percent , &quot; Medgyessy told a conference of municipality officials . 
&quot; The accounting changes between the central state budget and the National Bank of Hungary will not demand any special economic policy steps , &quot; he added . 
the devaluation losses on Hungary &apos;s foreign debt have only appeared in the books of the National Bank of Hungary so far , but from 1997 the general state budget will take over these loans which make the burdens of the budget more transparent , but will not increase them , Medgyessy said . 
the general state budget includes the central state budget , the social security system and other items . 
Medgyessy said Hungary plans to overhaul the social security system as its soaring deficit could make it unfundable next year without urgent reforms . 
he added that the social security deficit could be as high as 60 billion forints this year , compared with a target of 17.8 billion forints .
