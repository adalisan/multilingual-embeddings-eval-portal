Cambodia &apos;s First Prime Minister on Wednesday appeared to reject U.S. efforts to bring Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot before an international tribunal , saying the country should not get involved in Cambodia &apos;s affairs . 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh said the interests of Cambodia were paramount when it came to deciding what should happen to the guerrilla strongman . 
&quot; I am very respectful to China and very respectful to the United States but please don &apos;t get involved in our internal affairs , &quot; the prince told reporters . 
&quot; Everything must be done in conformity with the interests of Cambodia and the people of Cambodia , &quot; Ranariddh said . 
he did not elaborate . 
the United States was studying ways of bringing Pol Pot to trial on genocide charges , assuming he can be taken into custody , State Department officials said on Tuesday . 
China hinted on Tuesday it was opposed to the idea . 
a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Pol Pot &apos;s fate was an internal affair . 
&quot; It should be decided by Cambodians themselves without foreign interference , &quot; Chinese Foreign Minstry spokesman cui Tiankai told reporters in Beijing . 
political analysts said China might be cool to an airing of information about its own dealings with Pol Pot . 
Beijing was a key supporter of the Khmer Rouge 1975-79 &quot; killing fields &quot; regime . 
the Pol Pot government was overthrown in early 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion . 
China continued to support the Khmer Rouge and two smaller non-communist guerrilla armies , including royalist forces , who together formed a &quot; coalition government &quot; and battled the Vietnamese army of occupation a Hanoi-backed government in Phnom Penh . 
the war was officially ended with a 1991 treaty , but the Khmer Rouge subsequently reneged on the peace process . 
Ranariddh said negotiations on the fate of Pol Pot were continuing on Wednesday with the Khmer Rouge splinter faction which turned against their ageing leader and detained him last week . 
Ranariddh said on Wednesday a negotiator was at the Anlong Veng stronghold in northern Cambodia where Pol Pot was being detained but said there was no time-frame for his hand-over to the government . 
Ranariddh said the previous day that the Khmer Rouge splinter faction holding Pol Pot had to hand him over within days if it wanted to strike an amnesty deal with the government . 
last Saturday the prince and his co-premier Hun Sen announced that Pol Pot , mastermind of the &quot; Killing Fields &quot; regime , had been captured by his former comrades . 
the two premiers said he should be brought before an international tribunal and said they had written a letter to the secretary general of the United Nations seeking the world body &apos;s help in bringing to justice those responsible for deaths during the period . 
more than one million Cambodians are estimated to have died from starvation , hard labour , torture or executions during Pol Pot &apos;s rule . 
in their letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters , the two premiers said they were aware of the U.N. &apos; s response to genocide and crimes against humanity in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia -- a reference to tribunals set up by the U.N. Security Council -- and asked for similar help . 
&quot; We believe that crimes of this magnitude are of concern to all persons in the world , as they greatly diminish respect for the most basic human right , the right to life , &quot; the two premiers said in their letter .
