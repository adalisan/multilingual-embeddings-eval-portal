Dutch shares surged on Tuesday to hit a new record with the main market index surpassing the level of 750-points for the first time . 
dealers said investors had high expectations of the 1996 results season , with Hagemeyer and ABN AMRO jumping ahead of their results on Wednesday and Thursday respectively and DSM gaining despite lower results for 1996 . 
&quot; Those results were as expected , but the good news for investors was the fact that DSM is paying a higher 1996 dividend , despite the lower result , &quot; said one dealer . 
analysts have forecast a 44 percent increase in Hagemeyer &apos;s 1996 net to 279 million guilders on Wednesday . 
dealers said the stock was not hurt by today &apos;s somewhat disappointing results from Ceteco in which Hagemeyer has a 70 percent stake . 
Ceteco shares fell 9.00 guilders to 103.00 . 
Financials were strong . 
dealers said banks and insurers were boosted by a favourable outlook for the bond market . 
&quot; Fundamentals in the bond market seem good , &quot; said one dealer . 
Aegon and Fortis Amev also set new records . 
dealers said Unilever outperformed the market today after DSM had expressed an interest in Unilever &apos;s speciality chemicals units which Unilever has recently put up for sale . 
&quot; This was the main reason for the stock to get a lift to a new record , &quot; said one dealer . 
Unilever gained 9.30 to 369.90 . 
dealers said the index was not likely to continue its sprint tomorrow . 
&quot; shares are likely to open at flat levels , &quot; said one .
