Danoli , blessed by a priest and worshipped by the Irish , could raise the roof if he lands Thursday &apos;s Cheltenham Gold Cup . 
for Ireland &apos;s national hero , who recovered from a fractured fetlock to become a potential steeplechasing star , will send legions of race fans delirious with joy if he captures jump racing &apos;s most cherished prize . 
but big ifs still abound for the doughty Danoli , who was blessed by the local priest in the Irish village of Bagenalstown before the biggest test of his rollercoaster career . 
captain Christy was the last novice to win chasing &apos;s Blue Riband back in 1974 . 
the do-or-die Danoli has come to grief twice in six attempts over fences , not a perfect recipe for Cheltenham . 
but last time out he was at his very best , beating with authority two previous Gold Cup winners , Jodami and Imperial Call . 
imperial Call , the 1996 winner , also represents Ireland along with Dorans Pride , like Danoli a novice of huge potential . 
but Imperial Call , trained by one-legged Korean War veteran Fergie Sutherland , has been dogged by setbacks while Dorans Pride , who twice nearly died of colic , may not even run if the ground dries up too much . 
however , if he takes his chance and jumps well , he will be a powerful force . 
the home team rely on the fast improving Coome Hill , front-running course specialist Dublin flyer and the dual King George VI winner One Man , the enigma of the race who has never sparkled at Cheltenham . 
the great event has always eluded prolific master trainer Martin pipe . 
this time he thinks he might have found the answer in the ex-staying hurdler Cyborgo . 
his strong second string is Challenger Du Luc who adores the stiff Cheltenham course . 
Blunt-spoken jockey Graham Bradley overslept last year before a training gallop and was replaced on then-reigning Champion hurdle winner Alderbrook . 
but time proved a great healer as &quot; Brad &quot; picked up the spare ride on Collier Bay who strode to victory up the stamina-sapping Cheltenham hill . 
he won &apos;t be caught napping again and if the ground doesn &apos;t dry up too much on Tuesday , Collier Bay looks the form choice for the hurdling crown . 
but Make A Stand , breathtaking all-the-way winner of the hotly contested Tote Gold trophy , is improving fast and could deny Collier Bay . 
Ireland plays its strongest hand in the Champion hurdle for many years . 
I &apos;m Supposin is a top-class recruit from the flat like previous winners Royal Gait and Alderbrook . 
trainer Kevin Prendergast is oozing confidence . 
space trucker is improving and has attracted wads of ante-post cash while Irish Champion hurdle winner Cockney lad could pull a surprise at 40-1 . 
Wednesday &apos;s Two Mile Champion Chase is shaping up into a another jumping thriller where fluency over the daunting Cheltenham fences could prove crucial . 
Klairon Davis , yet another Irish star , hopes to repeat last year &apos;s victory but the battling Viking flagship is right back to form and ready to recapture his crown . 
bookmakers reckon up to 100 million pounds ( $ 160 million ) could be wagered on the three-day extravaganza , marred last year by the death of 10 horses in its fiercely competitive races . 
animal rights activists have vowed to protest at this year &apos;s meeting where the cream of Ireland and Britain &apos;s best jumpers will be battling for 1 million pounds in prize money . 
and if the Irish come out on top , then expect the smoke- filled racecourse bars to be awash with Guinness stout as the conquering heroes from across the Irish Sea celebrate in their own inimitable style .
