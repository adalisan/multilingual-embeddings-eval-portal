an African-American summit at which U.S. companies pledged to invest billions of dollars in the world &apos;s poorest continent had an emotional ending on Friday . 
the charismatic Reverend Leon Sullivan , the driving force behind the summit , delivered a fevered speech calling on black Americans to help Africa . 
&quot; This is a great day in African history , we are united again ! 
this is a call for African-Americans to wake up and help your homeland as the Poles help Poland , the Irish help Ireland and the Jews help Israel , &quot; he cried . 
amid the fervour , African leaders kept up the pressure for U.S. trade and investment to overtake aid to the continent . 
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe , who also heads the Organisation of African Unity , rounded off Africa &apos;s appeals saying : &quot; Our objective is no less than to help integrate Africa into the mainstream of the world economy . 
Sullivan , a retired U.S. Baptist preacher best known for his Sullivan Principles which laid down guidelines for U.S. firms in apartheid South Africa , told black Americans to jumpstart Africa &apos;s hoped-for prosperity . 
&quot; It is time that African-Americans stop just talking about black pride , and black power , and shaking their fists , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It is time to get together to help ourselves , to help at home and to help in Africa . 
we complain too much ! 
Sullivan also made a blunt appeal to African leaders . 
&quot; I call on African leaders to do even more and more to help your own people , to practise good governance and democracy -- and to stop lining your own pockets ! 
the children of Africa must take precendence over anything else . 
earlier , U.S. President Bill Clinton &apos;s envoy assured the 30-odd African countries represented at the summit of his support , pledging to convince American business of the continent &apos;s potential as a trading partner . 
&quot; My objective is to persuade them to invest in Africa , &quot; Transportation Secretary Ronald Slater told Reuters . 
&quot; The potential of sub-Saharan Africa is immense . 
corporate America , represented at the four-day summit by several fortune 500 companies , pledged this week to deliver hard-cash deals on the promise of continuing political and economic reforms . 
Chevron Corp led the field with a commitment to invest nearly $ 10.5 billion within five years in Africa and Owens Corning , already active in Botswana and South Africa , said it was in negotiations with Zimbabwe for a joint $ 10 million project . 
Coca-Cola said it expected to double its business in Africa in the next five years while software group Microsoft Corp said it was planning to invest &quot; millions of dollars &quot; to expand its business in Africa .
