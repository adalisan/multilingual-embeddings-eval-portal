Afghanistan &apos;s hardline Islamic Taleban militia launched an assault on Saturday on a valley where ousted government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood is bottled up with his forces , witnesses said . 
they said the Taleban fired volleys of rockets at Masood &apos;s positions high on the sides of the gorge which leads into the Panjsher and at least 50 black-turbanned Taleban warriors were seen scaling the rocky hillside heading for the ridge top . 
the Taleban leadership had told Masood to surrender or be expelled from the valley after they stormed into Kabul on Friday last week . 
they pursued him north from the capital to the town of Golbahar , which stands at the mouth of the Panjsher , 70 km ( 44 miles ) north of Kabul . 
two rockets fired from inside the valley on Saturday overshot the Taleban &apos;s mobile rocket launchers by some 200 metres ( yards ) , but the firing was the only sign of resistance from Masood &apos;s men , the witnesses said . 
Masood &apos;s defence of the valley against repeated Soviet assaults in the 1980s won him a reputation as one of the best guerrilla chiefs in the war against the then Moscow-backed communist government . 
Abdur Razzaq , commander of the Taleban forces which swept north from Kabul and bottled up the Panjsher , said on Tuesday a letter had been sent to Masood demanding he surrender or face attack . 
Masood this week declared a state of emergency in the Panjsher Valley and ordered an evacuation in anticipation of an attack . 
hundreds of women , children and the elderly have been fleeing the valley to head for safety into territory controlled by the Taleban .
