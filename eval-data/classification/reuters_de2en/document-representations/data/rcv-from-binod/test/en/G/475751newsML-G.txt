Israel , embroiled in daily street battles with Palestinians , now faces a bigger challenge to Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem -- an Arab League call for its members to suspend steps toward normal relations with it . 
stone-throwing Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers on Sunday in the West Bank for the 11th day since Israel broke ground this month on a new Jewish settlement at a hilltop called Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic or Har Homa in Hebrew . 
Israel &apos;s High Court approved the army demolition of the West Bank home of an Islamist suicide bomber who killed himself and three Israelis in Tel Aviv on March 21 . 
Israeli security sources said demolition of the house could take place within 24 hours , a move that could fuel clashes . 
the settlement building and suicide bombing have plunged Israel-Palestinian relations to one of their lowest points since a 1993 interim peace deal . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday again accused the Palestinian Authority of encouraging terrorism in an interview with CBS television . 
the Authority denies the charge . 
Israeli soldiers on Sunday shot and wounded one Palestinian with live ammunition and wounded at least 37 others with rubber bullets , Palestinian hospital officials said . 
the army said one soldier was slightly wounded by a stone as was an Israeli woman . 
police in Jerusalem said there were several stone-throwing incidents in the city . 
three Israelis were injured when a bus was stoned . 
they said in another incident two policemen were injured . 
three Palestinians were arrested for throwing stones . 
the incidents were not as bad as Israel had feared they would be after one Palestinian was killed on Saturday in clashes with troops , the first fatality in the unrest . 
it had also worried that Land Day , an annual day of protests by Israeli Arabs against land confiscation , might bring a surge in violence . 
police said 25 Israeli Arabs were arrested for stone- throwing in scattered incidents but that Land Day mass rallies were peaceful . 
&quot; I think the majority of the Palestinian forces , policemen , were working with us against the violence in the area , &quot; Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said of the West Bank . 
&quot; Israeli Arabs and their leaders deserve full credit , &quot; Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani separately told reporters . 
&quot; They behaved like mature citizens of Israel . 
but the congratulatory mood was soon dispelled by the Arab League &apos;s decision late on Sunday recommending member countries suspend steps toward relations with Israel and reactivate the Arab boycott over the new settlement . 
Netanyahu , speaking to CBS before the decision was taken , said he doubted Arab states would cut ties because &quot; it would cost them as much as it would cost us &quot; . 
after the decision , Foreign Ministry spokesman Ygal Palmor told Reuters : 
&quot; normal neighbourly relations and regional co-operation are supposed to be an asset and a common interest for all countries in this region . 
&quot; It is absurd that they are being deemed as a whip , so to speak , to be used against Israel whenever there is a crisis in the peace process .
