the United States pledged on Friday to work with European states to send a mission to Serbia quickly to take up President Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s offer to let foreign observers look into disputed local elections . 
but the State Department charged that Milosevic , in a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher , had failed to address U.S. concerns over the Nov . 17 polls cancelled by Belgrade after the opposition claimed sweeping victories . 
Milosevic offered on Friday to let observers from the 54-member Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) check the fairness of the election , whose annulment has sparked major demonstrations in Serbia and protests abroad . 
&quot; Our next step will be to work closely with the OSCE in Vienna to determine the parameters of an OSCE mission to Belgrade and to expedite this process so that this mission may be sent as soon as possible , &quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said . 
&quot; It &apos;s necessary , we think , for the mission to be undertaken quickly , &quot; Burns told a news briefing . 
but he added that its terms must be acceptable to the OSCE . 
he said Washington had suggested privately to Serbia immediately after the poll dispute erupted that an OSCE team should investigate . 
he said the United States would judge Milosevic by the degree of cooperation he gave the observers . 
in Vienna , the OSCE said the Serbian invitation did not specifically invite the mission to check the results and that this would in any case be impossible a month after the elections took place . 
spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said a team could , however , meet all parties and make recommendations on ways out of the crisis . 
the OSCE said its outgoing chairman-in-office , Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti , would reply to Belgrade soon . 
Milosevic &apos;s letter to Christopher , made public in Belgrade , protested that Serbia had a healthy democracy and accused the opposition Zajedno coalition of &quot; political terrorism &quot; . 
burns said the letter &quot; fails to address in any serious and committed way the substantive concerns that the United States has raised &quot; in recent weeks over the annulment of the elections and subsequent police abuse of demonstrators . 
&quot; The United States rejects President Milosevic &apos;s legalistic arguments in this letter that try to whitewash the simple truth , &quot; the spokesman said . 
&quot; There has been a blatant disregard of the democratic will of the Serbian people and the Serbian government has annulled elections which now should be restored , which the opposition clearly won in 15 of 18 constituencies . 
burns said the OSCE mission should be led by &quot; a prominent and eminent international figure , &quot; although Washington had no one in particular in mind . 
its mandate should be to look both at the elections and at the freedom of the Serbian media , most of which are under the control or influence of Milosevic &apos;s socialists . 
burns praised a trip to Belgrade this week by Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini , who has been sharply criticised by the Serbian opposition for urging them to back away from their demands . 
Dini had sent Milosevic &quot; a very tough and unambiguous message &quot; that he risked complete isolation from Europe and North America if he did not reverse the annulment of the election results , the U.S. spokesman said .
