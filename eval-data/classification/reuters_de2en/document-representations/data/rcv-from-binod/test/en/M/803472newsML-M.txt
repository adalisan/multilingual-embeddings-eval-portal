IPE futures were expected to soften initially on Friday , with gas oil facing a $ 1.50 loss on the open and October Brent a five cent fall , brokers said . 
but opinions diverged on the pattern of the day ahead , with some sure of further gains to add to this week &apos;s gasoline inspired rally and others believing the U.S. market leaders strength had faded . 
October Brent ended Thursday eight cents down at $ 19.08 a barrel after NYMEX unleaded shrank back from early gains , while gas oil ended up $ 3.75 at $ 173.75 a tonne , near the day &apos;s highs . 
assumption Day holidays in Europe will quieten business . 
brokers also anticipated a post-expiry lull . 
the expiring September contract finished 20 cents higher on the day at $ 19.19 a barrel on Thursday . 
those who anticipated some profit taking and a fall in the London crude contract rested their belief on the failure of gasoline to breach important targets , coming off highs of 67.40 cents a gallon to end just 0.25 cents higher at 66.33 a gallon . 
&quot; The key thing is that gasoline fought an overhead resistance and came back down , &quot; one broker said . 
but U.S. market players said they anticipated a rise after Thursday &apos;s consolidation , adding to the upward move from 62.05 cents on Monday . 
their views were backed by those in London eyeing a tangle of supports for Brent in the $ 18.60- $ 18.85 region and the U.S. market &apos;s healthy appetite for European gasoline imports . 
&quot; I still think we have got a bit more on the upside , so I &apos;ll be looking to buy any dips , &quot; said one broker . 
the effect of resumed Iraqi exports was being downplayed on both sides of the Atlantic , with their return already largely factored into futures pricing , dealers said .
