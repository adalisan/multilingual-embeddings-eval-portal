notorious criminal Charles Sobhraj , who arrived in France early on Tuesday after 20 years in Indian prisons , was formally placed under investigation for poisoning but set free , his lawyer said . 
lawyer Jacques Verges told reporters outside the lawcourts in the north Paris suburb of Bobigny that Judge Franck Zientara opened the probe over accusations made by an unnamed French woman who claims she was the target of a poisoning attempt in India in 1976 . 
Zientara must now verify whether poisoning charges come under France &apos;s statute of limitations . 
nicknamed &quot; The Snake &quot; , Sobhraj was charged in India with a long string of offences including murder and robbery . 
he was first arrested for holding up a hotel jewellery shop in India in 1971 . 
Sobhraj landed in France at 6 : 40 a.m. ( 0440 GMT ) on Tuesday aboard Air France flight 147 at Charles de Gaulle airport from New Delhi . 
India ordered him deported in February but France initially refused to accept him pending checks on his claim to French citizenship . 
Sobhraj was born to an Indian father and a Vietnamese mother .
