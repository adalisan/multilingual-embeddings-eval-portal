Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Wednesday he thought Italian interest rates were very high given the recent sharp fall in inflation . 
preliminary data released earlier this week from 11 cities pointed to inflation dropping to 1.7 percent year-on-year this month from 2.2 percent in March . 
&quot; We have inflation under two percent and rates which are incredibly high , &quot; Prodi told a rally in this central Italian town . 
&quot; When between 1964 and 1967 inflation was low , between two and three percent , the discount rate was 3.5 percent . 
in countries which have similar inflation to Italy , the discount rate is 3.5 percent . 
we have a rate of 6.75 percent . 
we have room for improvement .
