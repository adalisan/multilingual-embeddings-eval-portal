a winter-like storm forecast to hit the U.S. Plains early next week could lift asking prices for Nebraska feedlot cattle , feedlot sources said . 
cold and snow were forecast to reach Nebraska Tuesday , and feedlot sources said severe weather could stress cattle and delay marketings . 
Feedlots may raise asking prices from this week &apos;s trades of $ 108.00 to $ 109.00 per cwt on a dressed basis . 
next week &apos;s showlists will be about unchanged from this week &apos;s , they said . 
&quot; If the weather doesn &apos;t knock a bunch of cattle off the list , it will be about steady with this week , &quot; he said .
