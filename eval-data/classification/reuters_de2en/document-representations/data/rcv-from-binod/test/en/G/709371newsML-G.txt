Khmer Rouge front man Khieu Samphan said on Sunday that he supported the Cambodian constitution , in effect adding support to royalist First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh who has been negotiating with the rebels . 
Ranariddh said late last month that the negotiations could not move forward until the guerrillas recognised the constitution and officially broke all ties with reviled rebel leader Pol Pot . 
the announcement on the rebels &apos; clandestine radio came as fighting between forces loyal to Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen continued in the capital , with gunfire echoing above the city streets . 
Khieu Samphan ( corrects from &quot; Ranariddh &quot; ) also said Pol Pot &apos;s reign was over . 
&quot; The regime and organisation of ( rebel leader ) Pol Pot has ended , &quot; Khieu Samphan said in the broadcast monitored in Phnom Penh . 
Khieu Samphan , the guerrilla group &apos;s main political leader , said his National Solidarity Party recognised and would defend the constitution . 
Khieu Samphan and other top Khmer Rouge figures broke with Pol Pot in May after a violent falling out among the group &apos;s top leaders . 
the fighting in the capital began on Saturday after Hun Sen said his forces had to take action against defectors from the Khmer Rouge smuggled into the capital by Ranariddh . 
Ranariddh denied bringing Khmer Rouge into the city , although he has been negotiating with the rebels and hinted he would be willing to form a political alliance with Khieu Samphan . 
Hun Sen declared all negotiations with the guerrilla group illegal . 
he has been trying to prevent any linkup between Ranariddh and Khieu Samphan which could strengthen his rival &apos;s position . 
Ranariddh &apos;s negotiations with the rebels inflamed an already-bitter power sharing row with Hun Sen that left the government deadlocked for months . 
Ranariddh said in a statment issued from France on Saturday he had become head of Cambodia &apos;s only legitimate government as a result of what he said was a coup attempt by Hun Sen. 
political analysts say an alliance between Khieu Samphan and Ranariddh would bolster the prince both politically and militarily though most Khmer Rouge forces are in remote northern and northwestern parts of the country . 
the Khmer Rouge , responsible for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians during their 1975-79 &quot; killing fields &quot; rule , have been waging a low-intestity war against the coalition government since rejecting a U.N.-run peace process and boycotting elections in 1993 . 
the guerrilla force has in recent years been decimated by government offensives , defections and splits .
