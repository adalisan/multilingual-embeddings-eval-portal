Jordan on Saturday stepped up its campaign of accusations that Iraq was involved in the kingdom &apos;s worst unrest in seven years , citing evidence gathered from pro-Baghdad detainees . 
the new allegations were made a day after an official source said Jordan had asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave because he was carrying out duties &quot; incompatible with diplomatic norms &quot; , implying he was accused of spying . 
Jordan &apos;s mass-circulation state-controlled newspapers ran headlines implicating Iraq in the unrest , which erupted last weekend after the government doubled bread prices under radical economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund . 
King Hussein and Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti have blamed the trouble on Iraq and a local-pro Baghdad party . 
but government attempts to link the rioting to foreign influence has been treated with derision by many politicians and those in the streets who blame the protests on severe economic hardships and rising poverty and unemployment . 
&quot; We have written confessions from detainees that point to the involvement of official Iraqi parties in instigating the unrest , &quot; a senior government official , who requested anonymity , told Reuters on Saturday . 
security forces have arrested scores of leaders and members of the Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party ( JASBP ) since trouble flared in the party &apos;s traditional bastion in the southern town of Karak eight days ago and spread to nearby towns before reaching an area in downtown Amman . 
the party , which has one deputy in the 80-seat parliament and maintains strong links with Iraq &apos;s ruling Baath party of President Saddam Hussein , has denied involvement in the unrest . 
&quot; We have established facts that orders were issued by Iraq &apos;s Baath party to use the bread issue to stir trouble to hit back at the king and the government for their anti-Iraq policies , &quot; the Jordanian official said . 
an investigation was under way and those behind the unrest would be exposed once it was over , he said . 
&quot; We will not sit on it or cover up the results . 
the king has been calling for change in Baghdad since top Iraqi defections to Jordan a year ago . 
Kabariti has been the point man in the king &apos;s confrontation with Iraq , his main Arab ally before the 1990-91 Gulf crisis . 
the official also confirmed reports that Amman banned Khaled Rashid Misleh from coming to Jordan to take up his post as the new first secretary at the Iraqi embassy in Amman &quot; because we found out he was an Iraqi intelligence officer &quot; . 
officials have hinted the government might dissolve the JASBP for violating Jordanian laws and ask Iraq to reduce the number of Iraqi diplomats in Jordan , said to be over 20 . 
three Jordanian diplomats man Amman &apos;s mission in Baghdad . 
meanwhile , the army withdrew its heavy presence from Karak and lifted a curfew on its residents with the return of order , residents and officials said . 
armoured vehicles that had ringed Karak and deployed along most of the old city &apos;s inner roads were pulled out at dawn , hours after the main Friday prayers , the starting point of last week &apos;s troubles , passed peacefully . 
officials said a tight curfew imposed since August 17 was lifted at five a.m. ( 0200 GMT ) and authorities began releasing scores of detainees who demonstraterd but did not take part in damaging government buildings or inciting unrest . 
&quot; Those who were involved in torching buildings and in instigating trouble will be sent to court , &quot; said one official .
