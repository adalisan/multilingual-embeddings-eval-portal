the Canadian Wheat Board sold a minimum 150,000 tonnes of feed barley to Saudia Arabia at US $ 145 a tonne fob Vancouver , trade sources said on Tuesday . 
two ships loaded barley in Vancouver and a third loaded barley in thunder Bay to supply Saudi Arabia , sources said . 
&quot; They must have sold a minimum 150,000 tonnes . 
these are all sold relatively cheap , &quot; a trade source said . 
Saudi Arabia tendered on Monday for 450,000 tonnes of optional-origin barley to be delivered to Jeddah and 250,000 tonnes to Dammam , both by July 15 . 
&quot; Canada &apos;s going to be in a better position to supply August , September . 
I think Europe &apos;s going to be the biggest participant on this one , &quot; another trade source said . 
&quot; It &apos;s to do with exportable surplus , we just can &apos;t provide three , four to five hundred thousand tonnes in that position , &quot; the source said . 
the CWB tendered one 50,000 tonne May shipment contract last week to its accredited exporters . 
&quot; They made it available because they weren &apos;t making the sales to Japan .
