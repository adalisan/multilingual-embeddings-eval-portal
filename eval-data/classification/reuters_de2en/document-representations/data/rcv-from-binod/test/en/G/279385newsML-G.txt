Serbia &apos;s daily pro-democracy demonstrations have settled into a precarious ritual of police bottling up protesters until they get tired and go home while President Slobodan Milosevic mulls unpalatable options . 
if he cracks down hard with police and loyalists from the provinces to get protesters off Belgrade &apos;s streets , Serbian-led Yugoslavia &apos;s campaign to rejoin Europe and gain Western financial aid is lost . 
if he yields to the recommendations of an OSCE factfinding mission and reinstates opposition victories in municipal voting annulled last month , a half century of socialist rule could start unravelling . 
with it would go the stranglehold of Socialist Party ( SPS ) members on every meaningful job in a warped state economy bled dry by corrupt apparatchiks and war profiteers . 
Milosevic could play for time by turning over Belgrade and 14 other large towns won by the opposition and then swiftly hold new elections to restore SPS omnipotence . 
state-run media , now harping on an alleged &quot; foreign hand &quot; behind the protesters to restimulate xenophobia that helped preserve SPS power after communism collapsed elsewhere in Eastern Europe , would try to undermine voter desire for change . 
but analysts believe the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition has become so prominent , and the fate of Yugoslavia &apos;s shambolic economy so dependent on Western favour , that one-party domination may well be nearing an end . 
&quot; This tyrant has simply all of a sudden found himself on unknown territory , where he is no longer even sure of the law of gravitation , &quot; Stojan Cerovic , columnist for the independent weekly Vreme , wrote of Milosevic . 
&quot; If Yugoslavia rejects OSCE recommendations , then political pressure on Yugoslavia will ensue ( by economic means ) , &quot; said foreign relations analyst Ljubivoje Acimovic . 
&quot; The West has suggested to Belgrade to address the OSCE as a way of coming out of a blind alley . 
the West has an interest in saving Yugoslavia , to put circumstances in this region in order , &quot; he added in a Vreme interview . 
&quot; We shall find ourselves in an extremely difficult situation , both Yugoslavia and the European Union , if we allow this chance to slip by . 
the six-week-old daily demonstrations , drawing as many as a quarter of a million people at their peak , were peaceful and good-natured until Milosevic summoned 40,000 loyalists from the provinces into Belgrade on December 24 to confront Zajedno . 
some 50 people were injured in a melee between Zajedno and SPS supporters . 
the government then banned street marches . 
Zajedno and allied students have defiantly continued to gather daily and try to march but police swiftly divert them into pedestrian malls and block them until they disperse . 
the rallies have ominously turned violence-prone in a sign of Europe &apos;s last essentially communist leadership backed into a corner by a combination of domestic and foreign pressure . 
another 29 people were hurt on Friday in scuffles with police . 
a dozen journalists , most working for foreign agencies , have been beaten by police and their cameras smashed . 
analysts believe Milosevic will have to yield at least somewhat to stave off utter collapse of the economy soon . 
Yugoslavia needs big infusions of Western aid to ward off renewed hyper-inflation and the United States and EU allies have warned Belgrade none will come without democratic reform . 
most workers are on indefinite leave , paid but only with pittances , and most Yugoslavs must moonlight to survive . 
many state employees , including police , as well as pensioners have not been paid for months . 
but while the economy is dreadful , the SPS still has strong cards to play as it prepares for more significant parliamentary and presidential elections in 1997 , analysts say . 
even if the opposition takes over municipalities , the SPS central government could make them look inept by denying them funding or weakening communal powers through legislation . 
there are also private doubts here and abroad about the competence and credentials of some opposition leaders who backed the ultra-nationalist Bosnian Serbs in war even after Milosevic ditched them to mend fences with the West . 
further , Zajedno has failed to evolve into a truly mass movement , beyond better-educated urbanites , because workers and farmers , long the bedrock of the Yugoslav state , have not joined the demonstrations in an organised way . 
most are too busy trying to make ends meet or kept faithful to SPS rule by state television and radio which monopolise the media landscape outside the capital Belgrade , where independent journalists flourish despite official harassment .
