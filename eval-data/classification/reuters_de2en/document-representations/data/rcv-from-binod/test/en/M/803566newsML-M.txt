discouraged by weak Japanese stocks and low interest rates at home , Japanese individual investors have little choice but to keep their funds invested abroad , underwriters and dealers said on Friday . 
a total of 133 billion yen ( $ 1.12 billion ) worth of dual-currency samurai bonds issued about two years ago is scheduled to mature from August until the end of the year , but those funds are not expected to return home , they said . 
they added that investment in foreign bonds remains strong even after the dollar &apos;s plunge in May , and continued fund outflows could become a factor capping the yen . 
&quot; Japanese investors &apos; funds , which went abroad for investment in dual-currency bonds and foreign bonds , will stay there as long as the stock market says in a slump , &quot; said Takashi Toyahara , chief dealer at Nippon Credit Bank . 
Toyahara said that , with the 225-share Nikkei average staying well below the 21,000 level and showing no clear signs of bouncing back , foreign bonds and dual-currency bonds are likely to remain the key investment products that Japanese securities houses offer to retail investors . 
&quot; Who would be interested in buying the 10-year ( Japanese government bonds ) with a rate of about two percent or buy stocks that have been weak for the past nine months ? 
&quot; he said . 
&quot; Private investors would rather take risks with currencies than invest in domestic instruments . 
the dollar &apos;s sudden reversal against the yen in May forced individual investors to swallow heavy losses . 
but some investors are starting to regain confidence in the dollar and , as a result , are buying dual-currency bonds again . 
&quot; Foreign investment interest still remains strong , but investors have become extra-cautious about forex risks after they were burned by the dollar &apos;s nosedive in May , &quot; said Masaru Hamazaki , deputy manager at Yamaichi Research Institute . 
to meet such demand , Japanese brokerages have devised dual-currency bonds which contain less currency risk at the time of maturity , by fixing the level of the dollar at a lower level than the actual market level . 
the underwriters said that the break-even point for bonds of this sort issued recently was set at a dollar rate around 100 to 105 yen , instead of the prevailing rate , in return for buyers &apos; acceptance of a lower coupon rate . 
after the number of fresh dual-currency samurai issues fell to zero in June for the first time since August 1995 , companies and other institutions are beginning to issue those bonds again , underwriters said . 
about 115 billion yen ( $ 974 million ) worth of yen / U.S. 
dollar dual-currency samurai bonds was launched in July and August in five tranches , underwriters said . 
an underwriter at a major Japanese brokerage said 30 billion yen ( $ 254 million ) worth of yen / dollar dual samurai bonds issued by Finnish Export Credit and 10 billion yen ( $ 84.7 million ) worth of bonds issued by Dutch insurer Aegon NV were sold out shortly after sales began in August . 
&quot; The bonds were well-absorbed by private investors . 
the bonds were designed to protect investors from currency risks at maturity and apparently they appreciated that very much , &quot; the underwriter said . 
&quot; People were still interested in buying ( dual-currency samurai bonds ) with a coupon of at least three percent with smaller currency risks , &quot; the underwriter said . 
currency dealers and underwriters said that it is still too early to determine whether dual-currency samurais have come back in vogue , but the trend could pick up if the outlook for the dollar turns bullish .
