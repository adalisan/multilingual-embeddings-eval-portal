Mohammad Khatami , who takes over as Iran &apos;s president next week , is a moderate clergyman whose peculiar mixture of credentials enabled him to beat the odds and score the biggest political upset of Iran &apos;s 18-year-old revolution . 
his reputation as an open-minded Shi &apos;ite Moslem intellectual and a tolerant politician gained him the electoral support of a coalition ranging from Western-style liberals to radical Islamists , including some senior clerics . 
in the May 23 election Khatami , 54 , trounced the clerical establishment &apos;s candidate and pre-election favourite , conservative parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri . 
his triumph was due to wide backing by women , young people and intellectuals who feared a harder application of Islamic rules in everyday life and limits on freedom of expression . 
his campaign was endorsed by centrists close to outgoing President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Islamist left-wingers who in recent years have moderated many of their views . 
this unlikely coalition was formed to counter conservatives accused by Khatami &apos;s supporters of trying to monopolise state power by adding the presidency to their control of parliament . 
Khatami &apos;s moderate views have cost him dearly in the past . 
in 1992 , he was forced to resign after serving about 10 years as minister of culture and Islamic guidance -- under pressure from conservatives who attacked his relatively liberal policies which allowed books and films to flourish . 
but his outspoken views , which include favouring more personal freedom , democracy and the rule of law , have been shielded by his religious credentials . 
born in Ardakan , a town on the edge of Iran &apos;s central desert , he is the son of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khatami , a respected cleric in the region who joined the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini &apos;s movement which deposed the U.S.-backed Shah in 1979 . 
after the revolution , Khomeini appointed Khatami &apos;s father as the top clerical official in Ardakan and later in the provincial capital of Yazd . 
the younger Khatami himself undertook Islamic studies in the Shi &apos;ite religious learning centre of Qom where he also joined Khomeini &apos;s movement in the early 1960s . 
he established close contacts with Khomeini &apos;s son Ahmad and together they were active in distributing Khomeini &apos;s books and other dissident Islamic material . 
Khatami later received a university degree in philosophy and was appointed by senior clerics to head an Islamic centre in Hamburg , Germany , where he also perfected his German and English before the 1979 revolution . 
a middle-ranking clergyman , he wears a black turban and is titled Seyyed -- signs of a person believed to be a descendant of Islam &apos;s Prophet Mohammad and thus due special respect . 
after his 1992 resignation from the cabinet , Khatami stayed out of the political limelight , working as an adviser to Rafsanjani and heading Iran &apos;s national library . 
his image as an outsider helped Khatami appeal to Iranians at a time when his rival Nateq-Nouri was the candidate clearly identified with the conservative establishment . 
whether Khatami &apos;s credentials will enable him to work smoothly with powerful state bodies dominated by conservatives -- not least parliament itself -- remains to be seen . 
on the foreign policy front , Khatami is not expected to make radical changes to Iran &apos;s stance towards the West , as Iran &apos;s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final say on all key issues from foreign policy to the economy . 
but Khatami triggered controversy by suggesting before the election that Iran could learn from the West and should not isolate itself . 
Khatami is married and has two daughters and a son .
