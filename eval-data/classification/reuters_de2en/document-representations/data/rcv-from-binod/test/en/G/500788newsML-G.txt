Britain &apos;s two main politicial parties tried on Thursday to punch holes in each other &apos;s economic policies to win over voters on the central question of the election -- who can be trusted to run the country ? 
as the six-week campaign for the May 1 election reached its half-way stage , Prime Minister John Major &apos;s Conservatives took heart from a rise in its opinion poll rating to attack one of their Labour opponents &apos; core manifesto commitments . 
labour leader Tony Blair has promised to get 250,000 young unemployed people off welfare and into work by offering employers a 60 pound ( $ 98 ) a week subsidy . 
but Prime Minister John Major , in a relaxed performance at his daily news conference , said companies would simply sack existing workers to make room for others who would cost less because of the subsidy . 
furthermore , Labour &apos;s pledge to introduce a minimum wage and to sign the European Union &apos;s social chapter on workers &apos; rights would throw more young people out of work , he claimed . 
&quot; The truth is : labour would need to have an employment scheme funded by the taxpayer merely to scoop up the young people thrown out of work by their other policies , &quot; Major said . 
&quot; If you are a young person and you want a job , do not trust Labour . 
if you are a parent and you want your son and daughter to have a job , do not trust Labour , &quot; he added . 
earlier , Blair had kept up the attack on Major &apos;s tax record , charging that the Conservatives had repeatedly broken the promise they made at the 1992 election not to raise taxes . 
he challenged Major to confirm the conclusion of a study by the Institute of Fiscal Studies , a respected indepedent think tank , that taxes had risen since 1992 and that the average family was at least seven pounds ( $ 11.36 ) a week worse off . 
&quot; The Tories will not be believed on their promises for the next five years until they have admitted the truth about the last five years , &quot; said Blair , who looked at times to be feeling the pressure . 
Blair shrugged off a MORI poll in Thursday &apos;s Times newspaper showing the Conservatives just 15 points adrift of Labour , compared with 27 points last week . 
the survey gave the ruling party 34 percent support against 49 percent for Labour . 
repeating his mantra that he had never been complacent , Blair said only one poll mattered -- the real one on May 1 . 
Blair &apos;s aides said they had always expected their huge poll lead to narrow in the heat of battle . 
but they also pointed to a separate Gallup poll for Thursday &apos;s Daily Telegraph newspaper giving Labour 53 percent and the Conservatives 30 percent . 
Blair , whose party has been in opposition since 1979 , is convinced he needs to put across a positive case for change and not rely solely on trying to torpedo the Conservatives &apos; record . 
with signs that voters are tiring of the daily slanging matches , Blair ordered Labour &apos;s 10-point &quot; Contract with the British people &quot; to be delivered to every home in the country . 
&quot; The Tory Lie Machine is now moving up a gear , so it is vital that we move up a gear in our positive campaigning . 
the contract is the key to that , &quot; he said .
