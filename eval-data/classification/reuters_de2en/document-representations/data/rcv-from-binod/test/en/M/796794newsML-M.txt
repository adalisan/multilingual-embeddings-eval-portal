volatility in major U.S. stock index options is expected to last at least through Friday &apos;s expiration of August contracts , traders and analysts said Wednesday . 
the day &apos;s session was already shaping up to be one of the choppier ones of late , with stock prices rallying sharply off the opening bell only to fall equally dramatically within the first hour of trading . 
the Dow industrial average lost 22 points to about 7,939 . 
the bellwether barometer had rallied to 8,040 off the opening but quickly fell to a session low of 7,879 . 
one measure of index option volatility , the Chicago Board Options Exchange &apos;s volatility index , which is calculated off certain OEX contracts , was up 1.02 , or about 4.15 percent , at 26.35 . 
it spiked to 27.98 intraday . 
an S &amp; P 500 futures options trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said volatilities had climbed about a point over the last couple of days on a closing basis and more than that on an intraday basis . 
he said one U.S. brokerage firm was selling December calls and buying December puts , which some viewed as a bearish bet on the market &apos;s longer-term outlook . 
but at the CBOE , one SPX options trader said there were solid buyers of out-of-the-money September and December calls , suggesting some investors remained bullish . 
the SPX September 965 call traded nearly 2,800 contracts and the September 995 call traded about 3,950 . 
in the December series , the 970 call traded 685 contracts and the 995 call traded 215 . 
the December 970 put traded 700 contracts . 
Richard Scarlata , editor of the Sutton Advisory Letter , said that while Friday &apos;s expiration may have taken a back seat to the cross-currents driving stocks , it could still be a factor . 
&quot; You really could get a surprise on Thursday or Friday to the downside , &quot; he said . 
he added that for the balance of Wednesday , the last hour of trading will , as has become common , be important . 
several analysts have noted that recently , the market has opened strong only to close at or near its session lows , which is the opposite of bull market tendencies . 
&quot; It is all yet to shake out , &quot; said Scarlata , who expects further selling . 
&quot; If I &apos;m right , you &apos;re going to see real sellers show up this afternoon and we will end near the ( intraday ) lows . 
Moby Waller , an analyst at Investment Research Institute , said that for the OEX , the 900 level has become key because there is relatively heavy open interest in the August 900 puts . 
&quot; That &apos;s been like a magnet this week , &quot; he said , adding that the next key after 900 would be the index &apos;s 20-day moving average , which was at 916.55 Wednesday afternoon .
