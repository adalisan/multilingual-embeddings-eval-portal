a sharp fall in Italy &apos;s lira repo rate to a record minimum of 6.26 percent at today &apos;s Bank of Italy tender is due to technical factors rather than a central bank signal for lower official rates , monetary sources said 
monetary sources told Reuters the fall in the rate was due to technical deadlines in the banking system and banks &apos; treasurers not wanting to borrow for longer than a month . 
&quot; The Bank of Italy only wanted to help the system by compensating for a brief period in which , for technical reasons , banks &apos; liquidity was low , &quot; a monetary source said . 
the Bank of Italy called a 15.0 trillion lire repurchase tender for today or Thursday but received requests for only 11.319 trillion at the operation . 
the minimum rate was 6.26 percent , well below the previous repo rate of 6.90 percent . 
the average rate for the 37-day repo was 6.69 percent compared with 6.93 percent at the previous operation on June 24 . 
on the money markets , one-month rates are around 6.90 percent . 
the repo rate came in well below the 6.75 percent official discount rate instead of just on it or a few basis points above as in recent months . 
the lowest level ever for the minimum rate previously was 6.76 percent on June 9 . 
Wednesday &apos;s repo fanned market speculation the Bank of Italy might be signalling an upcoming interest rate cut , after keeping the discount rate on hold since January despite a sharp slowdown in inflation . 
but monetary sources told Reuters the fall in the rate was due to banks &apos; treasurers not wanting to borrowing for longer than a month . 
given technical deadlines in the banking system on Wednesday and particularly Thursday , the sources said the repo aimed to ease liquidity during a test period for a payment system which would eventually take Italian banking into the European standard TARGET settlement system . 
the test period began on June 23 and they said technical problems related to its start-up had pushed short term rates up . 
one treasurer said the low level of bids at the tender was due to the difficulties experienced by several treasuries in having sufficient securities at their immediate disposal as a result of the change in the system . 
another market operator noted the duration of the repurchase pact was longer than a month . 
&quot; Expectations for a cut in the discount rate are still alive and kicking . 
in a climate like that many people don &apos;t want to tie themselves to such a long term expiry and they prefer to pay the possible overnight cost . 
some treasurers also pointed out that the Bank of Italy had called the repo tender at a slightly earlier time in the day than normal and some operators had missed it as a result . 
the overnight rate stood at 7.02 percent at the end of the morning session while tomorrow / next was at 7.06 percent .
