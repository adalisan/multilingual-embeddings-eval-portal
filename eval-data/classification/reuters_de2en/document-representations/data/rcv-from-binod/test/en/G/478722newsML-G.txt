Brazilian government whips and economy officials were locked in talks over the text of a civil service reform bill due to be put to its first vote in the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday , officials said on Tuesday . 
&quot; The idea is that the vote goes ahead as scheduled tomorrow , &quot; said a spokeswoman for Deputy Benito Gama , the government &apos;s leader in the lower house . 
differences remain over a proposed ceiling on pay and pensions , which would cut the income of many lawmakers and threatens to split the government &apos;s multiparty alliance in Congress , she said . 
planning Ministry officials were calculating the financial cost of exempting lawmakers and other categories of public sector workers from the proposed 10,800-reais ( $ 10,188 ) monthly ceiling on pay and pensions , a ministry spokeswoman said . 
however , Gama &apos;s spokeswoman said the text had not been altered so far . 
civil service reform is considered the most effective way to cut public spending . 
it would enable states and municipalities that spend more than 60 percent of their receipts on payrolls to dismiss workers whose jobs are currently guaranteed . 
the bill was sent to Congress in August 1995 . 
since then , it has proceeded at a snail &apos;s pace in the face of opposition ranging from trade unions to government-allied parties . 
as a constitutional amendment , the bill requires the approval of two three-fifths majority votes in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate .
