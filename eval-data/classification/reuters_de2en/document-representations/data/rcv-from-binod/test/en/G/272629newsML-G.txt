an unbeaten 103 from former South African captain Kepler Wessels was one of few highlights on the final day of India &apos;s drawn three-day cricket match against Eastern Province on Monday . 
Wessels reached his 61st first-class century with a square cut for four off the left arm of Woorkeri Raman -- and promptly declared the Eastern Province first innings closed on 322 for four . 
the 38-year-old Wessels had batted faultlessly for just under four hours and hit 15 fours . 
India then reached 130 for two when the rain-affected match was finally consigned to a draw , with opener Vikram Rathore making a sketchy 64 and Rahul Dravid a solid 50 not out . 
for the Indian cricketers , who were just three days away from the opening test against South Africa in Durban , the last day at St George &apos;s Park gave young fast bowlers David Johnson and Doda Ganesh the chance to press for test selection . 
the two are competing for the third seamer &apos;s berth at Kingsmead behind the new ball duo of Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad but neither looked penetrative on a slow Port Elizabeth surface . 
the 25-year-old Johnson , the shorter of the two , returned unimpressive figures of 1-88 from 19 overs but , with his ability to skid the ball through , he is favoured to earn his second test cap at Kingsmead . 
Eastern Province , on 108 for two going into the final day , progressed comfortably to their declaration 53 minutes before tea . 
opener Philip AMM ( 81 ) and Wessels shared in a third-wicket stand of 112 in 30 overs , with neither batsman in any trouble on the flat , slow pitch . 
Wessels also received confident middle-order support from all-rounder Dave Callaghan , with a belligerent 38 , and former South African test opener Mark Rushmere , with a brisk 32 not out . 
Rushmere &apos;s innings included successive sixes and a total of 17 runs in one over bowled by the slow left arm of Venkatapathy Raju .
