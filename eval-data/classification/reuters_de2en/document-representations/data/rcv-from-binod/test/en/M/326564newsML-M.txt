China &apos;s central government could buy up to 400,000 tonnes of white sugar from the domestic market for its reserves to bolster the country &apos;s flagging sugar prices , sugar traders in Hong Kong and China said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The government should , in the coming 30 days , buy around 400,000 tonnes for their reserves , but the news is not confirmed yet , &quot; said a Hong Kong sugar source . 
other sugar traders said the amount would be between 200,000 tonnes to 300,000 tonnes . 
some traders said the purchases were already under way . 
the price of ex-factory white sugar in Guangxi was quoted at 3,800 yuan ( $ 458 ) a tonne , unchanged from last week . 
the government purchase could possibly prevent a repeat of the situation around this time last year when domestic sugar prices dipped to 3,600 yuan ( $ 434 ) a tonne , shortly after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday , industry sources said . 
but the sources doubted the government buying programme would provide much of a boost to prices . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;ll touch 3,600 yuan ( $ 434 ) a tonne this year , and 4,000 yuan ( $ 482 ) a tonne is a reasonable level , &quot; one sugar trader said . 
he said domestic prices could edge up to 4,100 yuan ( $ 494 ) a tonne after May but 4,400 yuan ( $ 530 ) was unlikely . 
premiums for Thai raw sugar for March / May delivery were quoted at about 0.30 / 0.40 cents ( bid / offer ) per pound over New York &apos;s Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange ( CSCE ) fob basis . 
may / July delivery was quoted at 0.40 / 0.47 cents over New York futures , while July / Sept was 0.70 / 0.85 cents .
