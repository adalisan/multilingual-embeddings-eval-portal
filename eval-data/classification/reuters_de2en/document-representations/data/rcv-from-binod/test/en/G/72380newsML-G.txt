Western Samoa rugby coach Bryan Williams said on Wednesday he was testing the waters by approaching three rugby league players to join his squad for the tour of Britain at the end of October . 
the New Zealand Press Association reported that Williams had approached former All Blacks winger and current Wigan centre va &apos;aiga Tuigamala and former North Harbour and Counties flankers Apollo Perelini and Junior Paramore to join his squad . 
&quot; Their response has been encouraging , but I &apos;m not overly confident of getting them , &quot; Williams said . 
&quot; But unless you try you never know where you stand with these things . 
he said he could not see why Western Samoa , who have lost numerous players to rugby league and New Zealand rugby in recent years , should not ask players to return under the new professional climate . 
&quot; They ( rugby league ) took them from us so I can &apos;t see why we can &apos;t try and get them back , &quot; he said . 
Williams said the major obstacles to the league players turning out for Western Samoa were their contractual obligations . 
&quot; Once we find out where we stand with them this time then we can look at what we need to do the next time around to maybe definitely have them there if they want to play . 
Williams expects to name his touring squad , to be captained North Harbour flanker Pat Lam , by the end of this week . 
the tour will start on about October 28 , thereby avoiding a clash with New Zealand provincial sides contesting the national provincial championship . 
Williams originally planned to name his tour party today but has delayed an announcement until he hears from British rugby clubs which the three league players are involved with in the English league off-season .
