European high sulphur fuel oil barges closed steady on Friday but at the high side of the week &apos;s range while cargoes talked a little weaker with supplies of Russian said to be available on the market , traders said . 
high sulphur barges traded late on Friday at $ 85.50 and $ 85.25 -- or within Thursday &apos;s closing range -- after earlier deals at $ 84 and $ 83.50 . 
late offers were reported in the $ 85.75 / $ 86 range but no deals were heard . 
&quot; The sellers are running away so buying suddenly set in , &quot; one trader said , commenting on the market &apos;s rise in the afternoon . 
some traders said the lower levels earlier in the day were set by some players interested in seeing lower cargo quotes for pricing , while others said that buying interest was dulled by crude &apos;s fall last night . 
low sulphur barges were very quiet , with some sellers holding at the $ 97 mark while others cut their asking price 50 cents to $ 1 , but no buying interest was seen at those levels . 
&quot; I think people may be waiting for prices to drop further with crude , &quot; one Rotterdam-based trader said . 
high sulphur cargoes were offered a little lower , with one trader saying that he cut his price for Russian M-100 cracked to two means flat but buying interest was $ 1.50 to $ 2 lower . 
&quot; There are supplies there , we have a cargo every three days , &quot; the seller said , adding he sold an M-100 cracked cargo on Thursday to a Mediterranean buyer at $ 81 CIF , $ 1 below deals he had last week . 
but other traders said high sulphur would continue to draw strength from the fact that the Russian supplies were being absorbed by the market . 
one percent was also said to be weaker in line with weaker swaps and low buying interest . 
there was unconfirmed talk of a cargo changing hands on Friday at $ 98 CIF or around the $ 88 / $ 89 fob level . 
a buyer who was actively seeking a cargo earlier this week said he withdrew from the market and will be moving two cargoes he picked up earlier to Israel and the Far East . 
only one other buyer was heard on the market .
