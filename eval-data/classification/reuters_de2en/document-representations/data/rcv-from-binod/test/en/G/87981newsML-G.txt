Estonian police said on Tuesday they are holding a man who may be a suspected serial killer who has terrorised the northeastern town of Narva . 
four women were killed and one seriously injured in attacks in the Russian-dominated town of 80,000 over the last month . 
police said they have arrested a 21-year-old unemployed man in connection with an attack last month , when the woman was brutally beaten and died soon after being taken to hospital . 
&quot; We have strong charges against him on this one count and are checking to see if it is related to the other four cases , &quot; a police spokesman told Reuters . 
&quot; The murders seem to have been carried out in a similar way but we cannot be sure yet , &quot; the spokesman added . 
all of the women , aged between 17 and 27 , were beaten , and were left naked or just partially clothed . 
one victim had her ear-rings torn off and a noose made from a stocking tied around her neck .
