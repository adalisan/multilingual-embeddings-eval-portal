the World Trade Organisation announced on Friday it was calling a meeting of ministers from the world &apos;s 48 poorest countries next month in an apparent effort to promote better trading conditions for them . 
the announcement followed a meeting between the WTO &apos;s Director-General Renato Ruggiero and Rubens Ricupero , Secretary-General of the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD , which is helping set up the gathering . 
the WTO said the gathering would be held in Geneva from November 13-15 . 
at a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial powers in Lyon in June Ruggiero called on industrialised countries and richer emerging economies to shape a plan of action on trade concessions to help prevent the 48 sinking deeper into poverty . 
he urged the better off members of the 124-state WTO to commit themselves to removing tariffs and lowering other barriers on a range of exports from the poorest , know as the least-developed countries or LDCs . 
although the response has been generally cool , especially from the United States , Ruggiero has made clear he will press the action plan to try to get agreement formalised at the WTO &apos;s first ministerial meeting in Singapore in December . 
last month he returned to the charge when he told the WTO &apos;s own Committee on Trade and Development that the global trading community had a duty to prevent further marginalisation of the LDCs , most of whom are in Africa . 
and last week he told UNCTAD &apos;s governing board that conditions of poverty in the LDCs were unsustainable in a world &quot; where economic , environmental and demographic problems necessarily have a global effect . 
LDCs are defined by the U.N. as countries where the per capita income is less than $ 600 , a category which includes several Asian countries -- like Bangladesh and war-torn Afghanistan -- as well as island states in the Pacific . 
in 1995 , according to UNCTAD , their share of world trade despite efforts to liberalise their economies was less than 0.4 per cent . 
and they received only two per cent of the global flow of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , a major motor of growth . 
UNCTAD , now working increasingly closely with the WTO which is not part of the U.N. system , has for years promoted the cause of the LDCs and itself has been focussing debate on their plight at the current meeting of its board . 
in Lyon , Ruggiero argued that apart from working for the removal of all tariffs and non-tariff barriers to LDC goods the richer countries should commit themselves to a programme of improving technical cooperation . 
but he also argued that the investment climate for the poorest states -- which traditionally have maintained tough controls over foreign firms -- would be improved by a global agreement on investment rules . 
this proposal , echoed in a report from the WTO Secretariat this week , has brought criticism from both LDCs and more advanced emerging economies who insist they must maintain their powers to steer FDI according to national development policies . 
many Asian and African developing countries argue that discussion of investment issues should be pursued in UNCTAD , and not in the WTO which sets binding rules for all its members .
