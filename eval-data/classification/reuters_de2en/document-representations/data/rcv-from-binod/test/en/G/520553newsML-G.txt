Israelis awaited a decision by state prosecutors expected on Sunday on whether to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a corruption scandal that could topple his government . 
Israel Radio said on Friday State Attorney Edna Arbel had already made up her mind but would not disclose her decision before Sunday . 
other Israeli media speculated top government officials would be indicted but Netanyahu would not be charged . 
&quot; We are finishing our work . 
we are trying to do our best to try to finish this Sunday , hopefully , and then everyone will know our decision , &quot; Arbel told reporters . 
police this week handed state prosecutors their 995-page report on the influence-peddling scandal along with a recommendation to indict Netanyahu and three associates . 
the 47-year-old leader , elected 11 months ago by less than a percentage point , has rejected calls he resign despite newspaper opinion polls showing a majority of Israelis believe he must step down if charged or convicted . 
but even if the prime minister is not indicted , a scathing report on the scandal by the state attorney could crumble Netanyahu &apos;s ruling coalition of mainly right-wing and religious parties . 
&quot; Even if no one is charged , should it become clear that very serious things were done from a public and democratic standpoint , we &apos;ll not be able to go on backing such a government and will want early elections , &quot; Yehuda Harel , of the four-member Third Way in Netanyahu &apos;s coalition , told army radio . 
other cabinet ministers , including Natan Sharansky of the seven-member Israel Be &apos;aliya party , have said during the course of the 12-week investigation that if the allegations prove true they will resign . 
&quot; We decided not to take any extraordinary measures ... as long as there is no decision by the state attorney &apos;s office . 
immediately afterwards , we will meet and make a decision , &quot; said Sharansky after a meeting of his parliamentary faction . 
prosecutors could still ignore the police recommendation that Netanyahu be charged over the appointment of Likud activist Roni Bar-On as attorney general three months ago . 
Israel &apos;s Channel One television got the police probe going by alleging in a report in January that a Netanyahu ally on trial for corruption , politician Aryeh Deri , pushed Bar-On for the job in hopes of winning a plea bargain . 
Netanyahu , who has called the allegations &quot; nonsense &quot; , is under no legal obligation to quit if indicted although High Court judges have ruled in the past that ministers under indictment must step down . 
&quot; According to today &apos;s likely trend , the decision at the state attorney &apos;s office is to issue an indictment against Aryeh Deri alone , &quot; said Channel One reporter Amnon Abramovich . 
a Gallup poll of 487 Jews for the daily Maariv on Friday showed 52.6 percent believed Netanyahu must quit and call elections if indicted . 
a Dahaf Institute poll of 503 adults in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth showed 52 percent wanted him to resign if convicted . 
the results were typically close , pollster Hanoch Smith told Reuters . 
&quot; Israeli society remains very evenly divided as it is on almost all basic political issues . 
the affair has overshadowed a two-day mission by U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross aimed at reviving Israel-PLO peace talks . 
Ross left the region on Friday with Palestinians declaring the month-old crisis in peace moves sparked by Israeli settlement construction in Arab East Jerusalem had not abated . 
&quot; We still have a major crisis , &quot; said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat .
