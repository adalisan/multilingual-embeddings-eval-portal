supporters of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto &apos;s estranged brother Murtaza , who was killed in a shootout with police , want his Arab-born widow to lead their movement to challenge the government . 
they said they would offer the leadership of Murtaza &apos;s breakaway Shaheed Bhutto faction of the ruling Pakistan People &apos;s Party ( PPP ) to his Lebanese wife Ghinwa . 
the decision was taken by a Central Coordination Committee meeting of the faction on Sunday in town of Larkana , two days after Murtaza and domr of his followers were killed in a gunfight with police in Karachi , capital of Sindh province . 
it was not immediately known whether the committee had consulted Ghinwa beforehand or whether she would be ready to accept the offer . 
she told reporters earlier that she would stay in Pakistan despite her husband &apos;s death but had not decided yet whether to enter politics , which has been full of controversy and tragedy for the Bhutto family . 
Benazir Bhutto took over the PPP leadership mantle from her father , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , who was ousted as prime minister in an army coup in 1977 and executed in 1979 after a controversial conviction for conspiring the murder of a political opponent . 
Murtaza challenged her leadership when he returned in 1993 after 16 years in self-imposed exile , mainly in Syria . 
he set up his rival group in March last year , but attracted no political heavyweights from his sister &apos;s mainstream party . 
but political sources said protest demonstrations in his home province of Sindh and some other parts of Pakistan after his death showed that Murtaza had built up a dedicated hard core of followers with considerable support . 
if she accepts their offer , Ghinwa , a former teacher who speaks English and French as well as her native Arabic , will become the first Arab woman to lead a Pakistani political group , although not the first foreign-born . 
her Iranian-born mother-in-law Nusrat remained figurhead PPP chief after Zulfikar Bhutto &apos;s execution before she was ousted by Benazir in 1993 and her Iranian origin was never questioned . 
Islam &apos;s Arab heroes and heroines are revered in Islamic Pakistan as much as in their native lands . 
the Larkana meeting of Murtaza &apos;s faction also decided to demand the appointment of a Supreme Court judge to investigate his death rather than the provincial high court judge already named by the Sindh province government . 
Murtaza &apos;s supporters , accusing Benazir &apos;s husband of conspiring in the killing of their leader , clashed with police in Larkana on Sunday and prevented President Farooq Leghari from paying a condolence call on the family . 
they also set fire to a police van and motorcyle and stoned private vehicles in Lahore , capital of the province of Punjab , witnesses there said . 
Murtaza , 42 , was shot and killed with six of his followers in a clash with police in Karachi on Friday night . 
another of his supporters died of his wounds on Saturday . 
surviving members of the powerful but divided Bhutto political dynasty came together at the family &apos;s ancestral home in Larkana to pay their last respects to Murtaza , who was estranged from his older sister for much of his turbulent life . 
Nusrat issued a statement , carried by the official news agency APP , saying that Murtaza &apos;s death was part of a conspiracy against the Bhutto family and denying reports that she had implicated Benazir and her husband . 
&quot; The vicious , malicious and the unkindest remarks attributed to me are only designed to create confusion in peoples &apos; minds with a view to diverting attention from the real culprits whom the independent commission will identify , &quot; she said .
