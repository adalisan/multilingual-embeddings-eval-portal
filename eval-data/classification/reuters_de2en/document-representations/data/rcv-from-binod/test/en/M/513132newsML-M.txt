Argentine traders said Wednesday they were unsure if a rumored big sale of soybean meal to China had taken place . 
replying to talk that China had taken up to 300,000 tonnes of South American soymeal , one trader said , &quot; It &apos;s all rumors , there &apos;s nothing confirmed . 
but he added that if a deal had taken place , it would probably have involved Argentine meal . 
he said he thought about $ 21 under Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) prices would be a logical price for 46 percent protein-fat meal . 
one trader said that high stocks in China meant that the Chinese would not be buying now . 
but others said the Chinese were in the market and hungry for meal . 
&quot; June or July would probably make sense more than May . 
because May is still a bit inverted to the deferred , &quot; another trader said , &quot; Also why would the Chinese pay inverse for the near buys when they have good stocks , which is true . 
he added , &quot; Maybe they liked the prices and so went out and got coverage for June-July , which would make perfect sense . 
he said that , if the Chinese had bought meal for June-July , it could be either Argentine or Brazilian , or optional origin . 
but another trader said that the Chinese purchase probably existed only in the minds of over-excited Chicago traders . 
&quot; At this moment the demand is just buying hand-to-mouth , &quot; he said , &quot; There &apos;s some near European buying . 
some &apos;s being shipped to Iran , but that was done two months ago . 
there is no fresh demand . 
he said $ 21 under CBOT sounded too cheap if any deal had been done .
