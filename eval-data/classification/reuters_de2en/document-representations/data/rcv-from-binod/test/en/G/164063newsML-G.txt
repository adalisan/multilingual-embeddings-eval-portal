Raymond Chretien , the new U.N. envoy for the eastern Zairean crisis , expects to see Zaire &apos;s ailing Mobutu Sese Seko in the French Riviera capital of Nice later this week , the United Nations said on Monday . 
Chretien , Canada &apos;s ambassador to Washington , is scheduled to leave for Nice on Tuesday , U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana FOA said , in an attempt to speak to him before going to Central Africa . 
Chretien is on a one-month mission to try to nail down a ceasefire in eastern Zaire as well as to plan for an international conference in the region . 
Mobutu had been in Switzerland since August when he underwent surgery for prostate cancer at the University Hospital in Lausanne , Swtizerland . 
French diplomatic sources said he would head home to his troubled country in a few days . 
at the United Nations , diplomats said Germany had requested a Security Council meeting as soon as possible on the humanitarian crisis where hundreds of thousands of refugees are fleeing the fighting between local Tutsi and have been left without provisions . 
envoys said they expected informal council consultations on Zaire on Tuesday but were not sure yet when an open meeting would follow . 
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel , in a statement released in Bonn , said the main aim of the international community should be to work toward an immediate ceasefire and for airports at Bukavu and Goma , now in the hands of Tutsi rebels , to be opened for aid flights . 
but there are still differences on how to handle any action , whether the refugees should be encouraged to return to Rwanda as Sadako Ogata , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees , has advocated or whether the camps should be reconstituted in Zaire as France appears to want . 
&quot; The political context for humanitarian aid is not clear , &quot; said one council diplomat , who said some members preferred to see what action was advocated by African states meeting in Nairobi on Tuesday . 
Germany has been frustrated for the past week at council discussions which resulted in public statements , calling for a ceasefire and an eventual international conference in Central Africa , depending on findings by Chretien . 
its ambassador , tono Eitel , last week told council members that the world community should instead be discussing immediate action to stem the humanitarian crisis .
