Federal Reserve policy-makers meet on Tuesday to consider raising interest rates for the second time in three months in what would be a politically controversial move to stay a step ahead of inflation . 
wall Street analysts are virtually split down the middle over whether or not the central bank will act to push up short-term rates by another quarter percentage point . 
&quot; The market is pretty confused at this point , &quot; said Dave Connors , manager of government bond trading at Credit Suisse First Boston . 
&quot; If you ask most people their opinion , the honest answer is , &apos; I don &apos;t know . 
a rate increase would mean higher borrowing costs for everyone from consumers using credit cars to the stores where they shop . 
it would also likely disrupt financial markets . 
arguing for another rate rise : an economy that has been growing too quickly for its own good , a tight jobs market ( the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in over 23 years ) , rising wages and a stock market that may be too exuberant . 
arguing against : an expected slowdown in the economy , scant sign of any pick-up in inflation , increased worker productivity and spare capacity in the industrial sector . 
&quot; It &apos;s a tough call , &quot; said one Fed official , who declined to be identified . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to have a great deal of conviction . 
at its last meeting on March 25 , the central bank &apos;s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee raised short-term rates for the first time in more than two years , bumping them up by a quarter percentage point . 
the federal funds rate -- the rate commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans -- now stands at 5.5 percent . 
the discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges the banks for money -- is 5.00 ( corrects from 5.25 ) percent . 
an unusual alliance of corporations and labour unions , conservatives and liberals is already lining up to attack the Fed if it decides to tighten credit further . 
&quot; If the Fed raises rates again , just to make sure workers don &apos;t finally get to benefit from this long recovery , we will surely see protests all over the country , &quot; said Roger Hickey , co-director of the liberal Campaign for America &apos;s Future . 
in a speech in New York earlier this month , Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan vociferously defended the March rate increase , calling it a prudent step to guard against inflation and likening it to a vaccination to prevent a serious disease . 
but he steered clear of spelling out what he intends to do on Tuesday , although he did say the Fed would need to raise rates again if economic growth fails to slow down as expected . 
growth does seem to be moderating from its rapid rate of the first quarter , when the economy expanded at its fastest clip in more than nine years . 
sales at retail stores dropped in April and industrial production was flat . 
but it is not clear how long the slowdown will last , analysts say . 
jobs are plentiful and consumers are confident , pointing to the likelihood of a pick-up later this year . 
the recent fall of the dollar and the rise of the stock and bond markets should also help underpin growth , analysts said . 
the dollar &apos;s drop make U.S. goods more competitive on world markets , boosting exports . 
the rise of the bond market means lower long-term interest rates , encouraging home buyers , and the buoyant stock market makes investors feel richer . 
Joel Prakken , Chairman of St. Louis-based macroeconomic Advisers , said he expects the Fed to raise rates on Tuesday . 
even though growth looks set to slow , the economy may have already overshot its potential , raising the risk of inflation , he said . 
former Fed governor Lyle Gramley agreed that the central bank will eventually need to increase rates further to make sure that inflation does not pick up . 
but he saw no urgency in acting now and does not expect a move on Tuesday . 
&quot; The chances are less than 50-50 they will ( act ) , &quot; said Gramley , now a consultant at the Mortgage Bankers Association . 
but he added that it was a tough call .
