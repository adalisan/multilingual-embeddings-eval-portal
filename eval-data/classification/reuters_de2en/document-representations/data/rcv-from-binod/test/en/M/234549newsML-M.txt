Dutch bonds ended lower and near the day &apos;s lows as slightly negative economic data and shortening trades combined to undermine longer guilder paper . 
&quot; It wasn &apos;t too steady , to be honest . 
there were quite a few sellers in the long end , just like yesterday . 
it seems that paper hasn &apos;t been absorbed yet , &quot; said one trader . 
but he noted demand to buy 2000 and 2001 paper . 
the market had opened weaker after news of stronger than expected third quarter German economic growth . 
&quot; afterwards , we started some irrational trading without any real direction , &quot; he added . 
he said volumes were high as a number of domestic institutions switched into mid-curve paper and out of 2005 and 2006 bonds , continuing a pattern seen on Tuesday . 
&quot; People are taking profits and benefitting from the flattening of the curve , &quot; said another trader , referring to the 100 basis point drop in 10-year Dutch yields since June . 
two-year yields have fallen 82 basis points in the same period but , he said , some people were betting on outperformance by shorter maturities on hopes of a lower German repo rate . 
&quot; That means the curve will steepen again . 
people are positioning themselves , &quot; he said . 
the spread between 10 year and five year yields narrowed to 94 basis points froom 97 a day earlier , while the gap between 10 and two year paper dropped to 213 basis points from 215 . 
another dealer said news today of a rise in German industry orders in October after a fall in September also contributed to the weakness in the Dutch market . 
he said people concerned that the German economy was not growing strongly enough after seeing industrial production data on Tuesday would have been allayed by the October orders . 
&quot; Now they &apos;re worrying about ( higher ) yields , &quot; he said .
