Dutch shares closed at a record high on Wednesday with powerful performances from KPN and Philips lifting a basically mixed market to new peaks . 
the AEX finished 5.13 points higher at 817.12 , a level which beat the previous closing high of 812.19 set on May 26 . 
the day &apos;s 818.23 high was a new all-time peak , passing the previous 815.18 trading high set on Tuesday . 
&quot; The market is actually a little bit tired . 
if it wasn &apos;t for the big gains in KPN and Philips the market would be mixed , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; Unilever fell , Royal Dutch and the financials didn &apos;t do much , it wasn &apos;t that broadly based today , &quot; he said . 
dealers said the market could be ripe for a little profit-taking after today &apos;s gains , especially after a fall in bonds and a weaker early showing on Wall Street . 
&quot; It looks like people have been searching for shares that have been left behind a little , KPN has been seen as that kind of stock , &quot; said the dealer . 
KPN finished 3.90 guilders or 5.52 percent higher at 74.60 , boosted by renewed speculation that the company was about to list its telecoms and postal arms separately , following a Dutch finance ministry ruling on Tuesday that would remove tax obstacles for companies seeking to demerge . 
KPN said on Wednesday it had still yet to announce a decision about splitting its listings , a move the company has been mulling for some time . 
it has said it plans to make a decision before the end of the year . 
dealers said the shares were further boosted by news the partners in Unisource , which includes KPN &apos;s telecom arm , were planning to merge their international networks in a move which could deliver cost savings of 20-30 percent . 
&quot; It was a bit of a surprise that it &apos;s going to save so many costs , &quot; said Delta Lloyd Bank analyst Peter Wortel . 
&quot; That would be great news ( for Unisource ) in the short term , &quot; he said . 
Philips closed 4.20 guilders higher at 117.90 , boosted by reports Morgan Stanley had raised its 12 month share price target to 150 guilders from 125 guilders . 
&quot; That looks incredibly high to me , but it was enough to get people buying the stock , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; To many Dutch people the existing level for Philips looks high , &quot; he added . 
elsewhere prices were mixed with Unilever down 2.80 guilders to 375.20 , Royal Dutch up 10 cents to 377.60 guilders and ABN AMRO off 40 cents to 35.90 guilders .
