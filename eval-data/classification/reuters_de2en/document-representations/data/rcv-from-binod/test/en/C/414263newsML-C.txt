Avenor Inc. on Monday lowered its all-stock offer for financially troubled Repap Enterprises Inc. to C $ 2.75 billion ( $ 2 billion ) after Avenor shareholders complained the original C $ 3.4 billion ( $ 2.5 billion ) bid was too high . 
the two Montreal-based pulp and paper companies said their boards agreed to the amended offer , under which Avenor is offering one newly issued share of Avenor for every eight shares of Repap . 
Avenor &apos;s original bid , made Dec . 18 , offered one Avenor share for every 4.25 shares of Repap . 
in the original offer , Avenor also planned to assume Repap &apos;s C $ 2.4 billion ( $ 1.78 billion ) of debt . 
under the revised offer , Avenor would assume only C $ 2.26 billion ( $ 1.67 billion ) of Repap debt , and the value of the all-stock offer to Repap shareholders would be reduced by 46 percent to C $ 396 million ( 293 million ) from C $ 701 million ( $ 519 million ) . 
Repap shareholders would own about 15.5 percent of the merged company instead of the 23.5 percent originally planned . 
another key to the restructured deal is the exclusion of Repap &apos;s money-losing pulp operations in the west coast province of British Columbia . 
Repap B.C. , which has total liabilities of C $ 620 million ( $ 459 million ) , was effectively handed over to its bank creditors on Monday , Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank . 
the new Avenor will honor about C $ 72 million ( $ 53 million ) owed the banks by Repap B.C. 
under the revised offer , Avenor also will not proceed with the originally planned private placements of C $ 75 million ( $ 55.5 million ) of common shares and C $ 140 million ( $ 104 million ) of convertible debentures . 
Repap Chief Executive George petty told a news conference that the revised offer was necessary after the stock market &apos;s &quot; brutal &quot; reaction to the original merger bid . 
Repap &apos;s stock slipped to below C $ 2 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the weeks after the December offer from about C $ 5 at the time of the bid , indicating that Avenor investors thought the offer was too rich . 
the merger bid must be approved by at least two-thirds of Avenor shareholders . 
after the revised offer was announced on Monday , Repap shares rose C22 cents to C $ 2.64 in Toronto and increased by 12.5 cents to $ 1.90 on Nasdaq . 
Avenor Chief Executive Paul gagne said he was &quot; very confident &quot; Avenor shareholders would approve the revised offer because it created a new Avenor that would have less debt , better assets and undergo less share dilution than the original offer . 
analysts said they generally approved of the revised offer . 
&quot; This is a terrific change , &quot; said William Wigder , of CS First Boston , during a telephone conference call with Avenor . 
gagne said Avenor said planned to proceed with the divestiture of both its own operations in British Columbia , which included 53 percent of Pacific Forest Products Ltd . , and the wholly owned Gold River pulp mill , and the sale of Repap &apos;s pulp mill in Manitoba . 
the divestitures were expected to yield gross proceeds of C $ 500 million ( $ 370 million ) , he said . 
Avenor shareholders will vote on the new offer on March 26 .
