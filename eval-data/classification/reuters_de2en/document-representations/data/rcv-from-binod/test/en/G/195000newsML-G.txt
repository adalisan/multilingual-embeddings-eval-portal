Jemima Khan , wife of former Pakistan test cricketeer turned politician Imran Khan , gave birth to a baby boy on Sunday , a hospital spokeswoman said . 
the seven pound , 14 ounce ( three kg ) boy is the first child for the couple , who married in June 1995 . 
&quot; It &apos;s delivered . 
it weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces -- all was normal , &quot; said a spokeswoman for the Portland Hospital in London , which has a maternity clinic that often caters to the rich and famous . 
&quot; Mother &apos;s very well , &quot; she added . 
Jemima , 22-year-old daughter of wealthy Jewish industrialist Sir James Goldsmith , surprised both Britons and Pakistanis when she wed Khan , 42 . 
but she said she would fit into his culture , converted to Islam , and moved to Pakistan . 
Khan , who has announced his intentions to launch a political career in his native Pakistan , had acquired a reputation as a playboy during his long international cricket career . 
Khan and Jemima &apos;s mother Lady Annabel Goldsmith were both present at birth , the spokeswoman said . 
the baby &apos;s name has not been announced .
