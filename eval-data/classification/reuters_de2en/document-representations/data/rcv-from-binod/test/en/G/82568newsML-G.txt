the Australian government was working on making travel to Australia easier for Hong Kong passport holders , Hong Kong Chief Secretary Anson Chan said on Friday . 
&quot; I believe that the government has under consideration certain arrangements that will make the visa application and obtaining the necessary visa even easier , &quot; Chan told reporters after meeting with Australia &apos;s Prime Minister John Howard . 
Chan said she had discussed with Howard the issue of visa-free access for Hong Kong passport holders after China resumes control of the British colony in July 1997 . 
she noted about 80,000 people from Hong Kong were now residents in Australia and 12,000 students were studying here . 
&quot; Given our increasingly strong ties it is in both our interest that travel between Australia and Hong Kong should be made flexible and easy , &quot; she added .
