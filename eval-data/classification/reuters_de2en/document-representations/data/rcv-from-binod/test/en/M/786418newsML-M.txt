potential exists for zinc prices to climb higher following a shakeout that saw holders of long positions exit the market , Australian dealers said on Thursday . 
concern that prices had outstripped industry fundamentals when prices rocketed to around US $ 1,700 a tonne last month have receded as zinc hovers around US $ 1,512 a tonne , they said . 
&quot; The price got ahead of the market when the price got to US $ 1,600- $ 1,675 ( a tonne ) but that &apos;s now corrected , &quot; one metals dealer said . 
&quot; We got a lot of long stales out at that point and now we &apos;re in a period of consolidation . 
such a &quot; price limbo &quot; should give the market &quot; a chance to catch its breath &quot; before moving up again , another dealer said . 
expectations that industry inventories will continue to slip and the lack of room for a lift to world smelting capacity , further support a brighter outlook for zinc , they said . 
supplies of zinc remain pinched despite record Chinese production and exports , indicating consumption is exceeding output , another dealer said . 
&quot; This is likely to continue for the next couple of years until new capacity is introduced , &quot; he said . 
he added that there were strong signs that little spare zinc was available for the spot market . 
&quot; When the market goes into a backwardation , all the physical trades look to sell the stocks they are holding so they are not exposed to the backwardation , &quot; another dealer said . 
the key London Metal Exchange cash to three-month backwardation currently sits at about US $ 100 . 
few in the industry are believed to hold inventories and a hand-to-mouth supply situation continues among most consumers . 
&quot; When the price did fall , and in light of the backwardation , there were a lot of consumers looking to buy zinc for deliver in 1998 and 1999 at lower cash prices , &quot; said a buyer for an Asian smelter . 
in effect , consumers are able to take advantage of the backwardation by purchasing cheaper metal forward . 
but the situation also offers the possibility for bigger profits if the price does surge . 
news that China &apos;s Zhuzhou zinc smelter is delaying exports to Taiwan to try to meet LME September delivery obligations on short positions is expected to do little to alter market conditions . 
one LME dealer labeled the effort by Zhuzhou as &quot; desperate , &quot; while another called it &quot; insignifcant . 
&quot; It &apos;s only marginal tonnage and it &apos;s insignificant in comparison to their reported short positions , &quot; a dealer said . 
in a disastrous move , the Chinese this year sold hundreds of thousands of tonnes of zinc it did not have at bargain prices during a bull market . 
the contracts are now coming due for delivery . 
higher zinc prices are likely to encourage more mine development and bring back on stream more mines where output has been idled or curtailed . 
anvil Range Mining Corp &apos;s 180,000-tonnes-a-year Faro mine in the Yukon Territory , shut by a depressed market last December , has been mentioned as one that could restart . 
however , lacking new smelting capacity , charges paid by miners to smelt zinc would probably rise in the event mine production is stepped up , dealers said .
