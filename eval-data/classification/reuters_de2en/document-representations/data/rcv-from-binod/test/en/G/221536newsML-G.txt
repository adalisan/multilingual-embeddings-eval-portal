some MPs in the caretaker conservative National government want nationalist New Zealand First to declare it the preferred coalition partner before signing a coalition deal , the Evening Post newspaper reported on Wednesday . 
NZ First holds the balance of power after the October 12 election and is negotiating separately with both National and the centre-left Labour Party over the shape of the next government . 
NZ First leader Winston Peters has in the past said his party wanted detailed written agreements with both National and Labour before making its choice . 
but National MPs are unlikely to agree to that approach because they believe any policy compromises they agree to could be thrown back in their faces if NZ First chooses Labour , the newspaper reported . 
prominent National backbencher Max Bradford , who is in National &apos;s negotiating team , said : &quot; I don &apos;t think the negotiators are that stupid , &quot; when asked if National was prepared to sign a coalition deal and then wait for NZ First to choose . 
the paper said backbench National MPs had discussed their concerns last night and Prime Minister Jim Bolger was due to brief the caucus on Wednesday on the party &apos;s approach . 
NZ First leader Winston Peters said he would not use a failed coalition deal to embarrass another party . 
&quot; We are not interested in throwing things in people &apos;s faces . 
that is not helpful now or in the future , &quot; Peters told the newspaper . 
after a round of talks with National today Peters said no- one had expressed discomfort about the process of reaching an agreement .
