volume was high at 604.6 million reais ( $ 588.2 million ) . 
the publication in Brazil &apos;s Official Gazette was seen as the government &apos;s first step towards the widely-expected privatization of the country &apos;s telecommunications sector . 
the rules state that concessions to run the so-called band B cellular services will be valid for 15 years and are renewable after that period . 
private consortia will be invited to bid to operate 10 regional concessions . 
any one group will be limited to a maximum of one concession in Brazil &apos;s developed south and southeast and another in the underdeveloped north . 
progress in the privatization front led Telebras to rise sharply earlier , but speculation the company would later today announce weaker-than-expected nine-month earnings contributed to cut the stock &apos;s gains . 
Telebras preferred ended at 80.40 reais , up 1.77 percent . 
shares of other telecom companies , however , performed better . 
percent , closing at 196 reais , while Rio de Janeiro-based Telerj surged 7.31 percent to 110 reais . 
although trade in Rio de Janeiro state bank Banerj resumed on Tuesday , analysts noted there was no dealing in the stock . 
trade in Banerj had been suspended since October 9 following a request by Brazil &apos;s Securities and Exchange Commission ( CVM ) for information on the rights of the banks &apos;s minority holders in light of its privatization . 
Banerj is due to be sold off later this year . 
brokers also said the market could continue firming on Wednesday , but they did not rule out the possibility that investors would decide to take profits , particularly on the telecomunications stocks .
