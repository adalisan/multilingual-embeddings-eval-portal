German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said on Saturday he hoped European leaders could still reach agreement next week on a fiscal stability pact to ensure discipline after the start of European monetary union . 
Waigel told a meeting of the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , sister party to Chancellor Helmut Kohl &apos;s Christian Democrats ( CDU ) , that Germany and France were not at odds over the need for the stability pact after Friday &apos;s Franco-German summit . 
&quot; I hope we can still reach an agreement , &quot; said Waigel , who will meet with EU finance ministers on Sunday night in Amsterdam ahead of Monday &apos;s EU summit where the pact will be a top issue . 
Waigel said weekend talks among European officials would centre on France &apos;s demand for greater emphasis on job creation , an issue he said Germany was not completely against . 
France &apos;s new Socialist prime minister , Lionel Jospin , said on Friday after the summit that Paris was committed to a single currency but that growth and jobs must be given the same importance as the stability pact limiting budget deficits . 
&quot; The issue of the stability pact has not been put into question by the new French government , &quot; Waigel said . 
&quot; Not a single comma , not a single period and not a single word will be changed . 
everyone must know that . 
&quot; The question is whether we can reach agreement over the issue of employment and whether we can say more , &quot; Waigel said . 
France is expected to receive concessions on job issues through two political declarations that will accompany the EMU stability pact . 
the declarations will call for stronger links between job creation and the new euro , set to start in 1999 . 
Waigel , architect of the stability pact approved last year in Dublin and due for approval at the Amsterdam summit , said Bonn was committed to fighting unemployment levels that reached post-war records earlier in the year . 
but he said Germany remained committed to the need for the stability pact to ensure credibility for the new currency , a requirement to win the support of the German public . 
&quot; We must take them seriously , &quot; Waigel said of opinion polls showing opposition among a majority of the the German public to exchanging the mark for a weaker currency . 
&quot; The mark is more than just a currency , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It is part of the identity of Germany , one struck even before we won our first Olympic gold medal or first world soccer championship . 
there is only one answer to win support - stability , stability and once more stability . 
Waigel reaffirmed his insistence that nations seeking to join currency union at the start in January 1999 must have a deficit level of 3.0 percent or less of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , a level many economists say Germany itself cannot reach . 
many leading German officials have said Waigel must back off his insistence on the 3.0 percent level in order to save currency union from being delayed or abandoned all together . 
but some top CSU officials have said fulfilling the entry criteria laid out in the Maastricht Treaty are more important than following the timeline to start EMU on time . 
&quot; Discussions over whether the criteria should be 3.2 percent or 3.3 percent are not necessary . 
if we allow that , then other countries will say 3.7 percent or 4.1 percent is OK and then we reach a point where the German public will no longer believe in the new currency , &quot; Waigel said . 
&quot; That &apos;s why we fight so hard for a credible and stable currency , &quot; he said . 
Waigel said the German economic climate had improved in recent months and predicted 1997 economic growth of about 2.5 percent and growth of 2.75 percent for next year . 
&quot; The economic climate has brightened , &quot; he said , noting lower interest rates , stable currency market rates and higher incoming orders among many German companies . 
&quot; Everything points to better growth , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We have a strong chance of turning the corner on fighting unemployment . 
and we must have tax reform to help fight unemployment .
