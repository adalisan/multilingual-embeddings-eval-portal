Polish shares rebounded on Tuesday after Monday &apos;s dip and analysts said more growth seemed likely on Wednesday after the session &apos;s stronger buying after price fixing and rises by some stocks in continuous trade . 
they said there was a chance the market could form a growth trend after the recent stabilisation in which small-cap firms outperformed blue chips , making Warsaw stocks relatively cheap . 
&quot; For the time being small-cap firms are rising but it can &apos;t be ruled out that soon large-caps will move -- the attractiveness of our bourse is growing due to rises on other markets , &quot; said Cezary Markiewicz of Bank Gdanski brokerage . 
Markiewicz said future earnings by Polish firms would likely shrink the current bourse p / e ratio of around 16.5 . 
the main market &apos;s all-share WIG index rose 0.7 percent to 17,719.0 points and turnover rose 8.8 percent to 196.1 million zlotys ( $ 63.5 million ) on all three markets . 
gainers led losers by 61 to 15 with 14 stocks flat . 
analysts said Monday &apos;s news food prices were flat in February &apos;s last third and rose 0.1 percent from January &apos;s last third could help the market though no rate cut was imminent . 
they said top gainer Optimus , which surged 10 percent , may have gained on rumours the computer firm would announce closer cooperation with Microsoft than Tuesday &apos;s launching of a new computer under a joint brand . 
they said Monday &apos;s news the overall business climate worsened in February was offset by the news that the climate in the construction and trading sectors improved . 
NFI units rose two percent at the regular session and fell 0.9 percent in continuous trade , where the WIG 20 index gained 1.3 percent .
