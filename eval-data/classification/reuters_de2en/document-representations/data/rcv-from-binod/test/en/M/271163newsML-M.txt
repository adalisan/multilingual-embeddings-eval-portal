Hong Kong gold ended unchanged on Friday from New York &apos;s Thursday close , with trade marked only by light Japanese sales in pre-opening business , dealers said . 
&quot; The market was quiet but interesting , &quot; said one senior dealer . 
he noted that no selling pressure had emerged despite gold trading near the top end of the range . 
&quot; The range has been seen at between $ 368 and $ 370 , and for the past few days we &apos;ve been trading near the top end and haven &apos;t seen any selling pressure , &quot; the senior dealer said . 
this meant market expectations of sales appeared unfounded , he added . 
other traders reported some physical sales . 
the carryover charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society rose to -2.00 from its previous fix at -4.00 .
