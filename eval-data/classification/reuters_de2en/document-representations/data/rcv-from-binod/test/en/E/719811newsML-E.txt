the Bank of Spain is likely to pursue a cautious policy on interest rates until Spain &apos;s berth in the launch of Europe &apos;s single currency is confirmed , Argentaria said in its monthly economic report . 
&quot; There is still significant margin to adjust interest rates . 
nonetheless , in our opinion , the main part of this scope will be used once Spain has been confirmed as a member of the group of countries launching the euro , &quot; the report said . 
until then , the Bank of Spain will pursue a &quot; cautious line &quot; that would be conditioned by the strength of the economic recovery , the need to preserve control of prices and confidence in the peseta . 
but this caution would be compatible with another reduction in interest rates this year provided inflation is moderate , there is progress on the budget , budget plans are solid and markets are tranquil , it said .
