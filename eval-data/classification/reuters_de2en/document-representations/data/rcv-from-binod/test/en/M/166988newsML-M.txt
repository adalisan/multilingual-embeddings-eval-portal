Dutch shares ended strongly on Tuesday after a day spent drifting when the focus was on results from flag carrier KLM but then received a boost in late trading from a firm start to U.S. stocks . 
markets across Europe made a subdued start this morning as investors remained cautious ahead of the U.S. election results and Russian President Yelsin &apos;s heart operation . 
but signs that the operation had been successful and the feeling that Democrats would not win control of Congress began to gain ground , giving Wall Street a flying start . 
dealers said KLM &apos;s results were not as bad as some had feared , which prompted some initial buying and pushed the stock to a high of 44.80 guilders . 
it then slipped back a little , ending 1.90 up at 43.80 guilders . 
KLM announced first half operating profits down to 262 million guilders from 497 million , eroded by increased fuel costs , a higher wage bill and sub-contractor costs . 
but net profit rose to 529 million guilders from 437 million , swollen by profits on the sale and revaluation of its preferred shareholding in U.S. partner Northwest Airlines . 
analysts described the results were slightly disappointing but pinned their hopes on the three year restructuring plan . 
&quot; The restructuring programme is badly needed to compensate tariff pressure from market liberalisation in Europe , &quot; said Thibaud de Guerre , airlines analyst with ING Barings . 
elsewhere , retailer Ahold had another strong day after its announcement on Monday of a move into the Brazilian supermarket chain of Bompreco . 
Ahold said it was taking a 50 percent stake in the food retailer , the fourth largest in Brazil . 
Ahold shares closed up 2.30 guilders at 103.50 , on top of a 1.40 guilder rise late on Monday . 
analysts said the move was surprising and daring , and most maintained their buy recommendations on the stock . 
&quot; This announcement by Ahold marks yet another step towards realising its ambition of becoming the world &apos;s largest food retailer , &quot; ING Barings Research said . 
&quot; As we feel the current valuation of Ahold still does not take into account its strong global prospects , we reiterate our Buy recommendation . 
most other stocks ended in the plus column but Philips , one of the other most active issues , slipped 0.30 to 60.00 guilders .
