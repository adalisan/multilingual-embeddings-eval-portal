upcoming coffee crops looked comfortable enough to keep global markets well supplied while allowing for consumption rises , said the head of raw materials purchasing at German roaster J.J. Darboven , Guenther Fude . 
Fude in an interview with Reuters said arabica prices may range between 100 and 130 cents per lb in the foreseeable future , which both consumers and producers could live with . 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said last Friday global output in 1996 / 97 should be up 12 percent from last season at 100.9 million 60-kilogram bags . 
Fude said European roasters would be able to continue with a hand-to-mouth strategy brought by a tight 95 / 96 season . 
key producer Colombia was likely to try and regain lost market share in Germany , one of its most important clients . 
Fude put Colombia &apos;s potential exports at 11 to 12 million bags from stocks built over the last two years and the new crop , which the USDA pegged at 12.5 million ( 12.9 in 95 / 96 ) . 
its market share in Germany had fallen to 25 percent this year from 40 percent last year , due to a restrictive export policies and internal infrastructure problems , Fude said . 
but he believed Colombia was interested in gaining , and keeping , one third of the German washed arabica market . 
J.J. Darboven chairman Albert Darboven said the premium coffee company with a seven percent market share maintained its use of Colombians at 35-45 percent in its blends this year while other roasters stepped up the use of substitutes . 
Fude said African and Central American arabicas were used as replacements along with Brazilian ( unwashed ) arabicas and robustas from a wide variety of origins . 
another result of Colombian export reductions was the development of highly varied physical coffee differentials . 
stable green coffee prices next year would help German roasters -- in the second largest market in the world after the U.S. -- to try to boost consumption after three years of falls . 
Green coffee use is seen staying at 564,000 tonnes in 1996 . 
volatility could cause irritation among coffee-drinkers and would undermine roasters &apos; efforts to achieve reasonable returns in a competitive market prone to losses and company failures . 
Fude , who acts as president of the European Coffee Federation ( ECF ) , said German retail prices , at 7.00 marks per 0.5 kg , were undervalued , given a 2.15 marks tax inclusion . 
Roasters in other European countries were more profitable .
