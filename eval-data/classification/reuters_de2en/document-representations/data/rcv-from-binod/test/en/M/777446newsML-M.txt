limited competition from West African crudes should boost demand for Asia &apos;s light crude grades and prop up prices this week , traders said on Monday . 
trading for the Asian light grades have moved to September and a relatively wide spread between Brent and Dubai , which is more than $ 1.00 per barrel during August , led Asian refiners to buy less West African crudes , traders said . 
instead , refiners in Australia , China and South Korea are buying Asian light crudes for September requirements , they said . 
West African cargoes take around one month to reach Asia and buyers usually start seeking cargoes for arrival in September in August . 
traders said when the spread is less than $ 1.00 , it becomes theoretically economical to ship in West African crudes to Asia . 
but there is still a lack of Japanese buying for heavier crudes such as Indonesia &apos;s Widuri and Minas , which could pull down prices for these grades even lower , traders said . 
the healthy demand from Japan a few weeks ago started to dry up last week as the summer turned cooler , forcing down heavy crude values . 
as Japan turns more towards the lighter , middle distillate-rich crudes to meet its heating oil stock requirements for the coming winter , the heavier grades are likely to remain under pressure . 
the Middle East crudes are expected to remain steady , since the bulk of September cargoes have been committed . 
the uncertainty of Iraqi crude exports had prompted Asian refiners to actively look for other Middle East grades from Oman and Abu Dhabi . 
India &apos;s purchase of seven Dubai cargoes in its September crude tender --five more than most traders &apos; expectations--had also supported the market , as other refiners were forced to look at alternative grades . 
this pushed up the September price of Oman crude to a premium over the official price , the first time this has happened in two months . 
only a few cargoes of Oman are unsold for September . 
a further support for Oman crude is seen in a reduction of the July official price to $ 17.46 per barrel , narrowing its premium to Dubai to 11 cents per barrel , from 47 cents in June . 
the narrower premium makes the Oman prices relatively cheaper compared to the previous month . 
a reduction in the Abu Dhabi and Qatar official prices are also expected , traders said . 
Murban and Lower Zakum crudes from Abu Dhabi , as well as Qatari grades were traded at premiums of three to five cents per barrel over their respective official prices , compared to discounts of between 25 and 20 cents in August .
