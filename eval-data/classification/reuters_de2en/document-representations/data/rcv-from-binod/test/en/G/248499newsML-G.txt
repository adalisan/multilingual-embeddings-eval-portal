triple champions Iran swamped Gulf rivals Saudi Arabia 3-0 ( 2-0 halftime ) in an Asian Cup group B match on Wednesday to join them in the quarter-finals . 
Saudi Arabia , one of the favourites to win the 12-nation tournament , made sure of a quarter-final berth on Sunday when they defeated Iraq 1-0 . 
Iraq needed to beat Thailand in the group &apos;s last match later on Wednesday to clinch a place in the last eight . 
Saudi Arabia and Iran have six points from three games with identical goal differences . 
backed by some 5,000 supporters waving Iranian flags and chanting Islam &apos;s rallying cry of &quot; Allahu Akbar &quot; ( God is greatest ) , Iran started strongly and defender Karim Bagheri put them ahead in the 12th minute . 
an Iranian corner played into the goalmouth was only partly cleared by the Saudi defence , allowing Bagheri to control the ball on the penalty spot and drive the ball past goalkeeper Mohammed al-Daeyea . 
Iran increased their lead in the 37th minute when Khodadad Azizi fed the ball to Ali Daei . 
he scored his third goal of the competition when his shot bounced off the left post into the net . 
the Saudis made two substitutions at halftime but found themselves in deeper trouble shortly after the restart when Azizi dribbled past three defenders inside the penalty area to score Iran &apos;s third .
