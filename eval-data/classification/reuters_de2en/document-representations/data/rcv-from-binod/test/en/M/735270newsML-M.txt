lower UK meals and feeds prices on Thursday , following the easier close in Chicago , failed to tempt buyers off the sidelines . 
high protein soymeal was as much as four stg down from the mill and stores but buyers would not move . 
&quot; Our biggest achievement today has been to finish the crossword &quot; said one broker . 
Rapemeal offers were one to two stg down while sunflower meals and corn gluten feed pellets were unchanged .
