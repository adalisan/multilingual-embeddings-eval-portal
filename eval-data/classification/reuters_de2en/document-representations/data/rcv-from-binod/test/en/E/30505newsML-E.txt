the Republic of Finland will be a slightly more frequent guest tapping international capital markets in 1997 than in the past two years , Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto said on Tuesday . 
&quot; We will be appearing a bit more frequently than in the past two years , &quot; Niinisto told Reuters in a telephone interview . 
&quot; But it will not be a question of any &apos; super-grand &apos; tranche , &quot; he said . 
the government had not yet decided on any target for how much of 1997 state borrowing should be raised at home in markka and how much abroad in foreign currencies , he added . 
of Finnish state January-July gross borrowing , 11.0 billion markka , or 11 percent , were in foreign currencies . 
but in net terms , foreign currency borrowing was zero , according to state treasury statistics . 
in 1995 , foreign currency borrowing in net terms was also zero . 
in gross terms , Finland borrowed 8.7 billion markka or 4.2 percent of the 206 billion markka total in foreign currencies , the state treasury said . 
next year , gross borrowing is projected at some 198 billion markka with the net borrowing requirement forecast at 28.8 billion markka . 
by end-July , the state has borrowed 34.4 billion markka or some 77 percent of this year &apos;s net total of 44.7 billion markka .
