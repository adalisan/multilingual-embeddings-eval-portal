Irish Prime Minister John Bruton made a fervent call for peace in Northern Ireland on Wednesday , telling the U.S. Congress that the Irish Republican Army must halt its violence &quot; in all circumstances . 
in a speech frequently interrupted by applause as he spoke of his hopes for a resolution of the Northern Ireland conflict , Bruton said a political agreement was within reach . 
addressing U.S. senators and congressmen assembled in the House of Representatives , he said Irish and Americans had welcomed efforts that had led to the 17-month IRA ceasefire that ended last February . 
&quot; But now all of us want the IRA to stop for good , &quot; Bruton said . 
&quot; True negotiations can only take place in an atmosphere of genuine peace . 
he said everyone had to be at all-party talks ready to negotiate . 
&quot; That can only happen , when everyone has been convinced that violence will never be used again to intimidate opponents or to control supporters , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Never again . 
&quot; That means a cessation of violence by the IRA that will hold in all circumstances , &quot; Bruton said amid applause . 
Sinn Fein , the political wing of the IRA , has been barred from the talks because of the guerrillas &apos; failure to reinstate their ceasefire . 
at another point in his speech , dealing with the need for &quot; global rules against terrorism , &quot; Bruton said those who wanted to win respect through democratic processes had to &quot; give up all connections with terror , give up the threat of terror and give up even coded and well-informed warnings about the possibility of terror . 
Bruton , who had talks with President Bill Clinton on Monday , was greeted in the ornate House chamber by some senior lawmakers of Irish heritage including Senators Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Patrick Leahy of Vermont . 
he said harmony in Northern Ireland would come in stages with the parties working together to solve practical , immediate problems . 
Dublin believed that this required talks moving swiftly beyond procedure to substantive issues of disagreement , he said , noting that some six weeks of talks under the chairmanship of former U.S. 
Senator George Mitchell had laid the foundation for movement . 
Bruton said Dublin was not asking the Unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland to end their loyalty to Britain or the Nationalists to cease being loyally Irish . 
but he said he was asking both to agree on a political framework to allow them to take on responsibility for solving day-to-day problems in harmony and cooperation with Britain and the rest of Ireland . 
Bruton said the people of Northern Ireland had cooperated on projects aided by the International Fund for Ireland and had agreed at the local level on how to deal with some contentious marches , but a wider agreement was needed now . 
warning against the &quot; destructive force of sectarianism , &quot; he said an agreement was needed within a workable time frame . 
&quot; Such an agreement it within reach , &quot; he said . 
both parties could change or redraft a framework agreed on last year by Britain and Ireland , he said . 
but Bruton said he was &quot; absolutely determined &quot; that the present generation of political leaders would tackle and overcome the core problems identified by the two governments . 
Bruton , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , acknowledged that Northern Ireland was divided by psychological boundaries but said similar boundaries in Europe had not prevented development of political structures in which minorities and majorities worked in partnership .
