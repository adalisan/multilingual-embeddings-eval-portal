Marseille marked the start of a new era on Sunday with a 3-0 victory over Auxerre in the French first division -- their second win over the European Cup quarter-finalists in six days . 
&quot; To beat the reigning French champions twice in the same week is an excellent performance . 
I could not have dreamed of a better start to my taking charge , &quot; said new chairman Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who officially took over the club on Friday . 
former French international Xavier Gravelaine put the 1993 European champions on course with a 39th minute goal , then fellow striker Marc Libbra and left back Hamada Jambay sealed the victory with two more in the last seven minutes . 
Marseille , who became the only French side to have won the European Cup under disgraced former chairman Bernard Tapie , also beat Auxerre 3-2 at home to put them out of the League Cup on Tuesday . 
Auxerre remain fifth in the standings , while Marseille climb from 13th to 10th , 15 points adrift of leaders Monaco but only five behind the defending champions after extending their unbeaten run in the league to seven matches . 
Marseille , who went through a poor patch earlier in their first season back from enforced relegation in 1994 over a match-rigging scandal under Tapie , have played some of their best matches against their biggest rivals . 
their recovery began with a 3-1 home win over Monaco on November 6 and they came away from the visit to Paris St-Germain last month with a 0-0 draw . 
Gravelaine took a through ball from midfielder Eric Roy , and slipped past Christian Henna into the penalty box on the left . 
the striker shot diagonally across goal just before Franck Silvestre &apos;s lunging tackle to slot the ball inside the far post beyond the diving Fabien Cool for his sixth goal of the season . 
Marseille survived Auxerre &apos;s push for an equaliser in the second half , then hit them on the break through Libbra , who looked marginally offside when he ran onto Italian defender Alberto Malusci &apos;s ball . 
Auxerre coach Guy Roux said : &quot; It &apos;s a shame that the second goal which put an end to the match should have been offside . 
our Marseillaise week has been bad . 
we conceded six goals , two of them sullied by illegality . 
it &apos;s a custom we thought had disappeared in Marseille . 
Roux believed one of Marseille &apos;s goals in the cup match should have been disallowed as well as Libbra &apos;s strike on Sunday . 
Jambay , who scored Marseille &apos;s third on Tuesday , surged past defender Frederic Danjou onto a pass by substitute Ludovic Asuar to shot past Cool from the left four minutes from time . 
Marseille coach Gerard Gili said : &quot; We managed to beat one of the European Cup favourites . 
we did so with a lot of aggression , especially in the duels . 
it was a good fight . 
Auxerre might have gone behind earlier when Cool had to change direction to stop a free kick from Roy that was deflected by the wall in the fifth minute . 
ten minutes later , Cool twisted back in midflight to push out a shot from Gravelaine deflected by midfielder Christian Henna &apos;s backside . 
Auxerre &apos;s best chances came in the second half when they took the game to Marseille . 
on the hour , Algerian midfielder Moussa Saib brought a diving save from Andreas Koepke , who also kept a clean sheet for Germany against Portugal 24 hours earlier . 
three minutes later , Nigerian defender Taribo West broke through the defence with only Koepke to beat but he pushed the ball too far forward allowing the keeper to reach it first .
