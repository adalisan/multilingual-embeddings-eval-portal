the South African rand was sticking close to the key psychological level of 4.50 toward Monday &apos;s close as players deliberated their next move after the the unit &apos;s sharp fall around midday . 
the local unit has come under pressure recently due to worries that the July 1 relaxation of exchange controls , which will give South Africans the freedom to invest in offshore markets for the first ime , might spark a flight of capital . 
&quot; The market has become a little bit nervous about the freeing up of exchange controls and the uncertainty about how its going to work and what sort of money &apos;s going to leave the country , &quot; said one dealer . 
it finally succumbed to market nerves and local and offshore rand selling around 1000 GMT , falling to a intraday low of 4.5040 bid before the Reserve Bank and exporters capped the weakness by offering dollar liquidity . 
the move over 4.50 was the rand &apos;s first in four months but market participants expressed relief the break didn &apos;t prompt a widely-feared barrage of stop-loss selling which might have carried the unit to around 4.60 . 
at 1430 GMT the rand was last at 4.5000 / 5030 from Friday &apos;s late level of 4.4830 / 4860 . 
against the crosses , the rand was last quoted at 0.3793 / 3797 marks from 0.3866 / 3869 Friday and at 7.3481 / 3575 on sterling from 7.2810 / 2904 previously . 
the unit was also last at 25.0194 / 0583 yen from 25.7324 / 7720 yen , having earlier hit a five month low of 24.9637 yen on the back of the Japanese unit &apos;s weekend gains against the dollar . 
South African debt began Monday in a cheery mood after central bank governor Chris Stals hinted at lower interest rates and U.S. treasuries moved sharply firmer . 
but the smiles faded as the rand began to slide , taking the benchmark R150 loan into the red in the afternoon . 
the bond was saved from logging a weaker day by a late buy order which saw it last quoted at 14.590 PCT from 14.615 Friday . 
Stals said over the weekend that lower interest rates were &quot; quite possible &quot; later this year against a backdrop of lower economic activity over the last six months . 
dealers said despite the positive flavour of Stals &apos; comments , the rand would be the key indicator of direction in coming days . 
on Tuesday the markets face April &apos;s producer price inflation figure which is expected to come in a touch lower from March . 
economists have called for a 9.5 percent year-on-year rise in the PPI in April from 9.6 percent in March . 
on the money market , three-month NCD rates were unchanged at 16.05 percent , while the 90-day BA rate was pegged at between 15.45 to 15.60 percent , also no different from Friday &apos;s late levels . 
South Africa &apos;s money market shortage inched up to 6.427 billion rand on Saturday from 6.408 billion rand on Friday and 6.472 billion rand on Thursday , the Reserve Bank said . 
bond Exchange figures showed foreigners were net buyers of 167.56 million rand &apos;s worth of South African bonds on Friday after selling 519.62 million rand &apos;s worth on Thursday . 
nominal cumulative bond market volumes were 5.08 billion rand on Friday from 41.3 billion rand on Thursday which was a settlement day
