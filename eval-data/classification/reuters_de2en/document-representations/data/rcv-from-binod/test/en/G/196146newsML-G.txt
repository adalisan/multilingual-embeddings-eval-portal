Romanian President Ion Iliescu will break new ground when , in the wake of his poll defeat , he hands over power to his reformist successor , an act none of his predecessors could manage . 
he will relinquish control to Emil Constantinescu , an academic with no career under the communists , in a peaceful transfer of power unprecedented in Romanian history and one that he campaigned hard to prevent . 
but the ex-communist decried by his opponents as a reluctant and unconvincing democrat was quick to admit defeat when it became clear voters wanted his seven years at the helm to end . 
&quot; I paid the price for this very complicated period through which the country has gone , &quot; the defeated Iliescu said minutes after television screens flashed exit poll results showing him trailing seven to eight points behind Constantinescu . 
he pledged to ensure a smooth handover , which could take place within days . 
&quot; I have responsibilities to guarantee peace and order in the country , so that the transfer of power be done in normal conditions , like in any democratic system . 
there has never been a democratic change of ruler in Romania . 
two communist leaders died of natural deaths , as did pre-war monarchs , while wartime leaders were removed in palace coups . 
Stalinist ruler Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted and shot in 1989 in what Iliescu &apos;s opponents charge was effectively a coup masterminded by the Moscow-educated functionary . 
it is a charge Iliescu hotly denies , repeating that the events of 1989 were a popular revolution , but his reputation has been stained by the deaths then and violent ethnic and political clashes in the early post-communist years . 
after Sunday &apos;s ballot Iliescu acknowledged Romanians had rejected the blend of paternalism and cautious reform he hoped would win him another four-year term in office . 
Iliescu will join his leftist Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) on the opposition benchs in Romania &apos;s Senate , following the PDSR &apos;s rout in parliamentary polls earlier this month . 
critics accepted Iliescu took his defeat with dignity , discarding the violent language of his campaign when he painted his rival as a closet monarchist who would bring back exiled ex-king Michael and pre-war landowners . 
the country is intact , democratic institutions have matured , we must carry on with our work , &quot; said the veteran leader . 
&quot; I congratulate Constantinescu and hope he will keep his promises , so that he will not disappoint his voters , &quot; said Iliescu , whose backers admire him as a skilful political survivor , and who calls himself &quot; a fighter . 
he said a spell in opposition would be good for his party , whose popularity has waned in the wake of corruption scandals and charges of mismanagement . 
&quot; There shall be no resentment or vendettas . 
and to rebuild around it the unity of centre-left forces , &quot; he said .
