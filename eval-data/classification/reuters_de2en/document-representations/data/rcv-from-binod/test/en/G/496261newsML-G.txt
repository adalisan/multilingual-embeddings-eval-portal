investigators have uncovered official records linking former South African president F.W. 
de Klerk to a 1986 plan to fight anti-apartheid guerrillas &quot; using their own methods &quot; , an official said on Wednesday . 
lawyer Howard Varney , convenor of an Investigative Task Board appointed to oversee a special police investigation into so-called &quot; third force &quot; activities under apartheid , told Reuters the records were part of a 150-page report handed to Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi . 
he said minutes written in Afrikaans record a discussion in the State Security Council , an inner cabinet set up to defend white rule , about a special counter-revolutionary third force to bolster the police and the army . 
&quot; The third force must be mobile with a well-trained capacity to effectively wipe out terrorists ... It must be prepared to be unpopular and even feared , &quot; the minutes said . 
&quot; The security forces must cooperate to form a third force so that the subversives can be countered using their own methods , &quot; the minutes said . 
the minutes do not record the methods envisaged . 
at the time the exiled African National Congress ( ANC ) was sending guerrillas into South Africa to plant bombs , attack government officials and discourage cooperation with the police . 
the ANC was legalised in February 1990 , its leader , Nelson Mandela , was freed after 27 years in jail and de Klerk began talks which led to the country &apos;s first democratic elections in April 1994 won by the ANC . 
Varney said minutes of the meeting chaired by then president P.W. 
Botha on May 12 , 1986 , showed that de Klerk , then minister of education , was present . 
&quot; Mr de Klerk was not a minister holding a security portfolio so you can &apos;t tie him to any specific counter-revolutionary actions , but he was present at the meeting . 
he can &apos;t claim to be ignorant of these things . 
&quot; In so far as he is claiming ignorance , I think that he may have a problem , &quot; he said . 
de Klerk denied at a news conference in Cape Town on March 23 that he had known anything about government-sponsored units set up to torture or kill apartheid foes . 
it &apos;s a lie that I was part of any conspiracy to do these terrible things ... to assassinate people , &quot; he said . 
de Klerk said there had been a cabinet discussion about a so-called third force to deal with riots and counter-insurgency operations , but that the idea was abandoned . 
Varney said his report was also sent to Archbishop Desmond Tutu &apos;s statutory Truth and Reconciliation Commission , which is trying to establish and record the history of human rights abuses in the fight over apartheid . 
on Wednesday , de Klerk issued copies of his written evidence to the truth commission , saying : &quot; After lengthy consideration , the ( Third Force ) proposal was rejected by the government . 
Tutu confirmed in a statement that his commission had received Varney &apos;s report , but had not had time to study it . 
the information would be fed into existing investigations and would contribute to the final report .
