human rights group Amnesty International on Wednesday slammed Kenya &apos;s rights record and warned that forthcoming general elections would not be free and fair unless constitutional reforms were carried out . 
Pierre sane , secretary-general of the London-based group , told a news conference at the end of a fact-finding tour to the east African nation that police brutality and torture were widespread and a number of people had died in police hands . 
sane , a Senegalese , said opposition leaders were subjected to arbitrary arrests and attempts have been made on their lives while political parties , non-governmental organisations and human rights groups were harrassed , sometimes violently . 
&quot; The situation is bad and it can become worse if these measures are not taken in the run-up to the elections , &quot; he said , urging restraint and dialogue between parties . 
&quot; Elections cannot be free and fair if people are intimidated , if people are harrassed and are not allowed to talk directly to voters , &quot; sane said . 
he described Kenya &apos;s political climate as one polluted by laws such as the Public Order Act which restrict freedom of association and threaten elections due this year . 
sane was speaking at the end of a two-week fact-finding tour of Kenya by Amnesty timed to coincide with the pre-election period . 
President Daniel arap Moi has called for presidential and parliamentary elections for later this year . 
but the opposition complains the country &apos;s constitution is tailored to the advantage of Moi &apos;s ruling Kenya African National Union ( KANU ) party and has called for amendments to reflect a pluralist environment . 
Moi has ruled out constitutional reforms before the elections and has vowed tough action against opposition politicians agitating for change . 
sane deplored an incident witnessed by his group on May 31 when heavily armed police violently broke up a peaceful opposition rally in Nairobi while failing to protect businesses from violent looting . 
drunken KANU youths also stopped Amnesty from addressing a civic education seminar in the northern town of Lodwar . 
but a campaign for a minimum package of constitutional reforms before elections has galvanised the opposition under the banner of the National Convention Assembly , which decided in April to hold &quot; illegal &quot; rallies in support of its campaign . 
senior government officials led by Moi have attacked the tone of Amnesty &apos;s criticisms and argued human rights are a matter of national sovereignty . 
&quot; The government has delayed its investigations of human rights violations , delayed prosecutions of those responsible and delayed legislative reforms . 
the people of Kenya have told us that they no longer believe in the government &apos;s promises , &quot; sane said . 
&quot; We believe that the violence that results from the application of these unjust laws will not allow the election to take place in a climate that is conducive to producing a legitimate government for tomorrow , &quot; sane added . 
Maina Kiai , executive director of Kenya Human Rights Commission , said rights had not improved since 1992 , when KANU won Kenya &apos;s first multi-party elections amid allegations of rigging and widespread political and ethnic violence . 
&quot; Our view is that it is impossible to have fair elections in the prevailing circumstances , &quot; Kiai told the news conference .
