U.S. millfeed prices were mostly steady on Monday in featureless markets , dealers said . 
there was no feature in the buffalo market , &quot; just the continued lack of ( flour mill ) runtime which seems to be keeping things fairly firm , &quot; a buffalo dealer said . 
in Minneapolis , spot prices were unchanged , bid at $ 57 a ton and offered at $ 63 a ton . 
&quot; This is a typical summer pattern . 
we got the rain , we got the pastures , &quot; a Minneapolis dealer said . 
the dealer was referring to adequate pasture land in the upper Midwest . 
&quot; The recent rain in Wisconsin and Minnesota has kept everything lush and green , &quot; he said . 
light weekend showers also fell in parts of Illinois and Indiana but more rain is forecast , weather Services Corp said . 
&quot; But once we get into the fall , then you would expect a pickup in demand , &quot; the Minneapolis dealer said .
