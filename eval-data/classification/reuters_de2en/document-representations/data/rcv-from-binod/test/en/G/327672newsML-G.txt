African mediators and mutineers in the Central African Republic struck a deal on Thursday to end the nation &apos;s third army mutunity in under a year , a spokesman for the mutineers said . 
lieutenant Parfait Mbay said the two sides would sign documents on Friday and a signing ceremony for all involved in a wider peace deal would take place on Saturday in the presence of the presidents of Gabon , Mali , Burkina Faso and Chad . 
news of the deal , brokered by Mali &apos;s respected former military leader Amadou Toumani Toure , emerged as a month long truce between the mutineers and their bitter rivals in the presidential guard expired . 
&quot; The soldiers in revolt and the international mediation committee agreed on an end to the mutiny and the signing of the documents will take place on Friday , &quot; Mbay told Reuters . 
Toumani Toure rallied Central African Republic &apos;s rival political factions and representatives from society at large around a peace blueprint and had been negotiating with the mutineers on their role under the peace blueprint . 
the blueprint envisages amnesties , a government of national unity and deployment of African peacekeepers to replace troops from former colonial power France who patrol flashpoints to keep army loyalists and mutineers apart . 
the four presidents launched the mediation bid in December at the behest of a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso . 
mutinies in April and May began over pay and conditions but turned into a campaign to oust Ange-Felix Patasse , a northern civilian politician who won presidential elections in 1993 . 
the latest mutiny , which began on November 15 , degenerated into ethnic feuding . 
the overall death toll runs into hundreds . 
the signing between the mutineers and the mediators will take place at 10 a.m. ( 0900 GMT ) on Friday at the residence of the Archbishop of Bangui , Joachim Ndayen .
