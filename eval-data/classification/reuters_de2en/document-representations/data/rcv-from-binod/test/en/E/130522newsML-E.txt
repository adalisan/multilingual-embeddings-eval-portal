a senior Philippine diplomat on Monday denied a report that Manila had offered to allow Taiwan to upgrade its representation at next month &apos;s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit . 
Ambassador Antonio Basilio told reporters that the Philippines would stick to the formula used at previous APEC summits , limiting APEC member Taiwan &apos;s representation to the level of economic minister . 
Basilio , vice chairman of a series of preparatory meetings by senior APEC officials , denied a report by Taiwan &apos;s Liberty Times that Manila had promised to upgrade Taipei &apos;s representation by allowing either Vice President LIEN Chan or Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh to attend . 
the newspaper had quoted unidentified government sources . 
&quot; We did not offer to upgrade their representation , &quot; Basilio told reporters . 
&quot; We will follow the formula . 
Philippine diplomats said that under the formula followed in previous APEC summits , Taiwan would be represented by an economics minister . 
LIEN &apos;s presence , or that of his deputy , at the APEC summit to be held in Subic free port north of Manila on November 25 would likely provoke APEC member China , which has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war separated them in 1949 . 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos has said previously Manila would follow the precedent set at previous APEC summits in deciding Taiwan &apos;s representation .
