NYMEX crude oil futures were expected to open 10 to 15 cents higher Wednesday , with products called flat to up 0.25 cent , on inventory data showing a sharp drop in crude stocks last week , traders said . 
inventory reports from American Petroleum Institute Tuesday and U.S. Energy Department this morning showed a drop of more than five million barrels of crude stocks . 
less significant inventory changes were seen in gasoline and distillates , and were not expected to lend clear direction for products in Wednesday &apos;s session . 
a surprising rise in capacity utilization , to 97.6 percent from 96.9 percent , could weigh on unleaded gas prices as production was seen challenging the market &apos;s ability to absorb supply . 
news the United States decided Tuesday to proceed with sanctions against Burma was drawing little attention this morning , traders said . 
the sanctions , which include prohibiting U.S. investment in the developments of Burma &apos;s oil fields , were tied to human rights issues . 
crude for July delivery was expected to get technical resistance initially at $ 22.12 / 15 per barrel , with firmer resistance seen at Friday &apos;s high of $ 22.43 . 
support was put at $ 21.50 , and $ 21.16 , just above the 10-day moving average of $ 21.13 .
