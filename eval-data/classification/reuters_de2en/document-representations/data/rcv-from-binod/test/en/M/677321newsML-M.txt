the UK spot natural gas prices saw prices firm slightly during trade in the morning , but levels eased back in the afternoon and ended little changed , traders and brokers said . 
one trader who sold gas in the third quarter and beyond said that prices had picked up in the morning as at least two big players came out to buy . 
one company was heard bidding for the gas year early on , although it was not clear if this was traded . 
and another was also buying quarters , and there was speculation that this company was also looking to put together blocks to make up a year . 
but one result of the market moving up slightly on these bids was that a number of sellers appeared , which capped the level to which prices could rise . 
activity was busy in the fourth , first and second quarters , with a number of trades seen done at the same price , especially in Q1 where 16.55 traded several times . 
and there was also an active market in prompt gas , with large volumes getting done on the within day market at Bacton and on the day ahead market at the NBP . 
but while the NBP was busy , St Fergus gas was barely talked . 
one seller at St Fergus reported doing no trade and taking barely any phone calls over the whole day . 
the IPE saw slightly better activity than in some recent days . 
the last trade was done outside the IPE &apos;s normal hours after trading was temporarily suspended following a fire alarm .
