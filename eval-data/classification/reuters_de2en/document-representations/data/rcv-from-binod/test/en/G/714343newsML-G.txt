a U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday that former Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega , who was convicted here in 1992 of drug-trafficking , should not get a new trial , his attorneys said . 
circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta found that Noriega &apos;s conviction would not have been altered if the jury had been told a federal witness had been paid $ 1.25 million by the Cali drug cartel to testify against him , defence lawyer Frank Rubino said . 
prosecutors have said the government had no knowledge of such bribery , and the witness in question has denied testifying in return for the cash . 
the Cali cartel was a rival of the Medellin drug cartel , also from Colombia , with which prosecutors said Noriega was linked . 
Rubino told Reuters the panel also had rejected arguments that Noriega should have enjoyed immunity as a head of state and was improperly brought to the United States . 
Noriega , now 63 , is serving a 40-year prison sentence for his conviction on eight of 10 counts in a drug-smuggling and racketeering indictment returned against him in 1989 by a federal grand jury in Miami . 
he was captured in early 1990 by U.S. forces who had invaded Panama on the orders of former U.S. President George Bush . 
Members of the prosecution team were not immediately available to comment on Monday &apos;s ruling . 
Rubino and fellow Noriega defence attorney Jon May said , however , that information had been disclosed to them in recent days that would lead them to take further legal steps in the coming days . 
&quot; We expect the Court of Appeals is going to be shocked when it learns the government relied on perjured testimony , &quot; May said , adding that Noriega &apos;s defence would make &quot; dramatic revelations &quot; as early as Thursday before the district and appeals courts dealing with the case . 
he declined to give details of the impending revelations . 
&quot; The fight is just beginning , &quot; May said . 
&quot; This is not the last word .
