September gilt futures will continue to move lower on Wednesday prompted by weakness in other bond markets , technical analysts said . 
&quot; The Bunds are very weak and T-bonds also look capable of going lower . 
that kind of background makes it very difficult for gilts although in isolation they do not so bad , &quot; said David Wood , an independant technical analyst near London . 
&quot; With the position on the Bund and T-bond at the moment there is every chance that we are going to reach 113-30 to 113-22 . 
on Tuesday , Wood said gilts had come to rest on a trend channel which would come in around 114-07 for this session . 
but pressure from other markets was likely to force gilts lower . 
he said the high 113s had been a good area of support in early July . 
&quot; We look pretty soft today below 114-13 , 17 area , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But we shouldn &apos;t go through that big support in the high 113s , it seems too aggresive . 
to the upside , Wood said if the contract managed to break and hold above 114-13 there was a tough band of resistance from 114-27 up to 115-00 . 
&quot; That ought to cap the upside and it will be a bit of a grind to get up there , &quot; he said . 
technical analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London also said the 114-13 , 17 region would revert to resistance and prevent initial upticks extending to 114-27 , 28 . 
&quot; It would take a recovery above the latter to leave a more supportive tone , while a rotation above the 115-11 level would be needed to revive potential to retest the contract highs , &quot; they said in a research note . 
they did not favour a recovery and said losses through 114-00 looked increasingly likely . 
&quot; Once this gives way look for more aggressive declines to 113-16 , and even 113-01 / 112-19 , &quot; they said . 
at the short end , December short sterling was at 92.53 , up three basis points on the day .
