mother Teresa has virtually decided not to contest the post of superior general of her Roman Catholic order as hectic preperations are on for its elections on February 2 , an aide said on Sunday . 
&quot; It is the God , who will now decide my successor , &quot; the associate of the 86-year-old Nobel peace prize winner quoted her as saying late last week . 
the legendary nun founded her Calcutta-based missionaries of Charity order in 1948 and has led it since then with charisma . 
but frail health has made it increasingly difficult for her to run the order anymore , her aides said . 
&quot; Mother Teresa does not want to continue as superior general because of her poor health and a weak heart , &quot; said a spokewoman of the order . 
mother Teresa &apos;s health deteriorated in the 1980s . 
in 1989 , she was fitted with a pacemaker . 
a year later , the Vatican announced she was resigning as head of her missionaries of Charity order . 
delegates from the order arrived in Calcutta from around the world to elect a successor . 
they asked her to stay . 
she did . 
she was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia in 1991 . 
she spent three weeks in hospital in August and September 1996 for heart trouble , malaria and pneumonia . 
she was in hospital again in November 1996 . 
several heart failures and surgery to unblock two coronary arteries followed . 
even the doctors , who have treated her since 1991 , were not very optimistic about her full recovery . 
&quot; She is still in the high risk zone with heart , kidney and lung problems and any infection at this stage can be fatal , &quot; said Tarun Praharaj , a doctor who treated her in 1993 and last year . 
&quot; Even now she is not well and is suffering from severe pain along her spine and the doctor says she has a bent spine which is affecting her nerves and causing pains , &quot; the order &apos;s spokeswoman said . 
earlier in September a poll to elect a successor was delayed when Mother Teresa was in hospital . 
the order &apos;s constitution says if the superior general dies or is unable to perform her duties , the assistant general or second-in-charge will take over , pending a fresh election within 90 days . 
Maltese-born Sister Frederica , in her 60s , is the current assistant general . 
in 1990 , she replaced Sister Agnes Das , a Bengali nun and Mother Teresa &apos;s first disciple in the charity . 
apart from a superior general , a four-member council , including an assistant general , is also elected . 
the charity voted for the first time in 1961 . 
the election process begins with forming an electoral college , mainly with representatives from various sections of the order , including the regions , postulants and novices . 
the college , or General Chapter , meeting is preceded by a retreat to allow its 103 members &quot; to communicate with God and vote according to God &apos;s will &quot; . 
the spokeswoman said the eight-day retreat is scheduled to begin on January 16 . 
&quot; After the retreat is over the General Chapter will have several rounds of meetings before the election by secret ballot on February 2 , &quot; she said .
