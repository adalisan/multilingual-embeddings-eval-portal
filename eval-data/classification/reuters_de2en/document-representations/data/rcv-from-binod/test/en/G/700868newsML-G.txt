U.N. Security Council members on Monday called on Congo authorities to cooperate with U.N. human rights investigators , with some envoys urging senior U.N. officials to help in negotiations with President Laurent Kabila . 
the planned probe follows allegations that Kabila &apos;s Tutsi- backed rebels or their Rwandan or Ugandan allies killed Rwandan Hutu refugees as they marched across the former Zaire before toppling president Mobutu Sese Seko in May . 
&quot; The members expressed their concern ( and ) the need for the Democratic Republic of the Congo authorities to fully cooperate with the investigation team , &quot; said Council President Sergei Lavrov of Russia after a closed-door meeting . 
diplomats at the meeting said some delegations suggested that the council , which had adopted a resolution urging the investigation be conducted , should support a U.N. human rights team in negotiating with Kabila &apos;s officials or ask for envoys from U.N. headquarters to go to the Congo . 
they said U.N. officials outlined three main problems : 
-- the refusal of Kabila to accept Chilean lawyer Roberto Garreton as a member of the mission 
--a demand that the group investigate atrocities against refugees that may have occurred before October 1996 when Mobutu was still in power and before Kabila &apos;s allies became active in eastern Zaire 
--difficulties in logistics and freedom of movement for the investigators . 
apparently U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , in talks with Kabila in early June , had discussed Garreton &apos;s removal from the investigation , a move that has outraged human rights groups as well as several council delegations . 
one European envoy , who spoke on condition of anonymity , noted that Garreton had been the special rapporteur or investigator for the area since 1994 . 
if he were cut from the team , other countries under U.N. scrutiny , such as Iran , Iraq or Burma could make the same demand . 
other envoys said the United Nations should consider broadening its investigation to the dates Kabila &apos;s envoys had suggested if it meant that Garreton could participate . 
Lavrov would not give details , saying only that the council would continue to follow the issue . 
an advance U.N. team in the capital Kinshasa said on Sunday that the government had rejected terms for the investigation , set down in April in a resolution of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights . 
the main body of researchers was due to arrive on July 7 but is unlikely to make it . 
a previous attempt to visit the country in May was also blocked . 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has said 250,000 Hutus who had lived in camps in Zaire since 1994 are unaccounted for . 
another 800,000 went home after their camps were overrun .
