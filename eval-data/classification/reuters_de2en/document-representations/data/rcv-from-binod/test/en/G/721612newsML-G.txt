Britain &apos;s coxless four , who won the Stward &apos;s Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta last week , gave one of the most impressive performances of the opening day of the inaugural World rowing Cup on Friday . 
the crew , comprising quadruple Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave with former partner Matthew Pinsent along with bronze medallist Tim Foster and international James Cracknell , won their heat comfortably to qualify direct for Sunday &apos;s final and extend their unbeaten record in the four to seven races and the Redgrave / Pinsent phenomenal winning streak to 68 . 
the French crew , comprising three former world champions , and the new Italian four , competing for the first time in the World Cup , both failed to qualify directly and must race in repechages on Saturday . 
a huge entry of more than 1,000 rowers from 41 countries are taking part in the event , the third and last of the three regatta series . 
German crews , the overall leaders after two events , again performed strongly qualifying ten crews for the next stage of competition . 
but their eight failed to beat Australia in their event . 
the Australians , who beat Germany , the World Cup leaders , in Paris three weeks ago , qualified directly for the final but Germany finished behind Romania in the second heat and must race in the repechages . 
Iztok COP ( Slovenia ) , the World Cup leader in the single sculls , won his heat to move through to Saturday &apos;s semi-finals as did third ranked Frederik Bekken ( Norway ) and fourth placed Andris Reinholds ( Latvia ) . 
surprisingly Egypt &apos;s Ibrahim Ali , ranked second overall , was beaten by American Jamie Koven and must race in the repechages . 
the heats of the women &apos;s single sculls produced no major upsets with Olympic champion and World Cup leader Katya Khodotovitch ( Belarus ) qualifying with ease . 
also through is former world champions Trine Hanseen of Denmark although Maria Brandin of Sweden has to go through the repechages . 
thunderstorm interrupted racing during the afternoon causing a 30 minute delay and the re-race of one of the men &apos;s single sculls heat . 
the repechages and semi-finals take place Saturday with the finals on Sunday . 
Germany lead the World Cup overall standings after two events with 139 points , ahead of Britain , France and Romania .
