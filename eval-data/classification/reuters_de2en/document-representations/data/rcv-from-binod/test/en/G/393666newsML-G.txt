five Spanish NATO peacekeeers escaped injury when their armoured vehicle was hit by an anti-tank rocket in a Croat sector of Mostar overnight , a NATO spokesman said on Friday . 
&quot; It is a blatant challenge to us ... we will take whatever action is necessary to remove a potential threat , &quot; Major Tony White , of the NATO-led Stabilisation Force ( SFOR ) , said . 
&quot; SFOR responded to the attack by deploying a quick-reaction force to the scene and our presence in the area has been substantially increased , with increased patrols . 
the response team failed to find the attackers but recovered two used rocket launcher canisters about 100 metres ( yards ) from where the NATO vehicle was hit . 
Mostar was a scene of bitter Moslem-Croat fighting in 1993 which left the city divided into hostile Moslem and Croat sectors . 
Moslems and Croats complained to the United Nations police in Mostar of shots being traded across the Neretva river on Thursday afternoon , spokesman Alex Ivanko said . 
the U.N. could not confirm this report . 
Ivanko said a large explosion shook a disco club in west Mostar on Thursday afternoon , causing no casualties but inflicting substantial property damage . 
in Sarajevo , two grenades caused minor damage to a Roman Catholic church in a mainly-Moslem part of the city on Thursday evening .
