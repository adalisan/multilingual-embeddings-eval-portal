Hungarian share prices closed mostly lower on the Budapest Stock Exchange on Thursday , defying expectations for an overall rise on the market . 
&quot; Today &apos;s session caused some surprise , &quot; said Peter Lencs of MKB Securities . 
&quot; One expected the whole market to rise after the Federal Reserve left its interest rates unchanged and also one expected a more serious rise after MOL &apos;s results . 
despite bullish expectations after good nine-month results , shares of oil and gas company MOL closed only 30 forints higher , at 1,650 , below the day &apos;s peak of 1,670 . 
Lencs was not particularly optimistic about the bourse &apos;s short-term outlook saying the market apparently ran out of steam and became unable to take advantage from positive news . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we could expect signficant rises or falls in the near term , the market will be flat , &quot; he said . 
shares of other companies releasing January-September results today , traded mixed . 
tile manufacturer Zalakeramia closed at 6,800 forints , down 50 , while spirits maker Zwack remained untraded . 
on Thursday trading was suspended in the shares of research and development company Horizon-Multiplan . 
the BSE decided to suspend trading in the shares to protect the interest of investors who may have not received important information about the company &apos;s expected 1996 results . 
on Thursday two Hungarian dailies published Horizon-Multiplan business figures based on the company &apos;s statement , while the official bourse gazette received the information too late to publish it on Thursday .
