the key September 10-year Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures contract is expected to rise toward 125.00 on Wednesday after good results of Tuesday &apos;s 10-year JGB auction , traders said . 
the market has discounted the BOJ &apos;s forecast for the diffusion index for major manufacturers in the June tankan of minus one , traders said . 
the upward room will be limited if the actual result is the same as these , &quot; said a dealer at a city bank &apos;s securities unit . 
&quot; But if the June Di is lower and the September Di is negative , a further rise toward 125.00 is likely , &quot; he said . 
a dealer at a trust bank &apos;s securities unit said a worsening in the tankan may boost the September but added that its rise may be technically barred at around 125.00 for Wednesday . 
if the tankan shows an improvement , that would take the market off guard and trigger aggressive selling , traders said . 
&quot; If the tankan shows an unexpected improvement and the market realises that there is possibility of higher interest rates in the October-December period , the September contract may plunge by two yen or so and fall below 123.00 , &quot; the first dealer said .
