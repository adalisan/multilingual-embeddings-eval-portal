England , led by Darren Gough , completed their rout of New Zealand before lunch on the second day of the second test on Friday but received an early setback when opener Nick Knight was out before the break . 
England were 20 for one at lunch with skipper Mike Atherton on seven and Alec Stewart on five . 
England had New Zealand on the ropes at 56 for six wickets on the rain-shortened first day and completed the job 40 minutes before lunch to have the kiwis out for 124 . 
a fired up Darren Gough got his second five wicket-bag in tests , ending with the fine figures of five for 40 off 16 overs . 
he received excellent support from New Zealand-raised Andy Caddick , who finished with four for 45 in his first test of the Zimbabwe-New Zealand tour . 
new Zealand found batting easier the previous evening but when Nathan Astle was on 36 he lofted a catch to Robert Croft at mid-off . 
two balls later wicketkeeper Stewart got his fourth catch of innings when Simon Doull was out for a duck . 
umpire Steve Bucknor spoke to Atherton about Gough &apos;s aggression at one stage . 
Geoff Allott edged Dominic Cork to second slip where Nick Knight took the catch . 
then 18-year-old new cap Daniel Vettori had to withstand a bumper burst from Cork . 
Dipak Patel , who had taken boundaries in consecutive balls from Caddick through square leg and long on , miscued an attempted pull at the same Bowler and spooned a catch to mid-off . 
his 45 -- the top score of the New Zealand innings -- came off 66 balls and included six fours , and the ease with which he batted suggested England could build a big score . 
the England openers appeared to find batting easier than the New Zealanders but Knight flashed at a wide ball from Doull and was taken by Patel in the gully to leave England 20 for one .
