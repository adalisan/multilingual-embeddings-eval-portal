German IBIS DAX index was up in late trade on Monday , lifted by a strong banking sector , but most attention was focused on this evening &apos;s FOMC meeting , which is expected to lead to a U.S. interest rate hike . 
the rise in the banking sector comes on the same day as thousands of workers hit the streets to protest at what they termed the poker-style game of takeovers in the German steel industry . 
Deutsche Bank was up 3.31 percent at 91.38 marks in late IBIS DAX trade , with dealers putting the rise down to continued speculation about mergers in the sector . 
however , dealers said they were surprised at the banking sector &apos;s resilience following the failure of the attempted takeover of the giant engineer Thyssen AG by the smaller Krupp-Hoesch . 
&quot; The performance of the banks is all the more remarkable today given the disgraceful failure of Germany &apos;s first hostile takeover , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; The banks have fallen flat on their faces , &quot; another said . 
there was a level of market disappointment that the so-called &quot; superdeal &quot; had not come through . 
&quot; They wanted to set an example with this superdeal , to show that these kind of coups are possible in Germany , &quot; he said . 
another trader said : &quot; The steel sector tried to show with this takeover bid just what could have been possible . 
&quot; shares in Thyssen were down 8.77 percent in afternoon IBIS at 374.50 marks . 
Krupp was down 1.93 percent at 330.50 marks . 
Deutsche was also in the news when it said it and Hochtief planned to pool their shares in Philipp Holzmann . 
Hochtief shares were up 85 pfennigs , around 1.2 percent , at 72.25 marks , off earlier highs , while Holzmann advanced 17 marks , 3.19 percent , to 550 marks . 
sales of 52.3 billion marks in 1996 and a strong sales outlook for 1997 boosted shares in luxury carmaker BMW AG by 50.50 marks , or 4.24 percent , to 1,242.50 marks . 
pharmaceutical group Merck KGaA was up 2.15 marks , or 3.26 percent , at 68.15 marks after it said its 1996 net profit rose 36 percent to 502 million marks . 
BHF Bank shares were steady at 43.20 marks , up 45 pfennigs or around one percent , in afternoon trade . 
the second-tier bank reported a five percent decline in operating profit for 1996 amid heavy pressure on its lending business and from its involvement with the AGIV industrial holding company .
