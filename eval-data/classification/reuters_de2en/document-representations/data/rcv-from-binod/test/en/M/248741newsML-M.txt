State Bank of Mauritius boosted trading at the Mauritius bourse on Wednesday , apparently on foreign investor buying , dealers said . 
the market index , semdex , gained 1.82 points to 330.84 while traded volume surged to 29.76 million rupees on 2,105,709 shares from 8.32 million rupees on 454,923 shares on Monday . 
a big deal on State Bank was the major talk on the bourse trading floor -- as it accounted for most of the day &apos;s volume . 
stocks of the second largest Mauritian bank climbed 20 cents to an all time high of 9.20 rupees on 1,143,750 shares . 
&quot; Foreign investors like this stock . 
it is one of the most liquid on the market and the bank &apos;s fundamentals enjoy a good reputation , &quot; said the manager of a stockbroking concern . 
another big volume was also seen on commerce-based Happy World Foods which fell 60 cents to 17 rupees on 539,260 shares . 
&quot; Happy World Foods jumped by 4.8 percent during the last trading session to land at 17.60 rupees . 
this was probably too rapid for the stock in one go and explains the correction of today , &quot; a broker said . 
the broker added there had been interest in Happy World Foods during the past week as volume was above average for the stock which gained 11.4 percent in three trading sessions . 
moving shares in the rest of the market were mostly on an upward general trend despite the absence of fresh market moving news as the end of year festivities were approaching . 
&quot; At the moment , trading is rather characterised by big deals which are being made on blue chip stocks from time to time , &quot; the broker said . 
Mauritius Commercial Bank was unchanged at 73.50 rupees on 34,029 shares and British American Insurance gained 10 cents to 7.50 rupees on 146,250 shares . 
in the investment sector , Promotion And Development ( pad ) gained 50 cents to 15.50 rupees on 4,497 shares and Fincorp Investment was up 1.50 rupees to 73 on 4,122 shares .
