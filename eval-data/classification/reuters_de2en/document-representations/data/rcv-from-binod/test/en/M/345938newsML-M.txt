the peseta opened a bit stronger on Thursday versus the mark , supported by a firmer lira as the mark slipped on profit-taking against some Europeans . 
Spanish dealers added that fear of intervention by the Bank of Spain , which yesterday was rumoured to have bought pesetas against the mark , were also supporting the Spanish currency . 
&quot; Yesterday the Bank of Spain apparently bought pesetas at around 84.60 versus the mark and now there is the fear that it could happen again if we reach that level , &quot; a trader in Madrid said . 
at 0915 GMT , the peseta was trading at around 84.44 / 46 versus the mark , stronger than the opening level of 84.57 / 60 and than yesterday &apos;s close at around 84.56 / 59 .
