Poland &apos;s parliament gave final approval on Wednesday to a new constitution to replace the current Communist-era charter eight years after the fall of the old regime . 
it will be put to a referendum and , if approved , come into effect three months after being signed by the president . 
the proposed new basic law guarantees civil and economic liberties , free health care and education , and keeps the state and the powerful Roman Catholic church separated . 
the national assembly of both houses of parliament voted 451 to 40 with six abstentions to adopt the constitution , after accepting most of the amendments proposed by President Aleksander Kwasniewski . 
&quot; This an exceptional and moving moment ... a historic decision has been taken , &quot; Kwasniewski told deputies after they sang the Polish national anthem . 
he said he would call the referendum for May 25 . 
once approved , it would replace the current Stalin-era 1952 charter amended by many , often unclear interim laws . 
&quot; The constitution guarantees ... legal order , democratic and effective government and strengthens independence of the courts , &quot; Kwasniewski said . 
the constitution has become a battleground in the run-up to general elections , due around September , pitting the ruling coalition dominated by ex-communists against right-wing groups outside parliament . 
these groups , which include the powerful Solidarity Electoral Action , put forward their own draft constitution , which adheres to religious values and bans abortion . 
they want Poles to choose in the referendum between their draft and parliament &apos;s . 
but deputies say this is not possible without amending the current laws on legislative procedures , for which there is no time . 
the most radical opposition group , the Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland , has urged voters to reject the parliament-backed constitution . 
a recent opinion poll by public CBOS agency showed that 41 percent of Poles would support parliament &apos;s constitution , 15 percent would reject it while the rest were undecided . 
many economists have criticised the draft constitution for including too many social safety net provisions and paving the way for a welfare state which the meagre national budget cannot afford . 
the charter guarantees free publicly-funded basic health care , free basic education for all Poles and a minimum wage . 
it obliges the government to act to curb unemployment and stimulate housing construction . 
&quot; unrealistic promises of social security should not exist in the constitution , &quot; said Bohdan Wyznikiewicz , senior analyst at the Market Economy Research Institute . 
but Wyznikiewicz and other analysts praised the constitution for capping the public debt at 60 percent of gross domestic product and forbidding the government to finance the budget deficit through the central bank . 
the constitution would also slightly weaken the presidency , with parliament allowed to overthrow the president &apos;s veto by three-fifths of votes in the lower house rather than the present two-thirds majority . 
it would also ban fascist , communist and racist political parties . 
the right says the current parliament , elected in 1993 and dominated by parties with communist roots -- the Democratic Left Alliance and the Peasant Party -- has no moral right to approve the constitution for a democratic Poland .
