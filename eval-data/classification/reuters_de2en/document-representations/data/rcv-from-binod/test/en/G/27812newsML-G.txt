tropical storm-force winds of 40 mph ( 64 kph ) and several inches of rain lashed the tourist haven , forecasters said . 
&quot; The hurricane is expected to remain offshore . 
however the center has been wobbly for the last couple of hours so it &apos;s still possible its center could come in over southeast New England , &quot; said meterologist Mike Carbone of the National weather Service in Taunton , Mass . 
at 11 p.m. EDT on Sunday 0300 GMT , the center of Hurricane Edouard was located about 125 miles ( 201 km ) south of Nantucket Island , and moving north northeast at 14 mph ( 22 kph ) , Carbone said .
