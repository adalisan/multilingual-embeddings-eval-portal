German share prices remained buoyant on Monday as export-led stocks like carmakers and chemicals companies were boosted by the dollar which hit a new seven-and-a-half year high against the mark . 
the IBIS DAX index , which reflects electronic dealing in 30 blue-chip shares , rose as much as one percentage point to a session high of 4,423.74 in early trade before paring gains to trade at 4,407.61 at 0745 GMT , up 0.89 percent or 38.84 points from Friday &apos;s close . 
dealers said the market had calmed down from last week &apos;s turbulence but predicted further gains were in store . 
the prospect of further mark weakening should continue to support the stock market but the likelihood of temporary setbacks is growing , analysts said . 
&quot; .... we see the long-term upward trend on the bourse as remaining stable , &quot; analysts at Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG wrote in a note to investors . 
&quot; signs of interim technical corrections have strengthened recently but the corrections should be limited . 
weak days therefore continue to be suited to appropriate portfolio increases . 
German daily Handelsblatt on Monday said leading bankers were predicting further share price gains as the environment for the stock market was , in the words of chief executive Martin Kohlhaussen , &quot; the best of all worlds &quot; . 
corporate earnings are rising amid low-inflation growth and historically low interest rates , while Germany &apos;s savers appear finally to have acknowledged equities as a viable investment . 
Handelsblatt also quoted Hartmuth Jung , head of German corporate finance at BZW , the investment banking arm of Barclays plc , as saying the current rally could drive the DAX above 5,000 points . 
chemical , engineering and carmaking stocks were among the favourites on Monday , helped by the dollar which was trading at 1.8435 marks in morning European trade . 
the U.S. unit earlier hit 1.8470 marks , its highest level in seven-and-a-half years . 
electrical giant Siemens AG rose almost five percent to a new year high of 131.60 marks , gaining from positive analysts &apos; assessments in the wake of nine-month results published least week .
