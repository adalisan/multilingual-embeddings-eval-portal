Miami Mayor Joe Carollo told Florida Gov. 
Lawton Chiles the city &apos;s deficit is worse than previously disclosed , and that he would welcome a state takeover of the city , The Miami Herald reported Wednesday . 
Mayor Joe Carollo spoke to the newspaper late Tuesday night , after returning from what he described as &quot; a heart to heart &quot; with Chiles in Tallahassee . 
Carollo said he and Chiles also discussed the possibility of declaring bankruptcy under Chapter 9 , but that going into bankruptcy now would be premature . 
a bankruptcy declaration would allow the city to nullify union contracts , renegotiate city leases , privatize garbage services and restructure debt payments . 
Carollo said he believes Miami &apos;s deficit is much worse than the previously estimated $ 68 million . 
&quot; The deficit is much greater . 
there are additional millions . 
we really don &apos;t know where they are , &quot; the newspaper quoted him as saying . 
neither city officials nor the governor were immediately available for comment Wednesday . 
the newspaper said Carollo also formally notified Chiles that the city had a &quot; financial emergency , &quot; which the city declared on Oct 7 . 
the declaration could allow the governor to appoint a financial emergency board to take over fiscal management of the city , something no Florida governor has ever done . 
&quot; I &apos;m not at all opposed to having an advisory board , &quot; Carollo told the newspaper . 
&quot; If anything it might be refreshing . 
&quot; When New York went thorugh its problems , the governor there put in an oversight board and look at New York -- it came back stronger than ever . 
we need to rebuild Miami top to bottom and change the Third World system that was running this city for so long , Carollo told the Herald .
