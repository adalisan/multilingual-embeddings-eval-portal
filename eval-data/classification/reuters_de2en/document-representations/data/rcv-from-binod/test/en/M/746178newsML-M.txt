MGE spring wheat futures were higher in active midsession dealings but were lagging gains in other U.S. wheat markets because of strong commercial selling , traders said . 
U.S. wheat markets firmed early on news Egypt bought 450,000 tonnes of U.S. soft red winter wheat . 
wheat drew further support on follow-through buying from Monday &apos;s strong close . 
but spring wheat was seeing pressure as commercial players unraveled their spreads between Minneapolis and the two other U.S. wheat futures markets in Kansas City and Chicago . 
&quot; We &apos;re seeing good commercial selling in our Sept and Dec , &quot; an MGE trader said . 
&quot; People have been long Minneapolis and short the other markets , and I think they &apos;re starting to unwind those positions . 
it makes sense because their harvests are almost over and ours is just around the corner . 
traders said prudential Securities sold two million each of Sept and Dec wheat . 
country Hedhing sold two million Dec and a million Sept . 
traders said speculative money was on the buy side , with Benson-Quinn and Cargill investor Services each picking up around one million Sept bushels .
