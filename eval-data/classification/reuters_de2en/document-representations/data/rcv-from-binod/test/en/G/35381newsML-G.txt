Chancellor Franz Vranitzky on Thursday sought to assuage Austrian fears about cooperating with Europe on security matters and promised that Austria &apos;s neutrality would not be &quot; sold off &quot; . 
the Social Democrat leader , whose party rules as senior coalition partner with the conservative People &apos;s Party , told callers to a national hotline that promoting peace and security in Europe did not mean joining a military alliance . 
&quot; It &apos;s about building up a common security structure , as a member of the European Union , together with the other 14 states so we can confront our dangers together , &quot; he said . 
the contentious issue of joining NATO has been the subject of frequent and heated debate among Austria &apos;s political parties since the country joined the European Union in 1995 . 
the political right has generally argued for a swift decision , while the pro-neutrality left insists the question must be decided by a national referendum . 
recent polls have shown only about 23 percent of Austrians favour NATO membership . 
Austria , perched on the traditional border between the feuding eastern and western blocs , has been neutral since 1955 , when it inaugurated its post-World War Two constitution . 
the Soviet Union , which occupied Austria after the war with allies Britain , France and the United States , demanded Austria enshrine neutrality as a central pillar of its national charter before it agreed to withdraw its troops .
