Cubans are the least favourably regarded of recent immigrant groups in the United States , followed closely by Mexicans , according to a newspaper poll published on Monday . 
thirty-five percent of longtime Americans had an unfavourable opinion of Cubans , 18 percent had a favourable opinion and 23 percent had a neutral opinion , a Princeton Survey Research Associates poll for the Miami Herald found . 
greater Miami is home to some 800,000 people of Cuban extraction . 
thirty-four percent had an unfavourable view of Mexicans , followed by 30 percent for immigrants from the Middle East , 29 percent for Caribbean islanders including Haitians , 19 percent for Chinese , 18 percent for Africans and Japanese and 12 percent for Europeans . 
the nationwide poll measured opinions of 1,314 U.S. citizens and people who came to the United States before 1980 . 
conducted between May 2 and 26 , it had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent . 
the most well regarded immigrant groups were Europeans , followed by Japanese , Africans and Chinese . 
negative opinions about Cubans appeared to be linked to media portrayals of immigration and crime , pollsters found . 
&quot; People are basically telling us what they are seeing in the media , &quot; Larry Hugick , supervisor of the poll , said . 
Mexicans account for the largest minority group in the country with 27 percent of foreign-born residents . 
Cubans represent 3 percent . 
Silvia Pedraza , a Cuban-American sociologist at the University of Michigan , told the Herald an older , favourable image of Cubans had changed after the 1980 Mariel boatlift , during which thousands of Cuban criminals joined refugees leaving the communist-ruled island for Florida . 
many of those who viewed Cuban , Mexican , Middle Eastern and Caribbean immigrants negatively also believed the government helped immigrants too much and that immigrants took the jobs of Americans , the poll found .
