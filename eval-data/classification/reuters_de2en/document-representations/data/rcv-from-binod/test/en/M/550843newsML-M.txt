&quot; Between 75,000 and 80,000 in fresh sales is more than what we need to reach 7.0 million bales , &quot; Smith Barney analyst David Brandon said , referring to USDA &apos;s export target for the 1996 / 97 crop . 
Brandon noted talk of overnight buying from Brazil and Turkey . 
these sales would not appear in Thursday &apos;s report , however .
