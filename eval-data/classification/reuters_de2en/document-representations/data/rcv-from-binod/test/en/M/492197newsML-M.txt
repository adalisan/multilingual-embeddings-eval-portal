German call money rates traded slightly softer on Monday at 3.10 percent in calm conditions . 
the bulk of trades was conducted at 3.10 percent compared with Friday &apos;s range of 3.10 / 3.125 percent , dealers said , adding that monthly reserve holdings at the Bundesbank still looked comfortable . 
&quot; Reserve holdings can &apos;t be bad , after all there was very little interest in obtaining funds late Friday afternoon , &quot; a dealer said . 
for the next several sessions , dealers predicted rates would remain at current levels . 
as the Bundesbank has kept its main money market rate , the repo , steady at three percent since August , dealers see little chance of rates moving much below the 3.10 percent level . 
&quot; Some really brave people may attempt to push rates down , but whether they will be successful will depend on where they are calling from , &quot; said one dealer . 
on Friday banks held 41.1 billion marks in reserve at the Bundesbank , down from 42.1 billion marks held on Thursday . 
meanwhile holdings for the month slipped to 42.0 billion marks from 42.8 billion marks . 
Lombard borrowings were negligible . 
the Frankfurt Interbank overnight average was set at 3.12633 percent on Monday after 3.13433 percent on Friday .
