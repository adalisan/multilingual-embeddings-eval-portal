UNESCO chief Federico Mayor , voicing concern over discrimination against women under the new Afghan government , urged the radical Moslem Taleban militia on Monday to be tolerant . 
Mayor , Director General of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation , said he was disturbed by reports that women were being denied equal rights to education and work since the Taleban took over Kabul last week . 
&quot; While respecting the rights of the Afghan people to freely chose their government , I want to remind their new leaders of the importance of creating an atmosphere in which tolerance of different ethnic , gender and political groups can prevail , &quot; Mayor said . 
the Taleban , or religious Islamic pupils , began enforcing a fundamentalist brand of Islam and have yet to announce if women will be allowed to resume their jobs . 
they promised to govern according to Islamic Sharia law , including punishments such as death for murder , stoning for adultery and amputation for theft .
