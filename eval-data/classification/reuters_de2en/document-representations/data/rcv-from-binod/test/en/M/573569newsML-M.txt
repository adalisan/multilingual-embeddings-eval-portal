the yen will likely rise further against the dollar given political factors now seen as key to exchange rate moves , economists and dealers said on Friday . 
market players are shifting their attention to worries over Japan &apos;s rising trade surplus gap with the United States and away from the U.S.-Japan interest rate gap which had fuelled the dollar &apos;s rally earlier this year , they said . 
&quot; Market attention is finally shifting to the trade issue , &quot; said Richard C. Koo , a senior economist at Nomura Research Institute Ltd . 
&quot; pushing the yen higher would be the only option for Japanese authorities right now to avoid a rise in the external imbalance and calls from the United States to stimulate domestic demand , &quot; he added . 
the dollar slid below 123 yen in Tokyo on Friday , the first time it had dropped below that level since April 4 . 
the latest fall meant the greenback was down nearly 3.8 percent from its peak of 127.47 yen hit on May 1 . 
market analysts said Japanese authorities appeared keen to bolster the yen ahead of a Group of Seven ( G7 ) leaders &apos; summit in Denver in June , so as to head off trade friction with Washington . 
&quot; The yen will likely strengthen further on a short-term horizon , led by political incentives , &quot; said an official at the finance department of a major Japanese carmaker . 
&quot; There is a strong political intention by the government to push the dollar down from the 125 yen level ahead of Denver summit . 
Japanese officials including the Finance Ministry &apos;s Eisuke Sakakibara , known as &quot; Mr yen &quot; for his influence in currency markets , are keeping up a steady stream of comments in hinting at possible dollar-selling intervention by central banks . 
such intervention , the official at the Japanese carmaker said ( corrects to clarify identity of official ) , could topple the dollar to below 120 yen if it materialised . 
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto vowed to avoid a resurgence of Japan &apos;s trade surplus with the United Sates by promoting domestic demand-led growth when he met U.S. President Bill Clinton last month . 
U.S. exporters have been complaining that the weak yen was hurting their competitiveness abroad . 
Japan &apos;s trade surplus with the United States has been rising over the past six months , increasing 11.2 percent to $ 3.04 billion in March alone . 
given Tokyo &apos;s determination to cut public spending and get its budget deficit under control , boosting the yen looks like the only way to rein in the trade surplus , economists said . 
a stronger yen would make Japanese exports less competitive overseas while making imports into Japan cheaper . 
expectations that the U.S.-Japan interest rate gap may narrow due to an earlier-than-expected rise in Japanese interest rates are also boosting the yen against the dollar . 
markets are now speculating the Bank of Japan could tighten credit as early as July , although many economists dismiss that as unlikely . 
meanwhile , Japanese exporters -- caught off guard by the dollar &apos;s sudden tumble -- have been forced to join a wave of dollar sales to protect their overseas earnings , dealers said . 
&quot; Some exporters who had taken a relaxed stance until yesterday were pressed ... to arrange their dollar sales today , &quot; said Wataru ITO , deputy general manager at the treasury department of Sanwa Bank Ltd . 
ITO said the volume of exporters &apos; sales was not huge but that they seemed keen to arrange sales in order to convert overseas earnings into yen at a rate above 120 yen in June and July . 
major Japanese manufacturers have figured their internal operation costs based on an exchange rate of 115-120 yen in the first half of this fiscal year from April , and a steep rise in the yen &apos;s value beyond that level would hurt exporters severely .
