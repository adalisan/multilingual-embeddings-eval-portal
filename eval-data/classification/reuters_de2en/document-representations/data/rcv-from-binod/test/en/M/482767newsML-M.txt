London Metal Exchange ( LME ) base metals prices shuffled sideways in light volumes on Wednesday following an uneventful options declaration . 
zinc briefly hit a fresh 4-1 / 2 year high of $ 1,311 , but that was a mere $ 1 above Tuesday &apos;s high mark and prices rapidly retreated to just above the $ 1,300 level . 
three months copper prices ended the morning kerb marginally easier at $ 2,357 per tonne , compared to $ 2,360 on Tuesday afternoon . 
volumes were slim , possibly due to the short holiday week , and prices were therefore easily pushed around near the $ 2,350 support level , dealers said . 
copper racked up some $ 5 on a small amount of business in the official ring trading . 
&quot; copper is actually quite lethargic and directionless . 
there was some good business in Asia this morning due to the dollar / yen but that &apos;s dried up , &quot; a trader noted . 
&quot; And with New York coming in an hour later this week the market is not getting very excited . 
the options declaration had focussed on the $ 2,400 strike price , which resulted in a partial declaration of calls and puts , dealers said . 
a similarly unimpressive options scenario prevailed in aluminium , where activity had been seen centering on the $ 1,600 strike . 
&quot; It had zero effect on the market , &quot; a dealer said . 
zinc showed some spark early on in the rings , but finished $ 6 weaker at $ 1,303 after the attempt to push higher failed to find follow-through interest . 
on the upside $ 1,325 was the next resistance although zinc is overbought and may need to consolidate before moving higher , dealers said . 
lead was slightly firmer at $ 690 , compared to $ 688 / 89 on Tuesday , but off the day &apos;s high of $ 696 . 
dealers attributed its gains to shortcovering on the back of moderate Far Eastern buying in the pre-market and rings . 
but $ 695 / $ 700 was expected to provide stiff resistance . 
tin was very quiet , ending $ 15 firmer at $ 5,875 . 
but nickel continued edging lower after the morning &apos;s disappointed liquidation and finished the kerb $ 50 lower at $ 7,710 . 
Alloy was $ 10 lower at $ 1,530 .
