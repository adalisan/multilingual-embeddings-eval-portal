Oxfam International , an aid group , said on Thursday that it was an open question whether the new funding approved for Uganda would be sufficient to allow it repay its loans on a sustainable basis . 
&quot; I think there is a question mark about that , &quot; said Oxfam official Justin Forsyth at a press briefing . 
&quot; The proof will be in the eating . 
we &apos;ll see in a few year &apos;s time whether Uganda begins to accumulate debt again . 
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Wednesday said Uganda , the first country to benefit from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries debt initiative , will see its debts cut on April 1998 by $ 338 million , a drop of about 20 percent . 
the point of the initiative was the realization that many poor countries would never get off the treadmill of debt repayment that held back poverty alleviation without reduction in the loan accumulation . 
but Oxfam has been critical of the effort , saying it has become bogged down in the politics of the rich industrial countries , some of which questioned the concept of debt forgiveness while others worried it would slow reforms . 
Oxfam said &quot; high-level horse trading &quot; between powerful industrialized countries was leading to longer than justified delays in assistance for many poor countries under the program .
