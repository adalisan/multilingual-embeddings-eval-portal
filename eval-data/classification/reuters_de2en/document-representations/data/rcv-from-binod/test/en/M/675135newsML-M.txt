the NYMEX electricity complex finally showed signs of fatigue Friday after surging this week on dry heat in the Southwest , unplanned power plant outages and strength in the natural gas market . 
&quot; Cash ( prices ) was much lower and we needed a ( technical ) retracement , &quot; said a Houston futures trader . 
July Palo Verde ( PV ) futures lost $ 1.80 at $ 33.90 a megawatt hour ( MWh ) after posting a session low $ 33.15 . 
July California-Oregon Border ( COB ) settled down 73 cents at $ 21.50 a MWh , near halving an earlier $ 1.48 loss . 
amid forecasts for cooler weather in the West next week , firm , peak power prices for Monday at COB slipped $ 3.00 to $ 16.50-17.50 , while those at PV tumbled $ 7.00 to $ 25.50-27.50 . 
Meterologists forecast temperatures in the Southwest to average one to six degrees F above normal through early next week , with those in the Pacific Northwest two to six degrees below normal over the same period . 
in power generation , Southern California Edison pushed back the restart of the 1,080 megawatt ( MW ) San Onofre 3 nuclear unit in San Clemente , Calif . , to July 10 from late June for additional work . 
also , the 750 MW unit 5 at the Four corners , New Mexico , coal-fired plant may be shut for a week after it tripped off-line Wednesday due to a tube rupture , 
several units which were shut for unexpected maintenance were scheduled to return to service soon , however , including two 750 MW units at the Moss landing natural gas-fired power plant near Monterey , Calif . 
the 1,112 MW WNP-2 nuclear power plant in Washington state was tentatively set to restart next Wednesday or Thursday , pending approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) . 
while most players expect today &apos;s selloff to carry into Monday , they said the tenor of the market remained bullish . 
&quot; Ultimately , we &apos;ll head up higher like last month before expiration , &quot; another Houston futures trader said . 
the July electricity contracts will expire Wednesday .
