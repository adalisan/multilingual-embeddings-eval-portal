Asian debt markets offered something for everyone on Wednesday . 
the action started early with the launch of a US $ 500 million Euro-Asian bond by General Motors Acceptance Corp , a unit of U.S. firm General Motors . 
the 6.75 percent bond due July 2002 was priced at 101.265 and re-offered at 99.69 to yield 40 basis points over the U.S. Treasury five-year when-issued bond . 
the notes have a final maturity of seven years and puts and calls after five years . 
they pay a coupon of 210 basis points over the London Interbank offered Rate and , with fees , an all-in return of 230 basis points to top-tier managers . 
the borrower tapped the markets earlier this year that was extremely well-received . 
the amount was doubled to US $ 60 million and the arrangers , BA Asia and KorAm Bank , reportedly had to give up some of their take to satisfy demand from other banks . 
that three-year deal paid an all-in return of 225 basis points , a spread bankers said was generous . 
the deal launched in January had slighly different covenants than today &apos;s deal . 
the last transaction was secured by a letter of undertaking from China &apos;s Ministry of Construction , which owns 43.4 percent of the issuer via a subsidiary . 
the January transaction also stipulated that the construction ministry would continue to own at least 40 percent of the issuer through a unit throughout the life of the notes . 
the latest deal offers a letter of comfort from the construction ministry and indicates that the ministry must maintain a 33.3 percent stake in the issuer through subsidiary Gold Ram or another unit . 
from Taiwan , Taishin International Bank offered a US $ 60 million floating rate certificate of deposit issue . 
bankers said the bank , which is unrated , is comparable to Baa1-rated E-Sun and Bank Sinopac . 
Taishin is paying 26.83 basis points all-in for three years , compared with E-Sun &apos;s 25 basis points for its recent three-year paper and Sinopac &apos;s 26 basis points for its deal in March . 
in other news , several Indian companies are expected to tap international debt markets for US $ 1.0 billion in funds following a relaxation of government controls on offshore borrowing .
