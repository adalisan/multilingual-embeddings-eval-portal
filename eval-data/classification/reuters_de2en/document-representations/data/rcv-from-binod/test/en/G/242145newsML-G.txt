a south Sudanese militia released on Sunday three Red Cross people held in southern Sudan since their plane landed in the militia &apos;s territory by mistake five weeks ago , the Red Cross said . 
Australian nurse Maree Worthington , American pilot John Early and Kenyan pilot Mohsin Raza flew to Khartoum on Sunday afternoon after intervention on the ground by U.S. 
Congressman Bill Richardson , Democrat of New Mexico , a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) said . 
&quot; According to initial reports , they were well treated ... and are in satisfactory health , &quot; an ICRC statement said . 
the three fell into the hands of the militia led by Commander Kerubino Kwanyin Kol on November 1 when their plane landed at Wunrok in southern Sudan to take home five Sudanese patients discharged from a Red Cross hospital in northern Kenya . 
they had expected the rebel Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) to be in control but instead found Kerubino &apos;s splinter group , which calls itself the SPLA / Bahr el-Ghazal group . 
the town had changed hands in recent fighting . 
the militia , which has signed a peace charter with the government in Khartoum , accused the ICRC of providing assistance to the mainstream SPLA . 
an ICRC statement said that on November 19 Kerubino agreed to release the three within three days . 
&quot; Unfortunately this commitment was not honoured , &quot; it said . 
early &apos;s family called in Congressman Richardson , who visited both Khartoum and the militia-held town of Gogrial , it said . 
&quot; Richardson was in Gogrial today , &quot; the spokesman said . 
the militia is still holding the patients from the plane and the Red Cross said it would do everything possible to ensure they can go back to their families , who live in the area . 
the incident has completely paralysed ICRC operations in Sudan , the statement said . 
&quot; It ( ICRC ) will now have to consider whether the conditions for a resumption of its humanitarian operations in aid of all victims of the conflict can be met , &quot; it added . 
the SPLA has been fighting for autonomy of the mainly Christian and animist south against Khartoum &apos;s Moslem government for 13 years . 
most of the victims have been civilians displaced from their homes or reduced to starvation .
