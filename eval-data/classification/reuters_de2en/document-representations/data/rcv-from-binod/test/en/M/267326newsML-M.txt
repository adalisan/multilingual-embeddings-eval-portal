January and March CME lumber futures closed up the $ 10.00 per thousand board foot daily limit as stronger cash markets and talk of mill closings sparked short covering and stop loss buying , traders said . 
January closed limit up at $ 407.10 per tbf and March limit up at $ 404.90 per tbf . 
other months ended up $ 3.90 to off $ 0.50 with only distant November off . 
reports that cash spruce prices jumped $ 12 per tbf from Wednesday &apos;s quotes to $ 395 , added to support from further talk that mills will extend seasonal down times . 
strong fundamentals added to gains and pushed futures into buy stops , traders said . 
Chartists noted that January gapped higher at the start and left an island on the charts which is considered bullish . 
some traders consider the rally to be overdone and cited weather factors that could slow or stop home construction . 
&quot; It &apos;s really hard to have a lot of lumber demand when it &apos;s 20 below zero and it &apos;s snowing in half the country , &quot; said Neil Schmaedick , Smith Barney Forest Products analyst . 
Schmaedick also noted that mills shut down every year during the holiday . 
&quot; They do it every year , &quot; he said .
