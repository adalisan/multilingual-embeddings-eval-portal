politics crept into market sentiment in Cyprus this week , with equities closing the week 0.73 percent lower and investors waiting on the sidelines for news on the current Cyprus peace talks , analysts said . 
the Cyprus Stock Exchange ( CSE ) index , set at 100 points , closed the week at 75.71 points , from last week &apos;s close of 76.27 . 
&quot; There is a wait and see attitude on the market at the moment , &quot; said Stephanos Hailis of A.L. 
pro Choice stockbrokers , referring to U.N. sponsored talks on the protracted Cyprus dispute which are currently underway between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in New York . 
the talks started on July 9 and end July 13 . 
&quot; The market has not been affected by the talks because there is alot of disbelief there will be progress .... these talks are the most important that have taken place on the Cyprus issue , but there have been talks before and the Cyprus problem has been around for more than 20 years , &quot; Hailis said . 
Hailis said he expected a price rally on the bourse if progress is achieved during the talks , but little effect if the issue remains deadlocked . 
Cisco , the Cyprus Investment and Securities Corporation , said the market was going through a bearish stage , with investors appearing reluctant to make any major investment moves until some clear messages emerge on the outcome of the New York talks .
