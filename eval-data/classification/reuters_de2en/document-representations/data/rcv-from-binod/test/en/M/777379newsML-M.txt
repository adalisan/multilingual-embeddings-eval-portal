SIMEX Nikkei futures pared some of their losses by the close of Monday trade but dealers said the market would have trouble regaining the key 20,000 level against a backdrop of construction and financial sector woes . 
dealers said the September Nikkei should trade between 19,500 and 20,000 in the near term , after remaining well supported at the low end of this range on Monday . 
Nikkei 225 September futures backed off an early high of 19,925 to end at 19,755 , 40 points below their previous close . 
dealers said the market lacked conviction on the upside after falling through the resilient 19,950 technical support on Friday . 
&quot; I believe the 19,500 support should hold now unless there &apos;s worse news from the finance houses . 
this will just put people on the sidelines , &quot; a trader at a local institution said . 
Taiwan stock index futures ended easier on mild profit-taking but dealers said sentiment remained bullish . 
the August MSCI contract shed 1.3 points to close at 423.8 on volume of 1,816 lots . 
Refco Singapore PTE Ltd said overall volume was slightly disappointing as Taiwan retail interest was still not aggressive after Taiwan authorities lifted a ban on local trading of the offshore futures from August 1 .
