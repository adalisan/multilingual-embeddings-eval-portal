Portuguese international Luis Figo has signed a new contract with Barcelona that will keep him at the club until 2002 . 
Figo , who had been linked with Italy &apos;s AC Milan , will earn an estimated 250 million pesetas ( $ 1.72 million ) a year . 
a clause in the new contract sets at five billion pesetas ( $ 34.5 million ) the price to be paid by a club wanting to buy the winger . 
meanwhile , French striker Christophe Dugarry was optimistic about his chances of joining Barcelona . 
in an interview published by the sports daily &apos; El Mundo Deportivo &apos; on Friday , Dugarry said : &quot; It &apos;s true , Barcelona and I are in agreement , and those a four-year deal is what we &apos;re both looking for , &quot; 
but he added there was still a &apos; question mark &apos; over his move from AC Milan . 
&quot; Only the signature is missing . 
I know it &apos;s only a formality , but the experience of other cases leads me to ( say this ) &quot; . 
another striker from the Italian league , fiorentina &apos;s Gabriel Batistuta , has also been widely linked with Barcelona by the Spanish media over the past few days . 
the reports suggest the Argentine will not stay at fiorentina and could go to Inter Milan if Inter fail to buy Barcelona &apos;s Brazilian prodigy Ronaldo . 
the possible loss of Ronaldo seems to have stung Barcelona into action . 
within the next few days the club are expected to renegotiate the contracts of several other key players , among them midfielders Josep Guardiola and Ivan de la Pena .
