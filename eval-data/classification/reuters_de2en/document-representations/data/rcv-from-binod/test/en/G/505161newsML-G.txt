lance Klusener produced a memorable all-round performance to help South Africa to a crushing 109-run victory over Australia in the seventh and final one-day international in Bloemfontein on Sunday . 
Klusener followed up a career best 92 as a pinch-hitting opener with the first two wickets of the Australian reply and a stunning catch on the boundary to remove the dangerous Michael Bevan . 
Steve Waugh , who took over the captaincy for the day , hit a brilliant 91 in 79 balls but that was the only sustained resistance as Australia wilted under the pressure of chasing South Africa &apos;s mammoth 310 for six . 
however , with the one-day series clinched 4-2 at centurion Park on Thursday , on top of a 2-1 victory in the test series , Australia had already achieved their twin objectives for the tour and chose to rest key players Ian Healy and Jason Gillespie . 
faced with an asking rate of 6.2 per over Australia got off to the worst possible start when Michael Di Venuto cut Klusener on to his stumps in the fourth over . 
one run later Mark Waugh was caught behind for three off the same Bowler and pinch-hitter Brendon Julian was bowled by Shaun pollock for nought to make it 18 for three . 
Michael Bevan ( 29 in 28 balls ) briefly threatened a repeat of the record 189-run partnership he shared with Steve Waugh to help his side overhaul South Africa &apos;s 284 at centurion Park on Thursday . 
but his innings ended when Klusener sprinted around the long-on boundary before diving to his right to pick off a lofted drive a metre inside the boundary . 
earlier , Klusener had laid the foundations for South Africa &apos;s total with a 115-ball innings to eclipse his previous highest one-day total of 88 , also against Australia , in India earlier this season . 
Hansie Cronje then crashed 69 in 65 balls , with three sixes , and Daryll Cullinan improvised an undefeated 57 from 39 balls . 
with Adam Dale &apos;s last over costing 19 runs , South Africa sailed past the 300 mark after plundering 83 off the final 10 overs . 
Klusener was named man of the match with Shaun pollock picking up the man of the series award for his 152 runs at better than a run a ball in four completed innings to go with his 12 wickets .
