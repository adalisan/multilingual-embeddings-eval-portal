reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) governor Bernie Fraser said on Thursday he agreed with the government &apos;s forecasts for economic growth but thought inflation could be lower . 
Fraser said also in a submission to a parliamentary committee that the effects of the last reduction in interest rates on July 31 would only become apparent in the months ahead . 
&quot; The budget forecast for 1996 / 97 envisage a sixth year of growth of around 3.5 percent , with inflation of about 2.75 percent , &quot; Fraser said . 
&quot; We agree generally with these forecasts , but we think inflation through 1996 / 97 could turn out to be a little lower , &quot; he said . 
the budget forecast the consumer price index ( CPI ) to rise 2.0 percent in year average terms in the year to June 30 , 1997 and for underlying inflation to rise 2.75 percent . 
&quot; The growth foreasts are underpinned by a reasonably encouraging outlook for our major trading partners , good levels of business and consumer confidence and the absence of any major &apos; imbalances &apos; in the domestic economy , &quot; Fraser said . 
he said the further 14 percent rise expected in business investment in 1996 / 97 is an important key to achieving the growth forecast . 
Fraser repeated that the bank was confident inflation in the Setpember quarter would be comfortably within the two to three percent target range , and that it would remain there over the year ahead .
