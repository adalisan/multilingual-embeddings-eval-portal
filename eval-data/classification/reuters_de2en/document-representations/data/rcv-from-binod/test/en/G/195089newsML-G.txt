Australia stretched their unbeaten run on their current tour to eight games by defeating Ulster 39-26 at Ravenhill on Saturday . 
the visitors took control of the game early in the second-half after a period of sustained forward pressure was rewarded with a penalty try in the 48th minute . 
winger David Campese went over in the right corner a minute later and with full-back Matthew Burke converting both tries the Australians had turned a four point half-time deficit into a 10-point lead by the 49th minute . 
Ulster fly-off Stuart Laing and Burke swapped penalties before winger Joseph Roff went over for his second fine try in the 69th minute to push Australia 36-19 in front . 
the home side were awarded a penalty try of their own in the 77th minute before Australian fly-half David Knox completed the scoring with a penalty . 
the visitors made an ominous start in the fifth minute when lock forward and captain John Eales burst over for a try , but Ulster fought back through two penalties from Laing and a try by right winger James topping , which Laing converted , to push Ulster 13-5 ahead after 22 minutes . 
they led 16-12 at half-time but the Wallabies , who face Ireland at Lansdowne Road next weekend , ensured their fast start to the second-half was not wasted .
