United Nations chief Kofi Annan and his wife Nane departed from their official schedule on Wednesday to attend a private dinner at the home of U.S. 
Congressman Tom Lantos in which history came full circle . 
Lantos , a California Democrat , and his wife Annette , were rescued from near-certain death in Hungary by Raoul Wallenberg , the legendary Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Jews from Nazi destruction near the end of the Second World War . 
Nane Annan , a Swedish artist and lawyer , is the niece of Wallenberg . 
she was born shortly before he disappeared in 1945 , presumably into a Soviet prison , at the age of 32 . 
her mother , Nina Lagergren , as well as other members of the family have worked for decades to find out news about him and keep alive the memory of what he accomplished . 
Lantos has sought to repay his debt to Wallenberg , speaking about him all over the world and having a bust of him erected in the U.S. Capitol building . 
he used Annan &apos;s three-day official visit to Washington -- the U.N. chief &apos;s first foray out of New York since he took office as secretary-general on Jan . 1 -- to entertain the couple at a small dinner , without their aides . 
Nane Annan , who remembers Wallenberg as a &quot; constant presence , an absence , a shadow , &quot; said she first met Annette Lantos in Stockholm in 1979 at a Wallenberg commemoration . 
the Lantos &apos; were introduced to Kofi Annan , a Ghanaian who now heads a world organisation founded on the ashes of the Second World War , 10 years ago at another Wallenberg commemoration . 
during most of Nane Annan &apos;s early life , her mother and late grandparents sought information about Wallenberg . 
&quot; I remember my grandmother , especially , on the telephone endlessly , &quot; she said . 
with little regard for his own safety , Wallenberg saved tens of thousands of Jews from Nazi death camps during 1944 by issuing them with Swedish passports and verbally threatening Nazi generals . 
he was arrested on Jan . 17 , 1945 by Soviet soldiers and his fate remains unknown , although some reports presume he died in 1947 after refusing to work as a spy for Moscow . 
but Nane Annan said her family would never stop searching until they found absolute proof of his fate . 
Tom and Annette Lantos , who knew each other as children in Budapest , survived with Wallenberg &apos;s help . 
Lantos , 16 at the time , acted as a messenger for Wallenberg , running back and forth from safe houses .
