China will avoid bold moves in tackling its ailing state enterprises as it focuses on stability ahead of this year &apos;s crucial Communist Party congress , analysts said on Monday . 
they said policy makers would err on the side of caution in a year billed by Beijing as one of the most significant of the communist era . 
&quot; Reform of state enterprises is the nation &apos;s biggest economic problem but it is an extremely difficult one to solve , &quot; said economist Cheng Xiusheng of the Development Research Centre of the State Council , or cabinet . 
as China sheds the vestiges of a centrally planned economy , it wants state-owned companies , which have grown fat under government nurturing , to be leaner and better able to compete in the marketplace . 
about 75 percent of state firms are losing money . 
losses surged to about 69 billion yuan ( $ 8.3 billion ) in the first 10 months of last year , a rise of 45 percent over the same period of 1995 , officials have said . 
halting those losses would mean shedding much of the workforce and in some cases making use of bankruptcy laws to dissolve companies . 
China &apos;s rulers have vowed to push ahead with reforms of the state sector but analysts are betting that the scale of any changes will be limited . 
analysts note that China has set a target of keeping urban unemployment around three percent this year , little changed from the official figure issued in the recent past . 
&quot; The problem is there is no social safety net , &quot; said a Western diplomat . 
China has no real unemployment insurance system and retirement schemes cover only a fraction of the working public . 
as most social welfare benefits stem from the employer , the loss of a job could have a huge impact on the individual . 
on a wider scale it could mean social unrest . 
&quot; The Chinese realise where the problem lies , &quot; said the diplomat . 
&quot; The trick is being able to make tough political decisions . 
that is unlikely this year as China &apos;s leaders prepare for the party congress that will set policies over the medium term . 
&quot; No one wants to go into that meeting with the threat of social unrest , &quot; said another diplomat . 
Beijing is also loath to take risks as it awaits the recovery of Hong Kong on July 1 after more than 150 years of British rule . 
it wants a smooth handover . 
some economists had hoped communist leaders would turn their attention to the deep-rooted problems of the state sector this year after Beijing effectively declared victory in its other major campaign -- the battle against inflation . 
China wrestled inflation down to six percent last year from 14.8 percent in 1995 and a Communist-era high of more than 21 percent in 1994 , according to official data . 
economic leaders were confident enough inflation had been licked to allow state-set prices for postal rates and local telephone calls -- long held at subsidised levels -- to rise sharply last month . 
but economists said that this year at least , Beijing would prefer to continue with some of its subsidies rather than pay the social cost of putting ailing companies out of business .
