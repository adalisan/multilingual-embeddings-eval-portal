Argentina ended 1996 with annual consumer price inflation of 0.054 percent , after prices fell 0.3 percent in December versus the previous month , the Economy Ministry announced Friday . 
that compares to annual inflation of 1.6 percent in 1995 and to a monthly rise of 0.1 percent in December that year . 
analysts had forecast a rise in consumer prices for December 1996 of 0.1 percent . 
wholesale prices ended the year with a 2.1 percent annual rise , after December showed a 0.1 percent fall on the previous month compared to a 0.8 percent drop in November and a 0.2 percent rise in December 1995 . 
the tiny consumer price rise for the year means Argentina registered its smallest rise in the cost of living for the last 51 years . 
records show that the cost of living fell 0.3 percent in 1944 . 
it also means consumer price inflation has been dropping for seven consecutive years . 
the current levels are in very sharp contrast to the hyperinflation of 4,923 percent seen in 1989 and 1,343 percent registered in 1990 . 
the government had forecast that 1996 would end with annual inflation at 0.1 percent . 
President Carlos Menem recently predicted inflation would be 0.0 percent in 1997 . 
after former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo pegged the peso to the dollar under his convertibility Plan for economic stability in 1991 , inflation was slashed that year to 84 percent .
