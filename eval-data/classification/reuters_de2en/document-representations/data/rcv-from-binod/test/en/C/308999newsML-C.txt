the debate over whether California &apos;s electricity distribution services should be opened to competition along with power generation has begun to heat up as state regulators review the issue . 
on Wednesday , the California Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC ) held an evidentiary hearing on such &quot; unbundling &quot; , or separation , of billing and metering costs . 
under legislation passed last year , a cross-section of California consumers will be able to chose an electricity supplier from January 1998 , with all buyers phased in by 2001 . 
but power transmission and distribution rates , along with nuclear and must-run generation units , would still be regulated . 
the CPUC may also allow open competition for distribution services , such as metering and billing , which have been part of utilities &apos; traditional monopoly franchise . 
&quot; Selective unbundling would deny ( Edison ) a level playing field , foster cost shifting among categories of customers , impede the transition to direct access , and jeopardize the integrity of the metering and billing process , &quot; Edison said in a statement . 
PG &amp; E chairman Stanley Skinner said in a recent Reuters interview that the power distribution business was an attractive one , similar to the San Francisco-based utility &apos;s post-deregulation role in the retail natural gas market . 
but Enova Corp &apos;s San Diego Gas and Electric Co ( SDG &amp; E ) , along with Pacific Enterprises , parent of Southern California Gas Co , favor unbundling distribution services . 
SDG &amp; E said competition for metering and billing will result in a wider range of products and services for customers as well as new technologies that will improve service and lower costs . 
Enova and PET , which share nearly contiguous southern California service territories , announced in October plans to merge , forming a combined gas / electric utility with more customers than any other in the U.S. 
the merger is being reviewed by the CPUC , and also must be approved by various federal agencies . 
analysts said the merged utility would present the biggest competitive threat to SoCal Edison , most of whose customers now also receive bills from SoCal Gas . 
most other stakeholders in the debate over distribution services , such as consumer groups and local governments , also favor allowing competition for distribution services . 
but the California Small Business Administration ( CSBA ) , which has been actively supported by Edison , said it fears unbundling would raise reliability and accountability problems . 
Edison , which has sponsored a series of small business and entrepreneur development seminars and programs , said Tuesday its efforts to retain and expand existing regional small businesses saved more than 30,000 jobs last year . 
CSBA president Betty Jo Toccoli said Wednesday the group opposes immediate unbundling of metering and billing functions and is &quot; seriously concerned that new , out-of-state power marketers are encouraging the CPUC to consider the unbundling of distribution services without any kind of legislative or public call to action . 
in addition to unbundling of distribution services , the CPUC proceeding is expected to include topics such as whether metering should be standardized . 
the CPUC is expected to release its decision on the issue sometime in mid-February .
