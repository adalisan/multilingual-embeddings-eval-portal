the Czech PX50 ended a turbulant week in which the government narrowly won a parliamentary confidence vote with a small gain led by the most heavily capitalised banking issue Komercni Banka . 
Komercni closed up 47 crowns to 2,030 after posting sharp falls in recent sessions . 
the construction sector , which was hit hard by a poor first quarter , continued to move in uncertain fashion . 
IPS Praha was unchanged on 205 , Metrostav rose seven crowns to 2,097 and Stavby Silnic a Zeleznic lost three crowns to 944 . 
&quot; We &apos;re a bit concerned about the debt position of many construction firms which is difficult because they use a lot of short term debt to cover delays in payments , &quot; said Lindsay Ashford of Zivnostneska Banka . 
companies reliant on short term financing have been hard hit in recent weeks by extraordinarly high interest rates caused by central bank measures to secure the Czech crown . 
Ashford said that this made investments in most construction firms risky at the moment .
