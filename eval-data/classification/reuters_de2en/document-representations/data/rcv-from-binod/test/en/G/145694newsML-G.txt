Chechen separatist leaders said on Saturday they would not agree to any Russian military presence in Chechnya , Interfax news agency said , heralding further complications in the search for peace in the region . 
Interfax quoted chief rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov as saying that the separatist leadership opposed Moscow &apos;s plans to keep two brigades permanently in Chechnya . 
&quot; This issue has been raised by forces interested in continuing war in Chechnya , &quot; Udugov said , adding that the August 31 peace deal the rebels signed with then top Russian negotiator Alexander Lebed contained no such provision . 
Lebed has since been sacked by President Boris Yeltsin . 
Russia sent troops into Chechnya in December 1994 to quell the region &apos;s independence bid , and the subsequent war has cost tens of thousands of lives . 
under the Lebed deal Moscow agreed to withdraw its troops in exchange for the five-year postponement of a decision on Chechnya &apos;s future political status -- the central issue of the conflict . 
the rebels , who saw the peace deal as a face-saving way for Moscow to let Chechnya go , insist that all Russian troops should leave . 
Russia , which has ruled out Chechen independence , is currently running down its forces in the region , but insisted recently that two brigades must remain permanently stationed there . 
discord over the Russian military presence seems likely to strike a further blow at peace talks between Moscow and rebels . 
separatist leaders have voiced concern that Yeltsin &apos;s decision earlier this month to sack Lebed , the author of the deal , could reinforce the &quot; party of war &quot; in Moscow and undermine the peace process in Chechnya . 
Moscow &apos;s new negotiator , Ivan Rybkin , has said Moscow would stick to the peace deal but he has acknowledged differences in understanding key parts of the accord . 
Rybkin was expected to visit Chechnya in the next few days to hold talks with rebel leaders .
