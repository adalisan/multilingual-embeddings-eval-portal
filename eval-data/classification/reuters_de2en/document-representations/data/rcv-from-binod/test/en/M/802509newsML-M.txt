the week of a Federal Open Market Committee meeting used to stir much excitement and nervousness in the U.S. Treasury market . 
not anymore . 
virtually everyone expects no policy change on Tuesday . 
&quot; When the Fed is ready to tighten again they will tell the market loud and clear much like prior to the March tightening , &quot; said Joseph Liro , chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Corp. 
this time &quot; they have gone out of their way to assure the market they are not moving . 
even so , traders said the meeting will generate interest and perhaps be followed with a relief rally . 
&quot; The market can do a little better here , &quot; said Bill Kirby , co-head trader at prudential Securities Inc . &quot; But not to ( the high ) levels where we were at anytime soon . 
the benchmark 30-year bond , which closed at a 6.57 percent yield on Friday , was predicted to remain in a 6.40 percent to 6.70 percent range for the next two weeks -- until more key data signal a clearer picture of the economic backdrop . 
&quot; Things thinned out ( this ) last week and it will get thinner as we approach Labor day , &quot; said Liro . 
the problem for the market given the thin environment is that violent price swings are common . 
&quot; We get these vicious moves and they don &apos;t mean very much . 
large intraday moves have proved the norm in recent sessions . 
for instance , bonds rallied 1-1 / 4 points on Wednesday morning , only to give back just about all of those gains . 
and Friday , bonds rose modestly after being down one full point late in the afternoon . 
in the upcoming week , players said , economic growth takes center stage . 
&quot; We got this ( past ) week with inflation not a problem , &quot; Kirby said . 
&quot; The market is now trying to figure out what happens with growth . 
economic data due this week include July housing starts on Tuesday , June international trade on Wednesday and the Philadelphia Fed &apos;s August business outlook survey on Thursday . 
supply also becomes an issue , as the Treasury will announce details on Wednesday of the following week &apos;s two- and five-year note auction . 
earlier in the month heavy supply was a prime reason for the market falling from 1-1 / 2 year highs . 
also , both the stock and foreign exchange markets will be a key focus for the market . 
late this week , a fall in the dollar weighed on the market at the long end , although a so-called flight-to-quality from stocks into treasuries helped the front end -- mainly bills . 
many players expect that trend to continue , which will add to the steepening of the yield curve . 
the spread between the two-year note and 30-year bond widened to 74 basis points on Friday from 68 basis points on Thursday and 57 basis points just a week ago .
