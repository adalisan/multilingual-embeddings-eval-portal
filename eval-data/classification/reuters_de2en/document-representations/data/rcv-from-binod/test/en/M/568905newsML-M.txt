Toronto stocks ended higher on Thursday on the back of stronger bank and gold issues , resuming its upward march after two days of weakness . 
the Toronto Stock Exchange key 300 composite Index jumped 35.92 points to close at 6157.44 . 
&quot; The momentum is there and at this stage I have no doubt that Toronto will break new highs &quot; this month , said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels . 
wall Street rallied on the prospect of a proposed capital gains tax cut . 
but the markets peaked in late afternoon , surging 1.5 percent in New York and one percent in Toronto before the enthusiasm subsided and they gave back some of their gains . 
&quot; Toronto mimics New York , with a bit of delay , &quot; Meisels said . 
eight of Toronto &apos;s 14 sub-indices rose . 
the stronger side was led by golds , base metals , conglomerates and banks , while decliners included media , transportation and consumer products . 
advances led declines 599 to 362 , while 301 traded flat . 
in individual issues , Bank of Montreal rose 0.60 to 52.10 in active dealings . 
waste management Philip Environmental Inc. topped Toronto &apos;s net losers , dropping 3.80 to 17.80 after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts &apos; expectations . 
Tee-Comm electronics Inc. lost more than half its value , plunging 1.20 to 0.85 after a liquidity crunch this week that put the satellite television provider &apos;s future in doubt .
