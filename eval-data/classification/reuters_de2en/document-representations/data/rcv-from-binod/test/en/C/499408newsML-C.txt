these figures are not prepared to international accounting standards but to Russian accounting standards , which differ significantly from those normally supplied in the West . 
Russian accounts are designed to meet the requirements of the tax authorities . 
definitions of profit and assets differ significantly from those in the West , and converting Russian accounts to international standards can turn a profit into a loss .
