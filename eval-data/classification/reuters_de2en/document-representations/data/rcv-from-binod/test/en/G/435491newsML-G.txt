Dutchman Bryan Roy looks set to be shown the door at Nottingham Forest this summer following a public clash with Dave Bassett and Wednesday &apos;s arrival of one-million-pound striker Ian Moore from Tranmere . 
forest &apos;s new general manager Bassett was considering whether to fine the Dutch international for his show of dissent during the 1-1 draw at Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday , at the same time as tying up the loose ends on 20-year-old Moore &apos;s transfer from Tranmere . 
Bassett was furious at the way Roy disputed the decision to substitute him at Ewood Park and the gesture of disgust the player made towards first team coach Liam O &apos;Kane . 
Bassett said : &quot; I &apos;m not prepared to tolerate that kind of behaviour from anyone and he &apos;s looking at a possible fine . 
what he did is being derogatory to his team mates and to the coaching staff and to me . 
&quot; He seems to think he &apos;s bigger than the team . 
this is a team game and players , especially one of his calibre , should be professional enough to deal with it . 
if he &apos;s substituted then that is it and he should accept it , not make public gestures like that and question people &apos;s authority . 
&quot; Bryan feels he is being made a scapegoat for the situation we &apos;re in . 
it is the second time in less than a week that Roy has been involved in public dissent with club officials . 
last Wednesday he clashed with player-manager Stuart Pearce in the 3-0 defeat by Sheffield Wednesday . 
with the signing of Pierre Van Hooydonk and the arrival of England under-21 striker Moore , Roy &apos;s days at the City Ground seem to be numbered . 
his contract runs out next season and Forest could be ready to allow him to return to the Netherlands for a cut-price fee .
