the mark rebounded from six-and-a-half-month lows against the Swiss franc after the Swiss National Bank said the recent surge in the franc was unwarranted by economic fundamentals and added liquidity to the money markets . 
the SNB said it will continue to add liquidity to counter any &quot; unrealistic appreciation &quot; of the franc . 
&quot; There had been some big flows into Swiss francs after the recent volatility and the SNB coming out and saying they didn &apos;t want it , and adding liquidity caught a lot of people out , &quot; said Craig Justham , the deputy manager of foreign exchange at Creditanstalt Bankverein in London . 
the mark had fallen as much as three percent against the Swiss franc in the past week , setting a low of 82.39 centimes overnight , its weakest since October 24 . 
it rebounded one percent after the SNB remarks , last trading at 83.09 / 12 centimes , from 82.97 / 99 late Tuesday in Europe . 
with Switzerland &apos;s nascent Swiss economic recovery yet to gather momentum , the authorities will be keen to keep the franc from strengthening in order to foster export growth . 
the Swiss Institute for Business Cycle Research said last week that broad economic growth was not expected before the third quarter . 
with trading in the dollar likely to remain volatile and vulnerable to setbacks , the SNB will likely be forced to back up its words with further action in the week ahead , traders said . 
&quot; They don &apos;t want the Swiss ( franc ) to be strong , but the dollar still tends to look offered on any rallies so there will tend to be flows into safe havens , &quot; said Justham at Creditanstalt Bankverein . 
the mark was little changed against most other European currencies . 
trading in the Italian lira was expected to take its cue from the second batch of Italian cities &apos; consumer price data which will be released later today . 
data from four Italian cities released yesterday reinforced expectations that Italy &apos;s inflation rate will fall to 1.5 percent in May from 1.7 percent in April . 
this is seen paving the way for a cut in the Bank of Italy &apos;s discount rate from its current 6.75 percent . 
these hopes have boosted Italian bonds , pushing the spread between benchmark 10-year Italian bonds and German bunds to record lows yesterday , and generating demand for lire . 
the mark was last at 984.70 / 5.00 lire from 983.80 / 984.30 late Tuesday . 
&quot; There &apos;s a good chance of a rate cut tonight after all the CPI numbers come out , &quot; said a trader at Banca Populare di Milano in London . 
&quot; The only reason there &apos;s any doubt is because they may want to keep an eye on the French elections . 
&quot; There was speculation the Bank of Italy will want to see whether the French parliamentary elections , the first round of which will be held Sunday , trigger any currency turmoil before it cuts rates . 
dealers said there was little impact from comments from Bundesbank member Hans-Juergen Koebnick who said earlier a punctual EMU start would take precedence over exact adherence to the entry criteria . 
but Koebnick sees a start with a core of six to eight countries with the need for sustainability leading to differentiation between how Italy , Spain and Portugal are judged .
