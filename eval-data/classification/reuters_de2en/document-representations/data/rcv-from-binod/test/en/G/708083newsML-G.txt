Germany and Russia on Friday hailed the dramatic improvement in their bilateral ties since the end of the Cold War , but admitted differences remained over NATO enlargement . 
the recent creation of formal links between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and Moscow had &quot; opened a new chapter in the history of relations between Russia and the West &quot; , Chancellor Helmut Kohl said during a visit by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . 
giving a speech just a few hundred metres from where the Berlin Wall once stood , Kohl said both sides had learned from their bitter history of war and occupation this century and in just a few years built relations up to be &quot; the best ever &quot; . 
&quot; We now have the chance to create a comprehensive and peaceful order in Europe with Russia as a close partner and , for Germany , a good friend , &quot; Kohl told an audience of business leaders , academics and politicians . 
Chernomyrdin , on a two-day working visit , gave assurances that Moscow &apos;s political and economic reform drive was irreversible and that Russia wanted to raise its profile in world affairs . 
&quot; We are fully determined to move towards integration with democratic states -- we have abandoned confrontation , &quot; he said . 
but the 59-year-old Russian premier , who lost a brother in 1945 in the battle for Berlin , struck a different note over NATO &apos;s plans to admit former Warsaw Pact states . 
a summit of the alliance &apos;s 16 members next week in Madrid is expected to open the way for Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary to begin entry talks . 
&quot; We still think the enlargement of NATO creates more problems than it solves , &quot; Chernomyrdin said . 
he stopped short , however , of saying Moscow would bar the former-Soviet Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania from joining NATO eventually . 
we are not against NATO -- but against the military part of NATO , &quot; he said in response to a question at a later news conference . 
&quot; We do not want to forbid anyone -- that is our principle . 
any state should be able to make its own decision . 
but today there is no need to rush . 
Kohl said there were differences over NATO with Moscow , but said he saw no chance of the issue endangering broader ties . 
he also urged German business to step up its involvement in Russia now reforms were taking hold , and said more could be done to boost trade -- which rose 12 percent to 27 billion marks ( $ 15.4 billion ) last year . 
Germany is Russia &apos;s largest foreign investor . 
Chernomyrdin noted that bilateral trade was still far short of the yearly 46 billion marks achieved before the breakup of the Soviet Union . 
he called for Russia to gain entry to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) soon , saying trade barriers condemned Russia to exporting mainly low-value raw materials . 
he also pressed for a cut in Russia &apos;s risk rating for German export credits . 
Kohl said it might be possible for Russia to extend its partnership agreement with the European Union to eventually create an east-west free trade zone . 
&quot; It may seem a distant goal . 
but then if you look at the last 10 years , then why not ? 
&quot; Kohl said .
