the Sri Lankan rupee ended at an all-time low of 56.80 to the dollar on Monday as commercial demand combined with speculation , dealers said . 
this compares with the previous record close of 56.60 vs the dollar on Friday , and the previous low of 56.45 set on September 19 . 
dealers said the slump was due to import covering demand coming on top of speculators covering positions and banks hanging on to dollars . 
&quot; Supply of dollars became very tight when import covering surfaced at mid-day , and banks did not want to sell dollars because the currency is strong overseas , &quot; said a Bank of Ceylon dealer . 
&quot; On top of this , speculators who sold last week are also rebuilding positions , &quot; he said . 
overnight call money closed stable at its opening level of 15.25 percent due to a big state lender being in the market , dealers said .
