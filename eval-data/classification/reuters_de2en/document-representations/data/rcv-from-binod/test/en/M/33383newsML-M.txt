Tokyo markets were jarred initially on Wednesday when the United States launched missiles against Iraq for a second day , but stocks ended unchanged and the dollar was steady after the shock of the attack wore off . 
&quot; Since the Iraqi-U.S. row has been confined to a specific place with no signs of its extending to others , people in the market are optimistic about it , &quot; said a foreign exchange dealer at a British bank in Tokyo . 
the dollar steadied against the yen and the mark in directionless late-afternoon Tokyo trade . 
traders said the market was largely unfazed by the new missile strikes , which Washington said were aimed at military targets in southern Iraq not destroyed by 27 missiles fired on Tuesday . 
having risen against the yen after Tuesday &apos;s attack , the dollar showed little reaction in Tokyo , refusing to stray far from around 109 yen . 
it stood at 108.95 in late Tokyo trade . 
Tokyo stock prices closed mixed , with the key Nikkei 225 index edging up 3.72 points to 20,201.87 . 
brokers said the impact of the second attack was marginal , although the news initially jolted the market , pulling down the Nikkei to near a key level of 20,000 in the morning . 
&quot; Japan is far away from the region , so it is unlikely to feel a direct impact from the incident . 
as a trading factor , it is rather small , &quot; said Hisao Suzuki , deputy general manager at Yamaichi Securities . 
crude oil futures prices in Asia jumped 30 cents to $ 23.65 a barrel in the minutes after the initial report of the second missile attack . 
but they later eased to $ 23.37 as the market awaited further news from Washington and the United Nations . 
analysts said markets were surprised by the strikes as they had considered Tuesday &apos;s attack a one-off incident . 
&quot; Wall Street as well as Tokyo thought that the fiasco was over , just part of President ( Bill ) Clinton &apos;s election campaign , and anxiety was fading when the second round came , &quot; said Keiji Arai , a strategist at Sanyo Securities . 
analysts said markets would need time to assess the impact of what the Pentagon called a &quot; mop-up operation &quot; . 
&quot; We don &apos;t see the typical &apos; dollar buying in a crisis &apos; because it isn &apos;t a crisis , &quot; Koji Asano , a senior manager at Fuji Bank . 
however , Tsutomu Toichi , head researcher at a Japanese energy think tank , told Reuters on Wednesday that benchmark crude prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) could shoot up as high as $ 25 per barrel in the coming winter if the situation in the Middle East worsened . 
&quot; If the tension increases ... prices would be ... $ 24 or $ 25 for some period , &quot; said Toichi , general manager of the research department at the Institute of Energy Economics . 
if the situation eased , NYMEX crude futures prices would be in a range of between $ 21 and $ 22 per barrel , Toichi predicted . 
he said the impact of higher crude oil prices on Japan &apos;s overall economy would be limited . 
&quot; The current import bill of oil in Japan is about 15 percent of the total import bill . 
so if the oil price increased 10 percent , then the impact would be just 1.5 percent . 
meanwhile , in the Japanese government bond market , the key December bond futures contract ended up after briefly entering negative territory . 
&quot; Most traders ignored the news of a second U.S. attack on Iraq , but some tested the December &apos;s downside , placing some speculative sell orders only to get their fingers burned later , &quot; said a trader at a city bank . 
the December contract ended at 120.70 , up from Tuesday &apos;s 120.49 . 
it moved in a range of 120.45-120.73 in turnover of 53,634 contracts .
