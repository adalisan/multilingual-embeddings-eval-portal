former Portuguese international winger Paulo Futre announced on Tuesday that he was retiring from soccer at the age of 30 because of a recurring knee problem . 
the West Ham player was capped 40 times by his country . 
he began his career at Sporting before moving to Porto where he helped the club to the European Cup in 1987 . 
he also played for Atletico Madrid , Benfica , Marseille , Reggiana and AC Milan before moving to London . 
West Ham manager Harry Redknapp said he was bitterly disappointed to lose a player he ranked amongst the &quot; top six or seven &quot; in the world . 
&quot; It &apos;s a sad blow to lose him , but I am not surprised . 
he has been a fantastic player , absolutely world-class , &quot; he said . 
he had a knee injury , but I wanted to see if he could get himself fit to play in the premier league . 
&quot; He had several outstanding games for us and turned one or two when he came on as sub . 
but he found training and playing on a regular basis difficult . 
&quot; His ability , pace and dribbling skills -- he was second to none . 
he was some player .
