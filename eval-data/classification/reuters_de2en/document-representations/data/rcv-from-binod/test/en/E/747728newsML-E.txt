a figure for the index of leading economic indicators above the so-called &quot; boom-or-bust &quot; 50 mark is generally taken as suggesting the economy will expand in the coming months . 
a figure for the leading index below 50 suggests the economy will contract in the coming months . 
the coincident index measures current economic conditions , while the lagging index traces economic trends in the past few months .
