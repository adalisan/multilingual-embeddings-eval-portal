short-term interbank rates rose further on Monday on twin fears of a fresh rate hike in the U.S. and further tightening in the domestic money market , dealers said on Monday . 
one-week money was quoted at 7.40 / 50 percent against 7.15 / 25 on Friday , two-week at 7.35 / 40 percent against 7.20 / 30 and three-week at 7.30 / 35 percent against 7.25 / 30 . 
one-month money was at 7.35 percent against 7.30 / 33 , three-month at 7.35 / 40 against 7.30 / 35 and six-month at 7.40 / 45 against 7.35 / 38 . 
the dealers said inflation data released in the U.S. on Friday suggested a strong possibility of a follow up to the 25-basis point hike in U.S. lending rates last month , which could trigger a similar trend in Malaysia . 
&quot; In such a scenario Malaysia could either allow rates to go up or allow the gap between U.S. and Malaysian rates to narrow , &quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank . 
dealers were divided over the possible trend . 
but they agreed that if there was a flow of funds out of Malaysia , interest rates could be pushed up . 
&quot; coupled with the possible tightening after Wednesday &apos;s Bank Negara bill issues , people have begun taking slightly long-term positions , &quot; a dealer with another Malaysian bank said . 
on Wednesday , there were two issues of Bank Negara bills totalling one billion ringgit against a maturity of just 500 million ringgit . 
last week , Bank Negara &apos;s intervention in the foreign exchange market , where it is said to have sold nearly $ 200 million , and a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bill issue took out some liquidity from a flush market . 
almost confirming the trend , interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange ( Mme ) fell across the board . 
spot month June contract based on the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank offered Rate ( KLIBOR ) fell one point to 92.69 by 0430 GMT , or an implied yield of 7.31 percent . 
September was down one point to 92.68 , or 7.32 percent and December eased two points to 92.63 , or 7.37 percent .
