Nepal &apos;s Kathmandu valley was rocked by two earthquakes and several tremors early on Saturday but there were no reports of casualties , officials said . 
the tremors woke many residents during Friday night and created a minor panic in the mountainous capital of the Himalayan kingdom . 
officials said a first tremor at 11 p.m. ( 1715 GMT ) was followed by a second , stronger earthquake measuring 5.8 on the open-ended Richter scale at 1.47 a.m. ( 2002 GMT ) . 
&quot; So far we have not received any reports of casualties , &quot; a Home ( interior ) Ministry spokesman said . 
the officials said the epicentre was in Rasuwa district , northeast of Kathmandu . 
they said at least three aftershocks with intensities between 4.3 and 4.7 were felt in the capital . 
&quot; We felt the tremor when we were fast asleep , &quot; Kathmandu resident Sunil Sharma said . 
&quot; I rushed to call my parents who were sleeping on the upper floor and we ran out of the house . 
officials at the National Seismological Centre described the first earthquake as a &quot; pre-shock &quot; measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale and described the later shock as the main earthquake . 
&quot; It was not a large earthquake but a medium-sized one , &quot; Ramlochan Prasad Tandukar , the chief geologist at the centre , told Reuters . 
residents of Rasuwa said by telephone they felt tremors until late morning on Saturday . 
&quot; Houses have developed cracks and some could collapse if further tremors are felt , &quot; a police official said . 
earthquakes between five and six on the Richter scale are powerful enough to cause heavy damage in populated areas . 
more than 700 people were killed when an earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale hit Udayapur in eastern Nepal in 1988 .
