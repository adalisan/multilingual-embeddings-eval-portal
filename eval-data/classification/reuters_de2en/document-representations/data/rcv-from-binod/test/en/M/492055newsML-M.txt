after struggling through one of the most volatile weeks in recent memory , U.S. financial markets should calm early this week before tackling another round of data and an advance batch of first quarter earnings reports . 
last week , the Dow industrials shed more than 214 points -- the fourth largest weekly point loss total in New York Stock Exchange history -- while bond yields edged up to their highest level in seven months . 
the Dow Jones Industrial average closed Friday at 6,526.07 , up 48.72 . 
the record loss was still the 295.98-point fall in the week ended October 23 , 1987 , the week of the Black Monday crash when the Dow had a one-day drop of 508 points . 
less than a month ago , the Dow was tearing into record ground , leaping to 7,085.16 on a perfect investment climate . 
the dollar , with one eye on U.S. asset markets , also had a roller-coaster week , slipping to a seven-week low against the mark early , before ending on a positive note in tandem with stocks on Friday . 
this week , first quarter earnings will begin to exert their hold over Wall Street , beginning with Motorola Inc &apos;s report after Monday &apos;s stock market close . 
On-target or better-than-forecast earnings from Motorola could give the high-technology sector , which rebounded late last week from a sharp selloff , a further boost . 
but analysts say the real test will come with International Business machines Corp , Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp earnings , due out later in the period . 
&quot; My feeling is that we &apos;ve had enough of a short term correction to allow for some rally here , but the real problem over the next few weeks is going to be earnings , &quot; Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer and Co . , said Sunday . 
&quot; You &apos;ve had some warnings from major corporations like Eastman Kodak Co and IBM and I think a lot of investors will be eyeing the first quarter results to see if there &apos;s real pressure on margins , &quot; he added . 
another problem for stocks is competition from bonds , market analysts said . 
expectations of higher U.S. interest rates , in the wake of Friday &apos;s U.S. employment report , pushed long-term yields well above 7.0 percent . 
with the stock market swooning , asset allocators may be tempted to start moving their money out of equities and into less-risky debt instruments . 
&quot; Bonds with yields over seven percent become tough competition for equities , &quot; said Alan Ackerman , executive vice president and market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co . 
&quot; The real issue now is whether we see a readjustment of portfolios that will cut off some of the heavy flow of money into equity funds . 
on Friday , AMG Data Services , a fund tracking firm , reported that U.S. equity mutual funds had suffered their first redemptions of the year in the week ended April 2 . 
Bob Adler , president of AMG , said the net redemptions reflected investor response to a declining market , calling the week &apos;s action &quot; a graphic example of declining investment sentiment . 
in addition to earnings , the key to investor confidence going forward will be the U.S. interest rate outlook . 
this week , retail sales data will provide a glimpse at the demand side of the economy -- what many believe is the key to the economy &apos;s future and near-term Federal Reserve policy . 
economists surveyed by Reuters are expecting a solid gain of 0.6 percent in March retail sales after a robust 0.8 percent increase in February and a whopping 1.5 percent climb in January . 
&quot; Retail sales are probably going to be very strong again , &quot; said Christopher Low , senior economist at HSBC Markets Inc , citing recent data which showed strong auto sales in the month , including higher sales of costly light trucks . 
low said early tax refunds and hefty bonuses for high income individuals were most likely at the root of the first quarter retail sales strength . 
he predicted a negative reaction from the bond market on Friday -- when the sales data is scheduled to be released -- but suggested yields could be nearing their peak . 
&quot; I think that we &apos;re probably fairly close to the high in yields but maybe not quite there yet , &quot; Low said . 
&quot; People are reluctant to buy until they see what the Fed does , but on the other hand we are hearing more and more inquiries from investors asking when they should come in and buy .
