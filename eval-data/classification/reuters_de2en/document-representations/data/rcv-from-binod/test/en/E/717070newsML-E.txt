Britain plans to increase its trade with India to 5.0 billion stg from 3.2 billion by the year 2000 , Britain &apos;s president of the board of trade Margaret Beckett said on Wednesday . 
&quot; A target for two-way trade of 5.0 billion pounds by the year 2000 has been set , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Last year such two-way trade amounted to 3.2 billion pounds which was an increase of 20 percent on the previous year . 
speaking at a conference organised by the Confederation of British and Indian Industries , she said she was sure this level could be achieved . 
British exports to India rose to 1.8 billion stg in 1996 from 900 million stg in 1992 , Beckett told the delegation , which included the British and Indian High Commissioners and the Indian minister for industry Murasoli Maran . 
there had also been a dramatic rise in the level of British investment in India in the last few years . 
but she said she would like to see the smaller and medium-sized businesses in various sectors achieve more . 
&quot; Business people in both India and Britain should become more aware of each others &apos; capabilities , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Major publicity programmes are planned for both countries .
