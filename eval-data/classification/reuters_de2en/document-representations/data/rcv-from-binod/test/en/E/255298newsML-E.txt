the Massachusetts Emergency Board on Friday decided not to allow Middlesex County to borrow funds to cover debt payments due the same day , a spokesman for the state attorney general said . 
&quot; The county came to the board to ask them to authorize borrowing . 
the board voted three to one against them , &quot; the spokesman said . 
Middlesex ran into trouble over selling a county hospital , as the sale is expected to close five days after $ 4.5 million of unrated revenue anticipation notes are due . 
the sale proceeds and remaining receivables will not be nearly enough to meet all hospital-related liabilities . 
the attorney general &apos;s spokesman noted that Middlesex , the state &apos;s largest county , has other potential strategies , though he did not disclose them . 
&quot; They have other options beside coming to the board , &quot; he said , referring further questions to county officials . 
the emergency board , set up by legislation in 1991 , is composed of State Treasurer Joe Malone , Attorney General Scott Harshbarger and a representative from Gov. 
William Weld &apos;s Administration and Finance Department . 
this was its first meeting .
