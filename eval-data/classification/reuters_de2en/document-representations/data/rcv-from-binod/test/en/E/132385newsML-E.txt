the United States has sharply boosted its competitiveness over the past decade but it remains vulnerable to challenges from abroad because of long-term economic weaknesses , the Competitiveness Council said Tuesday . 
the non-partisan council , which groups 150 business , Labor and academic leaders , said those weaknesses include rising income inequality , paltry savings and an education system that is not providing workers with the skills they need . 
unless those challenges are met , the United States will face difficulties in maintaining living standards for most Americans , much less improving them , the council said . 
&quot; The United States has out-performed all of the advanced industrial economies during the 1990s , but the payoff has been slim in terms of increasing the incomes of many Americans , &quot; the council said in a its report . 
it attributed the gains in competitiveness over the last decade to a variety of factors , including corporate restructuring , budget deficit cuts , a weaker dollar and success in opening up markets abroad . 
the increased competitiveness has meant that the United States has enjoyed faster growth , lower unemployment and bigger exports since 1985 than rival industrial nations . 
looking ahead to the next 10 years , nearly all the council members surveyed expect the United States to perform as well or better than its fellow members of the powerful Group of Seven -- Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy and Japan . 
Germany in particular is expected to lose out , with 40 percent of those surveyed forecasting that it will fall behind over the coming decade . 
increasingly , though , council members see the main foreign competitive threat to the United States coming not from the G7 , but from the emerging market economies of China , South Korea , India , Brazil and Mexico . 
&quot; The G7 countries are not the challenge anymore , &quot; said Harvard University professor Michael Porter . 
&quot; The challenge now comes from the newly emerging economies . 
those nations pose both a threat and an opportunity because as they grow , their demand for foreign goods will rise . 
&quot; It is a good news / bad news story for the United States , &quot; said W. R Timken , chairman of Timken Co . , which makes bearings and special steels . 
&quot; There are tremendous opportunities and tremendous threats , so advanced competitiveness is even more important to maintain and enhance our standard of living . 
Council members overwhelmingly pinpointed upgrading worker skills as the most important competitiveness challenge facing the United States in the next decade . 
increasing savings and investment were also mentioned as important . 
for its part , the federal government should focus on improving education and cutting the budget deficit , the council said . 
&quot; There is a difference between the end of competitiveness and the means , &quot; said Jack Sheinkman , President emeritus of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union . 
&quot; High and rising living standards are the main goal , while economic growth and strengthened competitiveness are only the means . 
on that score , council members were not so optimistic . 
while they expect the United States to continue to do well in terms of job creation , a majority see wages at manufacturing companies staying stagnant over the next decade , although employees at service firms should do better . 
&quot; While U.S. industry looks stronger and some progress has been made in putting the nation &apos;s financial house in order , there are good reasons to be concerned about our economy , &quot; said former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker . 
&quot; The toughest choices and most difficult adjustments still lie ahead .
