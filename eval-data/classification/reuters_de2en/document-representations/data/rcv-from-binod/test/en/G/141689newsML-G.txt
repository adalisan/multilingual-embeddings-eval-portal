a specific fund should be set up to coordinate rural development efforts in Europe , Irish MEP Liam Hyland said on Thursday . 
some 30 billion Ecus of EU structural funds have been allocated for rural development between 1995-99 but schemes tended to be fragmented and lacking in effectiveness . 
&quot; A separate rural development fund to coordinate financing of rural programmes would be a major step forward , &quot; Hyland , author of an agricultural committee report on rural policy , told a news briefing . 
he gave no details about the size of the proposed fund . 
the report was prepared ahead of a rural development conference organised by the European Commission in Cork , Ireland , from November 7-9 . 
Lord Plumb , who will chair the conference , said it will lay the basis for the future of rural areas . 
&quot; It is crucial that the EU starts to create practical measures and policies needed to take rural communities into the next millenium , &quot; he told the news briefing . 
Lord Plumb , leader of conservative MEPs , noted that over 80 percent of Europe is rural and 25 percent of Europeans live in rural areas . 
but although agriculture was still very important , other sectors , such as tourism and handicrafts , had developed more rapidly and now accounted for the majority of jobs , he noted .
