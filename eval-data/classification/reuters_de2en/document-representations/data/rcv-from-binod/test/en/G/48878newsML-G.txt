Burundi &apos;s military government has announced plans to restored parliament and lift the ban on political parties outlawed after a July coup which prompted regional states to impose an economic boycott . 
but Belgium , the former colonial power , is making plans to help its citizens leave Burundi , where around 150,000 people have been killed in three years of civil war . 
the Belgian embassy in Bujumbura said it was making arrangements in the light of deteriorating conditions in the country . 
details would be announced later , an embassy statement said . 
Jean-Luc Ndizeye , spokesman for Tutsi military ruler Pierre Buyoya , said the government would hold a news conference at 4 p.m. ( 1400 GMT ) on Friday to explain its plans for a revival of political life . 
Buyoya , a retired major and former military ruler , suspended political parties and the national assembly after seizing power on July 25 from a president blonging to the Hutu majority . 
regional states cut transport links and oil supplies to the landlocked country and blocked exports of coffee , the main cash earner , listing the restoration of the assembly and unbanning of parties among conditions for the lifting of the embargo . 
the sanctions were also intended to pressure Buyoya into talks with rebels from the Hutu majority , which makes up 85 per cent of the country &apos;s six million people . 
Buyoya said he took power in an effort to prevent genocide and announced plans for up to three years of transitional government . 
the army threw out Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya , who has been holed up in the U.S. ambassador &apos;s residence in the Burundian capital since shortly before the coup . 
the United Nations has said it fears Burundi could go the way of its northern neighbour Rwanda , where up to a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in fighting and genocidal massacres in 1994 . 
the Burundi government and senior members of the Catholic church blamed Hutu rebels for an ambush in which the country &apos;s most senior Catholic churchman was killed on Monday . 
Archbishop Joachim Ruhuna and two nuns were killed in the attack on the jeep near Burundi &apos;s second city , Gitega . 
four members of the entourage , including the driver , survived the attack . 
the archbishop &apos;s body has not yet been found .
