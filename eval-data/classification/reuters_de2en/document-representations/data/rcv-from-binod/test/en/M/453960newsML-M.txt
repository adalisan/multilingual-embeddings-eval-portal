gilts will continue to offer investors relative value over the next few weeks in the run-up to the British election on May 1 , analysts said on Wednesday . 
with higher yielding bonds hit by market speculation about a delay to European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , and with Bunds also suffering , gilts have been attracting overseas investors . 
analyst say that trend is set to continue . 
&quot; We are quite keen on gilts despite the election , &quot; said David Keeble , at Credit Suisse First Boston . 
&quot; It is not going to have a major impact being mostly in the market already . 
optimism about gilts is running high even as strong economic data highlight the need for interest rate rises , they add . 
analysts said the 10-year gilt yield spread against Bunds was set to narrow . 
at 1150 GMT , the gilt / Bund gap was at 181 basis points , having been at 185 at the beginning of the year . 
&quot; Once we get the election uncertainty , for what it is worth , out of way , the spread against Germany should go down to around 140 basis points , &quot; Keeble said . 
Andrew seaman , a fund manager at Guinness Flight in London , also said the election was not likely to affect gilts too much in the medium term , and gilts offered reasonable value in an uncertain environment . 
&quot; The risk premium is quite high so that unlike many other markets you are compensated from some of the economic risks , &quot; he said . 
&quot; And today &apos;s wage inflation data was one of those risks . 
earlier , data showed a larger than expected rise in average earnings of 5.0 percent in the year to January after an upwardly revised 4.75 percent increase in December . 
jobless figures for February showed a 68,200 fall , also more than forecast . 
notwithstanding these numbers , Kevin Adams , gilts analyst at BZW in London , said the market had a healthy background . 
&quot; On an EU harmonised basis UK inflation is in line with the rest of Europe , and may well fall below that of the rest of Europe over the next few months , &quot; he said . 
concerns were creeping into Italy , Spain and Sweden about whether EMU will happen on time and set against that backdrop gilts should perform well , analysts said . 
&quot; If some of the EMU premium goes out of those markets it is not unreasonable to expect the cash to head for another home and for the UK to certainly pick up some of that , &quot; said Adams . 
but analysts diverged as to which area of the yield curve held the most attraction for investors . 
Adams noted a steep slope between two and 10-year gilts . 
he said two-year gilts were discounting a profile which suggested rates would go up to around seven percent over the next year . 
&quot; That may well be sensible , but typically there should be some risk premium in a bond and there really isn &apos;t any at the short end of the market , &quot; he said . 
the 10-year area was particulary favoured by international investors and looked cheap compared to both the very long and the short end , he said . 
he suggested a barbell trade where short and long dated paper is sold and medium maturities are bought . 
&quot; You can pick up about seven or eight basis points in yield doing that out of the fives and 20s and going into the 10s at the moment which looks quiet good value , &quot; he said . 
Keeble said he would prefer to stay in the two and three year area going into the election and thereafter move to the 10-year sector . 
however seaman took a longer term view and recommended the very long end on a duration weighted basis . 
&quot; There are likely to be rate hikes in the UK and if they turn out to be higher than the market is expecting we should see the curve flatten , and the long end will benefit , &quot; he said .
