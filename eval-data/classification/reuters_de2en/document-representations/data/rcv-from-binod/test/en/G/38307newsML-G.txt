a senior British diplomat convicted of smuggling a large collection of &quot; depraved &quot; child pornography into Britain from Japan was sentenced on Friday to three years in jail . 
Robert Coghlan , 54 , a divorced father of two who spent 30 years in British embassies around the world , appeared shocked and bowed his head as the judge passed the sentence . 
&quot; I am satisfied beyond doubt that you always knew that large numbers of these video cassettes involved the exploitation , abuse and degradation of children , &quot; said Judge Gerald Butler at Southwark Crown Court in south London . 
&quot; If it were not for men such as you to provide a market for this filth , there would be no incentive for others to manufacture and sell them for their own profit . 
the jury at Southwark Crown Court in south London took only 52 minutes before reaching a unanimous guilty verdict on Thursday . 
Coghlan bought much of the paedophile material while serving as first secretary in the information department at the embassy in Tokyo , prosecutors said during his trial . 
he was still busy building up his illicit video collection when he helped the Princess of Wales around Tokyo during a visit to Japan in February last year . 
believed to be the first British diplomat to be found guilty of smuggling pornographic material , Butler said he presumed the verdict would mean an end to Coghlan &apos;s diplomatic career . 
a spokesman for the Foreign Office said &quot; disciplinary action will be taken &quot; but would not comment further . 
videos , photographs and magazines considered obscene in Britain but not in Japan were found in Coghlan &apos;s belongings during a routine customs search before they were shipped out of Britain to his new posting in Spain . 
Prosecutor Nigel Lithman told Southwark Crown Court that 70 videos were found containing scenes of homosexual &quot; paedophilic depravity &quot; . 
the jury viewed some of the material . 
Coghlan , who has been suspended from duty since March , had denied the charges . 
defence lawyers said the diplomat believed his belongings would go directly to Madrid , where such material is apparently not illegal .
