death row prisoners in Illinois , which has released more condemned inmates than any other U.S. state over the past four years , were given the right Wednesday to DNA and fingerprint tests to clear themselves . 
Jim Edgar said he signed the legislation to provide &quot; a reliable way to verify the guilt or innocence of convicted persons . 
&quot; New York has a law that is similar but narrower in scope . 
the Death Penalty Information Centre reported this month that of the 21 U.S. death row inmates exonerated in the past four years , eight were in Illinois . 
among them were the so-called Ford Heights Four , four men released last year after being wrongly convicted 18 years ago of a couple &apos;s murder in a Chicago suburb , and two men who spent 12 years on death row for the murder of a 10-year-old girl based on false testimony by police that they had confessed . 
the Illinois law would apply to cases where the primary evidence involved identification of the assailant , and where the technology was not available at the time of the trial . 
in Virginia , lawyers for convicted rapist and murderer Joseph O &apos;Dell filed a last-ditch appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court hours before his scheduled execution after a federal appeals court turned down their request for DNA tests on semen samples taken from the victim &apos;s body .
