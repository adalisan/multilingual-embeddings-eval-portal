Central bankers and finance ministry officials from eastern Europe , economists and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) officialstook part in the discussions . 
IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer told a news conference following the seminar that the negative impacts of annual inflation above single digits exceed the costs of reducing inflation . 
&quot; There are very big costs of staying with moderate inflation ( of 10 to 30 percent , &quot; he said . 
the participants of the conference were aptimistic over the outlooks of central European countries , which plan to join the Europena Union ( EU ) over the next five years , he said . 
by the time the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland joins the EU , they are likely to be in good position concerning inflation if their economic policies will be very &quot; serious and disciplined &quot; , he added . 
inflation in April ran at 6.7 percent in the Czech Republic , at 15.3 percent in Poland and at 18.6 percent in Hungary . 
Fischer said that Hungary took serious steps in economic adjustment and inflation reduction recently and the government &apos;s plans to reduce inflation by four to five percent in 1997 and 1998 were considered rqalistic at the conference . 
&quot; To bring the inflation down by four to five percent a year ... would be impressive , &quot; he said . 
Hungary targets inflation levels of 16 to 17 percent for the end of this year and and 13 to 14 percent for December 1998 .
