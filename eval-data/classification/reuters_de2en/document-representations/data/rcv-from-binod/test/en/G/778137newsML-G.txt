Michael Johnson lived up to his top billing at the world championships on Tuesday when he blazed to his third successive 400 metres title in 44.12 seconds . 
Johnson , one of four Americans in the final due to the wild card granted by the world governing body , took control of the race 100 metres from home after Britain &apos;s Iwan Thomas and Olympic bronze medallist Davis Kamoga of Uganda set the early pace . 
Kamoga held on for the silver in 44.37 seconds , ahead of American Tyree Washington who won the bronze in 44.39 . 
Johnson , whose season was disrupted by injury suffered in his head-to-head 150 metres race against Canadian Donovan Bailey in Toronto in June , looked as powerful as ever down the home straight , accelerating clear of the field to win by two metres . 
seven of the eight finalists completed the race in under 44.60 seconds . 
Johnson was all smiles on his victory lap , which he completed holding a Superman T-shirt to the delight of the biggest crowd in the stadium since the championships started .
