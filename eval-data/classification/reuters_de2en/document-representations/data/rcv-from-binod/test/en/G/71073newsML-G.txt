British scientists said on Monday they thought they have isolated a gene which is an important precursor of the deadly Alzheimer &apos;s disease that causes progressive dementia . 
researchers at applied Biogenes Ltd told Reuters they have applied for a patent for their work , which could allow doctors to identify people most at risk from the disease and prevent it from taking hold . 
the discovery also offers the hope of discovering drugs to combat Alzheimer &apos;s , which affects around 800,000 people in Britain alone and is almost impossible to diagnose and treat . 
a spokesman for applied Biogenes said its researchers have found a gene which deposits a key protein associated with Alzheimer &apos;s in the brain . 
&quot; If you have this gene it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean you will get Alzheimer &apos;s , &quot; he said . 
other factors also contribute to the onset of the condition . 
but he added that as a result of the work , &quot; development of a simple method for either diagnosis of the predisposition to this disease or prognosis can be achieved . 
the next step for applied Biogenes &apos; molecular biologists will be to look at ways of blocking or modifying the action of the gene to stop Alzheimer &apos;s from developing , and working on drugs for its prevention . 
the spokesman said it may be several years before patients can benefit from the discovery of the gene . 
the company , which employs just five people , eventually intends to license its technology to pharmaceutical companies , although no talks have been held with potential partners . 
applied Biogenes said it may also have isolated a gene which predisposes people to multiple sclerosis , although work on this project was not as far advanced as on Alzheimer &apos;s .
