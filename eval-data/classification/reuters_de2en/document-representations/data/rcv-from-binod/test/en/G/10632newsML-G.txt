the Romanian government on Friday approved a treaty ending longstanding disputes with neighbouring Hungary and it is ready for signing , Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu said . 
he said the accord , essential for both countries &apos; ambitions to join NATO and the European Union , could be signed in the first half of September . 
&quot; The opportunity for finalising the treaty resulted from a compromise by both sides and I really don &apos;t see any obstacles which might prevent the Romanian and Hungarian parliaments ratifying it , &quot; Melescanu told a news conference . 
Hungarian and Romanian experts met for two days this week in Budapest to put finishing touches to the treaty . 
four years in the making , the pact was long delayed by disputes over minority rights for Hungarians in Romania . 
the leftist government of the Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) accepted the text at a cabinet meeting on Friday , said Melescanu , and ministers from nationalist coalition partner , the Romanian National Unity Party ( PUNR ) , did not object . 
&quot; All ministers agreed the treaty should be signed as early as possible , &quot; said Melescanu , rejecting press reports that the PUNR would try to block the treaty . 
PUNR leader Gheorghe Funar has asked for a referendum on the historic deal . 
in turn PDSR chiefs have threatened to kick his party out of the ruling coalition if it is obstructive . 
Hungary said on Wednesday it was set to sign the accord , despite criticism from opposition parties and ethnic Hungarian politicians in Romania . 
there are 1.6 million Hungarians in Romania , some seven percent of the population . 
Hungary had sought ethnic autonomy for its kinfolk , which Bucharest rejected , mindful of Hungary &apos;s long rule over what is now central Romania and fearing a Yugoslav-style secession . 
a deal was struck after Bucharest included a Council of Europe-approved clause on minority rights which Budapest then acknowledged did not grant Hungarians collective privileges . 
Melescanu said he hoped the treaty would be the starting point in a process of reconciliation between the two countries , which have strengthened commercial and military links since the 1989 fall of communism despite sporadic political bickering .
