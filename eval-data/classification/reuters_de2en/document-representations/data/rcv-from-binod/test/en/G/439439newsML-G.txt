Singapore opposition politician Tang Liang Hong , who fled the city-state after January elections , said on Thursday he would remain abroad due to the ruling party &apos;s deluge of legal action against him . 
Tang told reporters he wanted desperately to return home but was afraid he would be put in prison if he did so . 
&quot; My heart , my mind is in Singapore , &quot; Tang told reporters . 
&quot; In my youth , I spent my time struggling for Singapore &apos;s independence . 
Tang was a candidate for the opposition Workers Party and lost a hotly contested seat in a multi-member constituency for parliament in the January 2 Singapore general elections . 
the ruling People &apos;s Action Party ( PAP ) swept 81 of the 83 seats at stake in the polls . 
he fled after the elections and has not returned to Singapore since , saying he feared for his life and freedom . 
Singapore officials , including Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong , have consistently denied Tang would be imprisoned if he returned to Singapore . 
Tang said he had made inquiries about the possibility of seeking political asylum in various countries but gave no details . 
he said he was worried he would become an exile . 
&quot; This problem disturbs me every night , &quot; he said . 
he said he had no regrets about standing up against the Singapore government but found it difficult to accept the pain inflicted on his wife and daughter who still live in the city-state . 
&quot; My immediate problem is how to reunite with my family , &quot; Tang said . 
the opposition leader said he was afraid of being extradited to Singapore but thought that was unlikely . 
he hoped Kuala Lumpur would allow him to stay in the southern Malaysian state of Johor for a few more weeks , he said . 
Tang was found guilty last Monday in 12 of the 13 lawsuits , including charges of libelling Goh , Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and other members of the PAP for comments made during the election campaign . 
the court had already ordered him to list all his assets in an affidavit and set aside those worth Singapore $ 11.2 million ( US $ 7.8 million ) to cover possible damages and costs if he was found guilty . 
Tang has vowed to fight back and has claimed the charges against him would collapse if he succeeded in an appeal against the court &apos;s decision .
