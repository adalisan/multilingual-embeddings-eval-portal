Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said on Monday he hoped to complete a draft agreement on future partnership between NATO and Russia in talks with the alliance &apos;s secretary-general on Tuesday . 
Primakov told reporters in Strasbourg on the eve of his meeting with NATO chief Javier Solana in Luxembourg : &quot; I want this meeting to be the last one and to enable us to sign on May 27 . 
the possibility of signing the document will be totally cleared up tomorrow . 
the minister was speaking after talks with the so-called troika of past , present and future holders of the European Union &apos;s rotating presidency , led by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo . 
he repeated Moscow &apos;s ritual denunciation of NATO plans to admit former Soviet bloc central European countries as &quot; the most serious error since the end of the Cold War &quot; . 
but he added that a Russia-Nato document should minimise the repercussions on Russian security . 
NATO sources in Brussels cautiously welcomed Primakov &apos;s comments , saying they could be interpreted as indicating Moscow realised that NATO had reached its final position in the negotiations and was ready to conclude a deal . 
President Boris Yeltsin has agreed in principle to sign an agreement with leaders of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in Paris on May 27 but U.S. and NATO officials have previously said they were not sure it would be ready in time . 
the West has rejected Russian demands for legal commitments not to station nuclear or conventional forces on the territory of new NATO members or to build military infrastructure there . 
but it has said it has no plans to deploy nuclear weapons or permanently station forces there . 
U.S. and Russian officials reported some progress after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held two meetings with Primakov in Moscow last week . 
&quot; Mr Primakov is a fine tactician and negotiator and he will probably try for some little final concession to save face and Russian honour , but I think he realises that NATO is now close to its bottom line . 
the Russians have to substantially modify their position to get an agreement , &quot; a NATO source said . 
&quot; If he is indicating he is ready , that is very encouraging indeed , &quot; the source said . 
earlier on Monday , a Russian foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Moscow and NATO had resolved most of the problems blocking agreement on a post-Cold War partnerhip and progress now depends on the Western alliance . 
the source said differences remained on military matters and the onus was on Solana to make a breakthrough in his talks with Primakov on Tuesday . 
Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary head the queue of former members of the defunct Warsaw Pact expected to be offered NATO membership at a summit in Madrid in July . 
&quot; The Russian side has shown its negotiating partners its cards and NATO has shown its cards , &quot; the Russian foreign ministry source told Interfax . 
the source said Moscow was sticking to demands for a clear , binding agreement on military matters . 
&quot; The Russian side insists everything here is utterly clear and concrete . 
NATO would like to get off with passionate declarations saying they have no plans , or intentions or reasons , let &apos;s say , for stationing nuclear weapons on the territory of new member states of this bloc , &quot; the official said . 
he added : &quot; An assertion has any sense only if it is set out in a legally binding document . 
Yeltsin seemed to drop demands for a legally binding treaty at a Russia-U.S. summit in Helsinki in March but wants an accord to be signed by himself and NATO heads of state or government . 
Western officials say the agreement would set up a joint council with Russia , giving Moscow a voice in important decisions affecting its security interests in Europe .
