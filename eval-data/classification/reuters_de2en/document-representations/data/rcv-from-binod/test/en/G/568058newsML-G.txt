Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui has asked Premier LIEN Chan to reshuffle his cabinet next week , a senior official said on Wednesday . 
&quot; I have retained Premier LIEN Chan ... I have asked LIEN Chan to make some adjustments in cabinet , &quot; Wu Poh-hsiung , ruling Nationalist Party secretary-general , quoted Lee as saying at the party &apos;s central standing committee meeting . 
Wu said LIEN tendered his resignation on Sunday to take responsibility for the government &apos;s failure to check violent crime , an issue which came under intense scrutiny following the murder of a popular actress &apos; teenage daughter . 
&quot; The top priority is to resolve the case , &quot; Wu quoted Lee as saying . 
the premier would give his reshuffle list for approval during next Wednesday &apos;s central standing committee meeting . 
Taiwanese were shocked by last week &apos;s discovery of the body of 17-year-old Pai Hsien-yen , daughter of actress Pai Ping-ping . 
her kidnappers , who dumped her naked body in a river , have not been caught . 
more than 50,000 people demonstrated on Sunday to demand the resignation of LIEN and a cabinet reshuffle .
