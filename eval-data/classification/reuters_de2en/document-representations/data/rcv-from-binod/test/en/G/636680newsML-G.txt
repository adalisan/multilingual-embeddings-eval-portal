jitters ahead of Mexico &apos;s national elections and fears of higher U.S. interest rates pushed up Mexico &apos;s bellwether 28-day Cetes paper at Tuesday &apos;s weekly central bank auction . 
rates rose at the shorter end of the yield curve but fell very slightly in the one-year term . 
the widely-watched one-month paper rose 99 basis points , slightly more than expected , to 19.30 percent . 
an earlier Reuters survey of money market dealers predicted a rise of 71 basis points in the 28-day paper . 
&quot; The market was ready for this . 
rates were coming off a low level and now that we &apos;re in June , people are looking at the elections and U.S. rates , &quot; said Scott Grimberg , an analyst at mms International in New York . 
the rate hike was sharper than last week &apos;s rise , which broke two weeks of falling rates that had pushed the yield on one-month paper down to 18.07 percent . 
demand fell slightly to 10.55 billion pesos from 12.7 billion the week before . 
&quot; The market is showing nerves ahead of the elections , &quot; said Enrique Ramirez MENA , a money market analyst at Santander Investment in Mexico City . 
&quot; The only rate that fell was the one year paper , which is pretty logical given a better long-term fundamental outlook once elections are over , &quot; he added . 
Mexicans go to the polls on July 6 to elect most of Congress , six state governors and , for the first time , a mayor of Mexico City . 
recent polls show President Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s Institutional Revolutionary Party might lose its majority in the lower house of Congress for the first time in seven decades . 
analysts said many investors have discounted a pri loss in the lower house , but are not too worried because the most likely beneficiary will be the conservative National Action Party , whose economic policy is similar to that of Zedillo . 
but recent gains by the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) have blurred the picture , causing some to wonder how big gains by the PRD could affect the government &apos;s economic goals of liberalisation and lower inflation . 
&quot; The market has not priced in a PRD victory , &quot; Grimberg said . 
adding to tension is the grim prospect of another hike in U.S. interest rates . 
the Federal Reserve is slated to meet on July 2 to set interest rate policy . 
Grimberg said positive news on inflation , due out a day before next week &apos;s auction , could tame any further rises in short-term rates . 
investors will be watching the peso closely in the next few weeks to see how it reacts to pre-election nerves and April revised trade figures .
