* Central Bank seen buying $ 49 million 
rising domestic interest rates buoyed the Philippine peso to close at 26.353 on Wednesday from 26.359 in an actively traded market , traders said . 
the day &apos;s average was at 26.353 from 26.360 as volume swelled to $ 201.6 million from $ 146.5 million . 
&quot; There was a lot of selling of dollars , &quot; a big bank dealer said . 
&quot; Fund managers deemed it favourable to hold the peso in their portfolio . 
since Treasury bill rates jumped about 0.50 percentage-points on Monday , rates at the secondary market had likewise risen and attracted dollar inflows , dealers said . 
moreover , banks preferred to hold pesos in case of liquidity tightness next week when banks remit income tax payments to the government , dealers said . 
traders said the Central Bank continued to intervene intermittently through the day to limit the peso &apos;s strength . 
one dealer estimated the Central Bank bought about $ 49 million at various rates from 26.350 to 26.355 .
