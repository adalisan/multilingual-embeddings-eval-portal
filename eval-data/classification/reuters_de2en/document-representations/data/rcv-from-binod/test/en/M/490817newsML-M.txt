Mexican stocks closed higher for the fourth session in a row Monday on cautious buying amid gains by Mexican ADRs on Wall Street . 
&quot; It &apos;s a technical rebound , swayed by the Dow Jones , which has a very firm support at 6,500 points . 
nonetheless , the market is listless , as if no one quite believes in what is happening , &quot; said Jaime Fernandez , an equity analyst at the Interacciones brokerage . 
the blue chip IPC share index ended up 40.36 points , or 1.08 percent , at 3,792.83 . 
trading volume was dull at just 50.3 million shares , of which one cross trade alone accounted for 7.4 million . 
&quot; Volume tends to be thin when the market is on a downward trend , and the overall downward trend has not changed , despite gains over the last four sessions , &quot; Fernandez said . 
&quot; There is also considerable uncertainty in the market over the outlook for Cetes ( Treasury bill ) rates this week , &quot; he added . 
Banco de Mexico will hold its weekly auction of Mexican government securities on Tuesday evening . 
the Dow Jones meanwhile closed up 29.84 points at 6,555.91 . 
Telmex L shares climbed 32 centavos ( four centavos ) to 15.96 pesos ( $ 2.02 ) , while their ADRs ended up one dollar at 40-3 / 8 . 
on the broad market , 102 stocks were traded , of which gainers outnumbered decliners by 51 to 25 . 
retail chain Grupo Salinas y Rocha headed the prominent gainers &apos; list , up five centavos ( less than 1 cent ) to 55 centavos ( 7 cents ) . 
traders noted that although the stock had traded at low volume , it had been gaining strongly since last week on speculation a controlling stake in the company was to change hands . 
publishing company Grupo Fernandez Editores also chalked up solid gains , up eight centavos ( 1 cent ) to 1.69 pesos ( 21 cents ) . 
Grupo Carso gained 1.20 pesos ( 15 cents ) to 46.30 pesos ( $ 5.86 ) following its acquisition of a controlling stake in sears de Mexico from sears , Roebuck and Co . , traders said . 
sears de Mexico B1 shares declined two centavos ( less than 1 cent ) to 17.60 pesos ( $ 2.23 ) . 
retailers Cifra and Comerci were prominent losers , but traders said this was due to light profit-taking rather than fundamental weakness . 
Profit-takers trimmed two centavos ( less than 1 cent ) off Cifra , which closed at 10.94 pesos ( $ 1.38 ) , while Commerci ended down 22 centavos ( 3 cents ) at 5.30 pesos ( 67 cents ) .
