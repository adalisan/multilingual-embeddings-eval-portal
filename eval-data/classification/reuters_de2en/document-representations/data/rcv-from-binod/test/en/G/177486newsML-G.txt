Tony Adams , on his own admission a recovering alcoholic , on Friday received confirmation that England coach Glenn Hoddle retains faith in his leadership qualities . 
Adams will be captain for the World Cup qualifier against Georgia in Tbilisi on Saturday , having regained his England place after a serious knee injury . 
the 30-year-old Adams , England &apos;s skipper in their march to the semifinals of Euro 96 and winner of 45 caps , takes over from injured striker Alan Shearer . 
his reinstatement is for this match only , but Adams said : &quot; I am grateful that the manager has shown great faith in me . 
Hoddle said : &quot; Tony has all the credentials that make a good captain ... he &apos;s got the experience . 
his form is as good as ever . 
&quot; It &apos;s made him a better person and a better player . 
he &apos;s as sharp and as lean as I &apos;ve ever seen him . 
Paul Gascoigne , controversially included in the squad despite public anger over allegations of wife-beating , must wait to know if he will play in England &apos;s 100th World Cup match . 
Hoddle will delay naming his team , although he has hinted that Gascoigne will be left out . 
the player &apos;s effectiveness at 29 , having twice recovered from serious injury , is diminishing . 
England currently lead European qualifying group two , after beating Moldova and Poland . 
but Georgia , under former dynamo Tbilisi defender Alexander Chivadze , demonstrated their resilience last month in losing only 1-0 away to group favourites Italy . 
a packed house of 80,000 is expected in Tbilisi &apos;s Boris Paichadze stadium for what should be an emotional homecoming for the 23-year-old Georgi Kinkladze , who signed for Manchester City for two million pounds ( $ 3.2 million ) last year . 
he is one of 10 Georgian players who fled their impoverished homeland to find more lucrative terms abroad . 
&quot; Our chances are probably 50-50 but we have the ability to beat England and it would be the biggest thing in my career if we won , &quot; Kinkladze said . 
Hoddle said the poor state of the pitch in Tbilisi , which players have said is full of bumps and bare spots , could be a factor in the contest . 
but he added : &quot; They are a very technical team and it will cause them problems as well .
