LIFFE coffee futures ended Wednesday with modest gains on late short-covering after the market had sank to a five-month low earlier in the session . 
traders said the rebound , seen as a technical correction to the sell-off , also came on the heels of a mid-morning rally in New York after a weak start . 
it did not materialise and short-covering came in , &quot; said one trader . 
benchmark September , which touched a five-month nadir at $ 1,530 a tonne in the morning , came back in the afternoon to end at the session &apos;s peak at $ 1,620 for a $ 35 gain . 
on Tuesday , the contract broke through key support levels at $ 1,720 , $ 1,695 and $ 1,610 in one of the heaviest single-day losses in weeks on fund long liquidation .

small speculators initiated the selling on Tuesday after September broke through the $ 1,720 level . 
large-scale fund selling kicked in when it triggered the $ 1,680- $ 1,690 support in the morning . 
on the charts , traders said next key support after $ 1,530 was $ 1,500 . 
on the upside , today &apos;s high at $ 1,620 would offer some resistance .

Sept / Nov spread narrowed to $ 10 at the close from $ 24 on Tuesday . 
new York &apos;s arabica futures had a weaker start before embarking on a rally , seen mainly chart-driven , ahead of midsession .

a large proportion of the increase was robusta , both certifiables and non-certifiables . 
London &apos;s uncovered postion fell 1,951 lots to 11,806 as at the end of Tuesday , reflecting what some traders said was fund liquidation .
