broad optimism about the economy and falling interest rates sent South Korean stocks to a sharply higher close on Wednesday , and analysts said the market could rise another 15-20 percent before the end of the year . 
&quot; The economy now appears to have passed the worst point and liquidity remains ample . 
these factors are expected to keep the market bullish for a while , &quot; said Shim Choong-bo , research manager at Daishin Securities . 
following a 1.69 percent rise on Tuesday , the South Korean composite stock price index climbed by another 2.54 percent , or 19.26 points , to close at 777.29 on Wednesday . 
the rally was sparked by Tuesday &apos;s announcement that the nation had recorded the first monthly trade surplus in 30 months of $ 97.6 million in June , against a $ 426 million deficit a year earlier . 
export-driven manufacturing and shipping companies stood out on hopes for an economic recovery , while brokerage firms gained on falling interest rates and the stock market &apos;s rally . 
adding fuel to the brisk sentiment , the Bank of Korea said on Wednesday the foreign exchange reserves rose to $ 33.3 billion at the end of June from $ 31.9 billion a month earlier . 
analysts said falling interest rates and a planned expansion of the foreign stock ownership ceiling later in the year would also boost the stock market . 
&quot; The central bank is expected to keep liquidity loose this year as inflationary pressure is weak and the bank is now focusing on capping the won &apos;s rise , &quot; said Lee Keun-mo , head of research at the Seoul branch of ING-Baring Securities . 
the local currency is now on an upward trend against the dollar in line with the yen &apos;s strength versus the greenback in international markets . 
Lee said inflationary pressure was weak due to the relatively high unemployment and lacklustre private spending in line with the economic slowdown . 
the finance ministry said on Tuesday growth of the consumer price index , the nation &apos;s major inflation indicator , had slowed to four percent in June from a year earlier &apos;s 5.5 percent . 
&quot; Interest rates will fall further as corporate cash demand will gradually drop as many are at or near the final stage of their inventory adjustment period , &quot; said Shim of Daishin . 
despite slowing capital investment , analysts have said high cash demand to make up for rising inventory-carrying costs had so far kept interest rates from falling sharply . 
South Korea &apos;s benchmark three-year corporate bonds were trading at 11.59 percent , compared with 12.60 percent at the end of last year and this year &apos;s highest level of 13.00 percent . 
however , analysts said the stock market had also negative factors , such as expected share selling by commercial banks and a high level of outstanding margin loans . 
they said local banks were expected to sell shares to reduce their share holding to international standards proposed by the Bank for International Settlements and other organisations . 
they estimate share holding by local banks had reached over 60 percent of their shareholders &apos; equity , among the highest by international standards . 
&quot; Banks and other institutions want to reduce their share holdings , banking on the stock market &apos;s rally and the planned rise in the foreign ownership ceiling , &quot; said Lee of ING-Baring . 
the government plans to raise the limit on foreign ownership in local shares , currently set at 23 percent of a company , this year .
