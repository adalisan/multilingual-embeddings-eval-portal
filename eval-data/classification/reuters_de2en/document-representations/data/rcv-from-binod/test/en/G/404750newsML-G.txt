assumed the job in April 1994 . 
he leaves his post on March 15 .

Ayala Lasso , a former U.N. ambassador and international lawyer from Ecuador , had been criticised by some diplomats and human rights groups for his relatively low profile in drawing public attention to abuses and violence . 
he has also been criticised by some Western diplomats for reacting slowly to killings in Burundi and the Balkans .
