soymeal basis offers in rail markets continued to sink on Friday , mostly in response to an ongoing drop in soybean basis , dealers said . 
&quot; Because of where the margins are and the fact that the beans have loosened up , crushers are just crushing as much as they can , &quot; said one broker . 
Merchandisers at crushing plants said there was little trade on Friday . 
many end-users are waiting to see whether dry areas of the U.S. Midwest receive rain over the weekend . 
&quot; I guess everybody is waiting to see whether it rains or not , &quot; said one broker . 
&quot; The ( CBOT ) board is either going to be limit up or limit down on Monday , &quot; the broker added . 
the National oilseed Processors Association put the crush for the week ended July 30 at 23.577 million bushels . 
that figure was lower than last week &apos;s crush of 23.891 million but within trade expectations for 22.70 million to 24.20 million bushels .
