cancer cases are expected to at least double globally during the next 25 years , with the most worrying trend the number of women developing lung and breast cancer , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) said on Monday . 
circulatory diseases , including heart attacks and strokes , will also continue to rise , especially as people in developing countries adopt unhealthy habits such as smoking and sedentary lifestyles , it added . 
&quot; dramatic increases in life expectancy , combined with profound changes in lifestyles , will lead to global epidemics of cancer and other chronic diseases in the next two decades , &quot; the U.N. agency said in its annual report based on 1996 data reported by its 191 member states . 
&quot; The number of cancer cases is expected to at least double in most countries during the next 25 years , &quot; it added . 
yet &quot; The World Health Report 1997 : conquering suffering , enriching humanity &quot; said millions of premature deaths and disabilities were largely preventable . 
who called for a campaign to encourage healthy lifestyles and improve disease detection . 
the report &apos;s focus is non-infectious diseases -- cancer , circulatory diseases , mental disorders including Alzheimer &apos;s , respiratory conditions , diabetes and disabling diseases including arthritis . 
such chronic diseases kill more than 24 million a year , or almost half total deaths worldwide . 
most of the balance are caused by infectious diseases which claim 17.3 million lives . 
coronary heart disease is the leading killer disease , causing 7.2 million deaths a year . 
the world &apos;s highest rates are now found in eastern and central Europe , according to WHO . 
cancers which kill 6.3 million and cerebrovascular diseases including strokes , which account for 4.6 million deaths , follow . 
the top cancer killers worldwide , accounting for 60 percent of all cancer cases and deaths , are those of the lung , stomach , breast , colon-rectum , mouth , liver , cervix and oesophagus . 
&quot; The most ominous trends are in lung cancer and breast cancer ... As tobacco consumption is increasing in many developing countries , the lung cancer epidemic seems certain to continue and grow . 
&quot; Lung cancer is not only the biggest killer and the most common of cancers -- almost a million deaths a year and over 1.3 million cases -- it is also preventable , &quot; WHO said . 
lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in American women . 
&quot; There will be a 33 percent rise in lung cancers in women and a 40 percent increase in prostate cancers in men in European Union countries alone by 2005 , &quot; it added . 
globally , 85 percent of lung cancer cases in men and 46 percent in women are due to smoking , according to WHO . 
smoking accounts for one in seven of all cancer cases worldwide . 
two thirds of stomach cancer cases are in developing countries , with a drop elsewhere during the last 30 years attributed to better nutrition . 
China accounts for 55 percent of all liver cancer , also a major problem in poor countries . 
breast cancer is on the rise in most parts of the world , particularly in regions which previuosly had low rates , WHO said . 
&quot; Studies show that the incidence in women who migrate from low to high-risk regions slowly rises over two or three generations to the rates of the host country , &quot; it said . 
this illustrated the importance of lifestyle as well as hormonal risk factors in developing breast cancer , it added . 
at least half of breast cancer victims survive at least five years after diagnosis . 
chronic diseases can stem from a genetic predisposition , but lifestyle factors increase the risks -- including smoking , heavy alcohol consumption , poor diet and inadequate physical activity . 
prevention of high blood pressure is vital in avoiding deaths from coronary heart disease , while high blood cholesterol levels are usually related to a diet rich in animal fats . 
&quot; hypertension is considered both as a disease category and as one of the major risk factors for heart disease , stroke and kidney disease , &quot; it said . 
&quot; The major risk factors are overweight , poor dietary habits , particularly excessive intake of salt and alcohol , and inadequate physical activity . 
&quot; lack of physical activity is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor in many industrialised countries , &quot; it added .
