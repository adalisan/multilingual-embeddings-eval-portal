the Moroccan opposition on Sunday called on Arab countries that have normalised their ties with Israel , including Morocco , to freeze relations with the Jewish state . 
in a joint statement , the four-party opposition group , which hold 125 seats in Morocco &apos;s 333-seat parliament , denounced &quot; the recent savage agression against Palestinians and their national authority &quot; . 
the group called on Arab governments &quot; to freeze all relations with Israel and reinforce the front of Arab unity &quot; . 
clashes broke out between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza last Wednesday after Israel opened a tunnel for tourists near Moslem holy sits in Arab East Jerusalem . 
nearly 70 people have been killed , with Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers exchanging gunfire and Israeli troops firing on demonstrators hurling stones . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to go to Washington this week for an Arab-Israeli summit with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
Jordan &apos;s King Hussein and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have also been invited . 
the Morrocan parties that issued the statement were the old-guard Istiqlal , the Socialist Union of People &apos;s Forces , the Socialist and Progress Party and the Organisation of Democratic and Popular Action . 
Moroccan King Hassan , a discreet architect of the Middle East peace process , earlier this week accused Israel of ignoring peace commitments and enforcing a policy that could bring instability and violence to the region .
