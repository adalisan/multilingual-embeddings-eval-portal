the Seattle mariners released veteran right-hander Dennis Martinez Saturday , quite likely ending the career of one of the most successful Latin American pitchers in baseball history . 
the 42-year-old Martinez was ineffective in nine starts with the mariners this season , going 1-5 with a 7.71 ERA . 
in 49 innings , he surrendered 65 hits , including eight home runs , while walking 29 and striking out 17 . 
he lasted only 1 2 / 3 innings in his last start Wednesday . 
the Nicaraguan native has 241 career wins , just two shy of the major league mark for Latin American pitchers held by Hall of Famer Juan Marichal . 
nicknamed &quot; El Presidente , &quot; Martinez is in his 22nd year in the majors and came to Seattle after three seasons with the Cleveland Indians . 
Martinez was limited to 20 starts last year due to right elbow problems and went 9-6 with a 4.50 ERA . 
the nine wins snapped a nine-year streak of double-figure victories . 
the right-hander broke into the big leagues with Baltimore in 1976 and pitched for the Orioles for 11 seasons , battling an alcohol problem along the way . 
he was dealt to Montreal in June 1986 and enjoyed a resurgence in eight years with the Expos , tossing a perfect game at Los Angeles in 1991 . 
after appearing on three All-Star teams and leading the majors with a 2.39 ERA in 1991 , Martinez signed as a free agent with Cleveland in 1994 . 
Seattle replaced Martinez on its roster with 35-year-old Mike Maddux -- older brother of Atlanta &apos;s four-time CY Young Award winner Greg Maddux .
