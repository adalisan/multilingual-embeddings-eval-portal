Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic resigned on Tuesday as vice-president of the ruling party in a major setback for reformist forces in the republic , sources said . 
the Main Board of the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro , prompted by Serbia &apos;s President Slobodan Milosevic , voted no confidence in Djukanovic , authoritative sources close to the Montenegrin government told Reuters . 
the 35-year-old prime minister has launched a comprehensive privatisation programme and has urged Montenegro &apos;s opening to the world separately from Serbia , isolated by an outer wall of sanctions and under western pressure for human rights abuse . 
Djukanovic has publicly criticised Milosevic and sided with the Serbian opposition which protested for three months over an local election fraud last November . 
under Djukanovic , the tiny republic has managed to privatise up to 95 percent of its economy . 
Serbia has not even embarked on that road yet . 
Montenegro is the only ally of Serbia in the new Yugoslav federation . 
the three-month long politicial upheaval in Serbia has hurt Montenegro when potential investors shied away from the unstable region . 
Serbian hardliners in turn accused Djukanovic of treason for his trips to the United States and of leading the country towards secession . 
sources close to Montenegrin party leadership said the pro-western politician , having lost political support by his party , was now expected to resign also as the tiny country &apos;s prime minister . 
if confirmed , Djukanovic &apos;s ouster will be a victory for Milosevic who has pressed for Djukanovic &apos;s resignation for months . 
the DPS Main Board also called for the resignation of Djukanovic &apos;s top ministers , including minister of the interior , chief of state security and the chief of the republic &apos;s privatisation agency , the sources said . 
&quot; This is horrific news , just horrific , &quot; a senior Montenegrin executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity . 
&quot; This is a takeover by Serbia which is drawing us back to the Dark Age , Milosevic style , &quot; he said . 
there was no official confirmation and Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic was expected to hold a news conference later in the day .
