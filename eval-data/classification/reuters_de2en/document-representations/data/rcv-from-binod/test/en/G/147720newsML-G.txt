saying racial quotas &quot; pit one American against another , &quot; Bob Dole on Monday called for ending many affirmative action programmes favoured by U.S. President Bill Clinton . 
with only eight days until the election and lagging in the polls , the Republican presidential nominee tried to rally conservatives in a major speech underscoring his support for the California Civil Rights Initiative ( CCRI ) which would end race and gender-based preferences in state hiring , contracting and education . 
he said voters who supported the initiative needed to cast two votes -- one for the ballot measure and one for him , charging that Clinton would do everything possible to preserve and protect quotas . 
&quot; The overwhelming majority of Americans and Californians believe as I do that we should promote equal equality for all , without regard to race or gender ... but at the same time we believe it is wrong to use quotas , set-asides and other preferences , &quot; Dole said . 
&quot; Opponents of CCRI falsely charge that it is merely a response to the anger of white males . 
but we have seen , in case after case , that quotas and preferences have also hurt women and Asian-Americans , &quot; Dole said . 
dole previously endorsed the initiative , which is opposed by Clinton . 
to replace current affirmative action programmes , Dole has called for preferences based on income rather than race or gender , and vigorously enforcing existing civil rights laws . 
but in the waning days of his campaign his advisers have decided to step up their focus on affirmative action and immigration , two emotional issues in this key state which has 54 of the needed 270 electoral college votes to win the White House . 
dole told reporters on Sunday he considered affirmative action and immigration wedge issues , a common term for sensitive issues used to divide voters . 
while admitting he had previously supported some affirmative action programmes , Dole couched his past support for the contentious initiative on Monday as a move to unite Americans and an extension of his civil rights commitment . 
promising that if elected he would work to wipe out racism in America , Dole quoted former Minnesota Democratic Sen. Hubert Humphrey , a civil rights champion , in warning that quotas divided Americans . 
&quot; Most of all , as Hubert Humphrey predicted , preferences have become a source of polarisation ... pitting one group against another . 
they have given government sanction to racial tension , creating distinctions that become barriers , that become battlegrounds , &quot; Dole told a specially selected , mostly white audience . 
&quot; There is no doubt that if there should be a second Clinton administration ( it ) would do everything in its power to undermine CCRI , &quot; Dole said , charging that Clinton had eliminated only one of 160 federal programmes granting racial preferences and tried to carve out additional quotas . 
Clinton , who mounted a major review of affirmative action programmes , has called for mending , not ending them , saying that there is still discrimination in America . 
California Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson , a main proponent of the ballot measure , told reporters on Sunday , &quot; a wedge issue it seems to me is what your opponent doesn &apos;t want you to talk about . 
this is a real issue , and a wedge that is dividing people is the unfairness of preference . 
State polls have shown a majority of voters support the ballot measure . 
the Dole campaign has made a strategic decision to focus much of its time and millions of dollars in advertising in this huge state . 
along with affirmative action , the campaign is honing in on the emotional issue of illegal immigration -- running hard-hitting television and radio ads . 
a Los Angeles Times poll last week put Dole 20 percentage points behind Clinton here , but strategists say their internal polling shows them trailing the president by only single digits .
