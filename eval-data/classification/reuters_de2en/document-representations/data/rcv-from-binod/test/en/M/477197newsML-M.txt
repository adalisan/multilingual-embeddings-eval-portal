the Indian rupee held steady against the dollar on Monday after brief jitters as political uncertainty engulfed the country , dealers said . 
the Congress party on Sunday withdrew vital support for the minority United Front coalition and mounted a challenge to form a government . 
the rupee lost 10 paise from last week &apos;s close to 35.99 per dollar in initial trading but recovered as panic that the country would face another period of political drift abated and the central bank signalled it could step in to sell dollars . 
by midday the rupee had bounced back to 35.91 / 92 , little changed from the opening of 35.91 / 93 and only slightly down from Thursday &apos;s pre-Easter weekend close of 35.89 / 90 , dealers said . 
despite restored stability , the market was left guessing the future of the government , the direction of economic reforms started in 1991 and the fate of the 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) budget . 
foreign exchange dealers said they expected the rupee to weaken only if importers panicked and rushed to the market to buy dollars . 
&quot; If importers begin covering , the rupee could touch the 36 per dollar mark in the next few days , &quot; said Moses Harding , chief foreign exchange dealer at the private sector IndusInd Bank . 
&quot; I think today &apos;s movements in the rate are an indication of the way trade is going to be in the next few days , &quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank , who declined to be identified . 
&quot; There was a knee-jerk reaction in the morning but this subsided soon and the rupee bounced back pretty fast , &quot; he said . 
if the rupee does slide to 36 per dollar it could send nervous importers on a dollar buying spree , some dealers said . 
&quot; psychologically , this may be the barrier to look out for , &quot; said a dealer at the Bombay branch of a European bank . 
&quot; If 36 is broken , there may be some nervousness and we may see importers scrambling for dollars . 
&quot; In turn , exporters may then choose to keep off , looking for further depreciation in the rupee which will give them better realisations , &quot; he added . 
however a run on the rupee was unlikely , other dealers said . 
&quot; The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) is sitting on record foreign currency reserves , &quot; said a dealer at a state-run bank . 
India &apos;s foreign currency assets touched an all-time high of $ 21.16 billion on March 21 , sufficient to cover seven months of imports , according to central bank data . 
&quot; They ( RBI ) can easily defend the rupee if required , &quot; the dealer said . 
analysts felt that a drop in the value of the rupee was however inevitable . 
&quot; The rupee has been fairly stable against the dollar over the last 10 months , &quot; said Aashish Pitale , analyst at ICICI Securities and Finance Company ( I-Sec ) , Indian affiliate of J.P. Morgan . 
&quot; In fact , in real terms , it has appreciated , &quot; he said . 
what the RBI will probably do is use its reserves to even out any volatility and ensure that there isn &apos;t the kind of steep fall which will disrupt the market , &quot; Pitale said .
