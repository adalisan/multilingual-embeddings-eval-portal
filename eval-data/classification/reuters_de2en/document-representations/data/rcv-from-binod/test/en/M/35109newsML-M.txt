U.S. Plains cattle markets remained slow Thursday , with only light sales reported for off-grade cattle at $ 69.00 , steady with last week , feedlot sources said . 
most feedlot operators had been anticipating active sales at $ 70.00 amid ideas that packers would be in the market soon to replenish live inventories to meet new beef orders . 
Labor Day holiday beef usage reportedly was strong enough to clean out many retailer stocks , and subsequent re-ordering was lifting boxed beef prices , market sources said . 
boxed beef prices at midday were quoted unchanged to up $ 0.26 , with 187 fabricated loads sold . 
the heavyweight choice cuts have advanced $ 1.59 since Friday . 
Feedlot cattle prices also were expected to be underpinned by tighter supplies of finished cattle , the sources said . 
however , if sales are light this week , then carryover supplies on showlists could dilute outlooks for higher cattle prices next week , they said .
