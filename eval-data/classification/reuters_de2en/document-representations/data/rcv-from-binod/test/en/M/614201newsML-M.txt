French shares plunged and the franc slipped on election jitters on Monday but German stocks surged to a record high in thin but volatile trade against the background of market holidays in Britain and the U.S. 
the dollar picked up from overnight lows against the mark and was also steady at firmer levels than Friday against the yen , in a narrow range at just over 116 yen , but dealers said activity was muted because of the holiday . 
all eyes were on France , however , where markets caught a cold after the combined left defied most expectations to outpoll the ruling centre-right coalition in the first round of the country &apos;s parliamentary election . 
prices later steadied somewhat as domestic investors saw little scope for radical policy changes . 
but the blue-chip CAC-40 index , which opened down 106.03 points or 3.84 percent at 2,656.87 , was still down nearly 3.25 percent at 1115 GMT . 
the franc lost just over half a centime to the mark but had backed off overnight lows by midday . 
traders and analysts said the modest move in the currency reflected two things -- the first round victory is no guarantee of the final result and few currently believed a Socialist government will renege on France &apos;s commitment to European monetary union . 
&quot; Really and truly this is still just a case of wait and see , &quot; said Richard Hill , head of foreign exchange trading at Bank of America in London . 
&quot; Any worries that are out there are about the potential to derail EMU . 
at 1115 GMT , the mark was trading at 3.3756 francs compared with 3.3698 late on Friday and a high overnight at 3.3773 . 
investors , betting on a good showing by France &apos;s conservative RPR-UDF coalition , had driven the CAC-40 up 0.78 percent to close at 2,762.90 points on Friday . 
shares in companies the current government plans to privatise but whose future could be affected by a possible left win in the parliamentary election fell sharply on the back of the vote . 
among the biggest losers , defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF was down 5.49 percent on concern that a Socialist-led government would try to block its privatisation and Renault stock was down 4.03 percent on worries its restructuring plans , entailing job losses , might also be held up . 
Dassault Aviation , slated to merge with state-owned Aerospatiale , also suffered . 
it was suspended limit down at the opening at its lower limit of 1,112 francs . 
it closed at 1,230 on Friday . 
&quot; The stock market , putting its trust in opinion polls showing the right would win , had treated the election as a non-event . 
we are going to pay for it because the market had not taken the political risk fully into account , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; We are faced with the worst possible scenario . 
is the right going to return the votes in their favour in the second round ? 
if the left wins , what is going to happen to the Maastricht Treaty ? 
and what about issues such as Thomson , &quot; another dealer said . 
a dealer in Madrid was more sanguine , commenting : &quot; The defeat of the centre-right coalition will have a negative effect on markets but it won &apos;t be anything special because what is really important is the second round . 
meanwhile , German shares , which started a shade weaker , picked up and were 1.6 percent stronger at a new high by midday , helped by the stabilising dollar and Friday &apos;s strong performance on Wall Street , where the Dow closed up 1.21 percent . 
and in Brussels dealers said the bourse was booming on the back of a wave of mergers and speculation remained rife about alliances in the financial services sector . 
some analysts say these are still needed , despite news on Friday of a merger between the country &apos;s seventh and eighth largest banks , non-listed Bacob and Paribas Belgium . 
on Friday it closed up 10.0 points , or 0.21 percent , at 4,661.8 .
