figures in brackets compare against previous day &apos;s close 
-------------------------- ( March 21 ) ---------------------------- 
new Zealand debt securities ended the week flat to a fraction stronger compared to Thursday &apos;s close , but on a spread basis they performed quite well . 
the three and 10 year maturities both finished a basis point lower in yield , at 7.77 and 7.87 percent . 
on the spread to the dollar bloc the mid bonds narrowed the gap against the U.S. by seven points . 
they also outperformed Australian mid bonds , which have recently taken to heart the prospect of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve when the Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday . 
&quot; It was a pretty good day really . 
there was not a lot going on , but it was better than a few of the recent days when it &apos;s actually sold off when it &apos;s been like this , &quot; one Wellington dealer said . 
a NZ $ 70 million seven-year bond corporate bond issue from New Zealand Post was seen as &quot; fair to slightly good value &quot; and would probably trade quite well , dealers said . 
the April 15 , 2004 bonds will be priced at a fixed re-offer margin of 0.57 percent over government 4 / 04 bonds , and have a coupon of eight percent . 
in the money market , 90-day bank bills ended steady at 7.60 percent as the currency &apos;s Trade-Weighted Index continued to trade in a fairly narrow range . 
the June futures contract finished a basis point weaker at 92.25 , with a moderate 1,280 contracts traded . 
dealers expect trade to remain thin until Tuesday &apos;s FOMC was out of the way , and noted the U.S. Treasury market had priced in a rate hike of 25 basis points . 
one said that even if the Fed surprised the markets by not tightening monetary policy , U.S. traders were likely to remain bearish . 
&quot; There would be an initial short-covering rally , I would have thought , but then they &apos;ll say well it &apos;s a definite on-the-cards for the next one ( FOMC meeting ) . 
they might get into the tightening mode ... and continue to be a little bit weak .
