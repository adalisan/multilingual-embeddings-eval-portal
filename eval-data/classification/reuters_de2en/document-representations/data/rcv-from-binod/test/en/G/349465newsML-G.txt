a bomb ripped through a privately-owned bus in the northern Indian town of Panipat on Saturday , killing one person and injuring 18 , officials said . 
they said the blast occurred as the bus stood in the main bus station of the town , some 100 km ( 60 miles ) north of New Delhi in Haryana state . 
&quot; One boy , 10 years old , died , &quot; district chief Jaiwanti Sheokand told Reuters by telephone from Panipat . 
eighteen people were undergoing treatment for injuries in three different hospitals , she said , adding she did not expect any more deaths . 
&quot; This was a low-intensity improvised explosive with a mixture of potassium chloride , sugar and acid , &quot; she said . 
&quot; tentatively , they ( police ) came to the conclusion there was no timer , &quot; she added . 
&quot; The blast took place as the bus stopped and people were getting down , &quot; Rajpal Khurana , conductor of a state-run bus service in Haryana , who was present at the site of the blast , told Reuters by telephone from the bus station . 
&quot; We carried away the injured people to hospital in scooter rickshaws , &quot; said Khurana . 
&quot; Three of the people appeared serious . 
they were covered with blood and in some cases the bones were visible . 
it seemed as if their legs had been severely damaged . 
two people suffered multiple fractures , said Dr. K.L. 
Batra , medical chief of Panipat &apos;s civil hospital . 
&quot; Most of the injured have lacerated wounds and minor abrasion . 
nothing serious , &quot; he added . 
&quot; This is the third explosion in the area and looks like some ( organised ) group is involved , &quot; F.C. 
Kansal , Haryana &apos;s police chief , told Reuters at Chandigarh , the state capital . 
bomb blasts in northern India are usually blamed on suspected Kashmiri or Sikh separatists . 
on January 21 , police in Delhi seized five kg ( 11 lb ) of explosive from a raid on a city hotel and arrested three suspected Kashmiri separatist militants . 
the raid came ahead of the Republic Day , January 26 . 
officials said separatists had planned blasts to mar the day when India celebrates the adoption of its republican constitution in 1950 . 
on January 4 , two bombs , one in a bus and the other in a taxi , exploded minutes apart in the Indian capital killing one person and injuring 11 . 
the bus was on its way from Delhi to Sonepat , located on the highway that connects to Panipat . 
at least 31 people were killed in three separate bomb attacks in the capital over the past year .
