the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will delist a handful of less-active currency and equity index options from its GLOBEX electronic trading system , the exchange said Tuesday . 
Brazilian real options in the third and fourth strikes from at-the-money are also slated for delisting at that time . 
the contracts are being dropped due to lack of activity on GLOBEX and to open space for future listings , a CME spokesman said . 
their status during regular trading hours is unaffected .
