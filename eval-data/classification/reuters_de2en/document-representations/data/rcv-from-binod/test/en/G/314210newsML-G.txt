Olympic champion Deborah Compagnoni shrugged off illness to clinch her first World Cup giant slalom victory of the season on Friday but Pernilla Wiberg was the biggest winner on a bumpy piste . 
Compagnoni , the reigning world champion , produced an aggressive but composed performance on an icy course to win her second World Cup race of the season , finishing 1.16 seconds faster than second-placed Austrian Anita Wachter over the two runs . 
but overall World Cup leader Wiberg , who is proving herself to be a real all-rounder this season , managed a crucial third place , her highest finish in a giant slalom since 1993 . 
the Swede was able to boost her overall lead over Germany &apos;s defending champion Katja Seizinger to 274 points . 
racing in front of her home fans , Seizinger finished with her face in the snow and her skis heading down the slope on their own . 
she was unhurt but has lost vital ground in the race for the title . 
after some disappointing giant slalom placings in recent seasons , Wiberg wanted to show she could still produce the goods in the discipline which brought her gold at the 1992 Albertville Olympics . 
she proved it emphatically . 
but Wiberg is still refusing to admit she has a chance to win the overall title . 
&quot; Don &apos;t make me nervous by talking about it , &quot; the reigning slalom world champion said . 
&quot; My main goal is the slalom World Cup and to win a downhill . 
it &apos;s too early to talk about the other stuff . 
Seizinger , joint leader of the giant slalom standings at the start of the day , crashed out of the second run after a mistake at the top of the course . 
Second-fastest in the first run , she hit a gate and ended up looking like a beginner on a bad day , hurtling down the course on her stomach with her boots out of her bindings . 
&quot; It certainly wasn &apos;t a soft landing , &quot; she said . 
&quot; But anything can happen when you take risks . 
the course was icy in parts but Compagnoni , who had twice finished second in the discipline in races in Maribor , Slovenia , and the Austrian resort of Soelden , looked in complete control as she clocked an aggregate two minutes 8.45 seconds . 
Compagnoni , who has been suffering from &apos; flu in the past week , was 1.08 seconds ahead of Seizinger after the first run with Wachter third , 1.34 behind . 
Wachter , who won the last race in the German resort in 1991 , clocked an overall 2 : 09.61 with Wiberg third in 2 : 09.92 . 
it was Compagnoni &apos;s second World Cup victory of the season . 
she won a slalom in Semmering , Austria , on December 29 . 
the Italian , who shot to the top of the giant slalom rankings , said the illness might even have helped her performance because she did not have the energy to attack the course . 
in the past she has been too aggressive and lost control . 
like Seizinger , Italy &apos;s Sabina Panzanini also had a bad day after starting the day equal top of the World Cup giant slalom standings . 
Panzanini , who had won two of the three previous giant slaloms , looked uncomfortabley on the course and was unable to make an impact , finishing 16th . 
she is now third in the giant slalom rankings behind Wachter . 
Seizinger slipped to fourth .
