the court also summoned Hossein Allahkaram , head of the group and an officer in the Revolutionary Guards , on charges of &quot; making insulting lectures and fabricating lies towards Khatami , &quot; the newspaper said . 
a special court hearing press offences suspended the magazine Aftabgardan and fined its publisher , Tehran &apos;s pro-Khatami mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi , for publishing an article critical of the state radio and television , IRNA said .

the court also fined Karbaschi 20 million rials ( $ 6,700 ) .
