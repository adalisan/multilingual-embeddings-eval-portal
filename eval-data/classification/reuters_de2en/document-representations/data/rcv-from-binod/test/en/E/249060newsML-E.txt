Colombia &apos;s net foreign reserves stood at $ 8.37 billion at Nov . 22 , the central bank said Wednesday -- their highest level for 13 months . 
the reserve figure was the highest reported since Oct . 28 of last year , when net reserves stood at $ 8.38 billion . 
according to central bank statistics , net reserves increased by $ 44.8 million in the period Nov . 15 to Nov . 22 due to a $ 625.4 million reduction in short-term foreign-currency denominated debt , which outstripped the $ 580.6 million fall in gross international reserves . 
short-term foreign-currency denominated debt dropped to $ 165.4 million while gross reserves fell to $ 8.54 billion . 
between Nov . 1 and Nov . 22 , an increase in foreign investment flows , coupled with a surge in dollar-denominated loans to the private sector and flagging demand for U.S. currency , contributed to the increase in Colombia &apos;s overall reserves . 
in the period Dec . 30 , 1995 to Nov . 22 , the most recent date for which figures are available , the balance in net foreign reserves increased by $ 49.4 million or 0.6 percent . 
the central bank has set a target of increasing net foreign reserves by another $ 1 billion by the end of 1997 .
