Shane Warne believes Australia will face a much more resilient England side this summer and insisted on Thursday that Mike Atherton &apos;s men should not be underestimated . 
Warne took 34 wickets in the last ashes test series in England in 1993 which Australia won 4-1 , but says the touring side will have to work much harder to succeed this time . 
&quot; I think a lot of people are writing them off a bit too early . 
we &apos;re not taking them lightly and we &apos;re not going to be complacent , that &apos;s for sure , &quot; said Warne , who sat out the Australians &apos; opening tour fixture against the Duke of Norfolk &apos;s XI . 
&quot; We &apos;re here to try and win every game we play and to really nail the England side , because we think they &apos;ve got half a chance of beating us . 
some may suspect Warne is simply trying to soften up his intended targets , but the leg-spinner is adamant the series is not a foregone conclusion . 
&quot; I &apos;ve had a lot of success against England , but I think the English players just need to get some team spirit together . 
they &apos;ve always had a good side on paper but they haven &apos;t been able to do the business on the field . 
Warne &apos;s varied assortment of deliveries will be closely studied by the English batsmen before the test series starts , but the blond-haired spinner believes staring at videos is not the perfect answer to playing him . 
&quot; It can help you get a bit of an idea , but the best thing is to stand behind the net and watch . 
Warne , who singled out Jason Gillespie and Matthew Elliott as men the England team should watch out for , realises this summer &apos;s test pitches may well suit the seamers more than himself . 
for that reason he is reluctant to reveal if he has set himself any personal targets for the series .
