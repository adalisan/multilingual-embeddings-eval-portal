Atlanta braves pitcher Greg Maddux claimed his seventh consecutive National League Gold glove award for fielding excellence on Wednesday . 
Maddux , a four-time CY Young Award winner , committed just one error in 109 total chances to earn the honour as the league &apos;s best fielding pitcher . 
he is two shy of the record for NL pitchers held by Bob Gibson , who won nine . 
Maddux , who won three Gold gloves with the Chicago Cubs before picking up four in a row with Atlanta , was joined by braves teammate Marquis Grissom , one of three outfielders selected for Gold gloves by major league managers and coaches . 
Grissom earned his fourth consecutive Gold glove after committing only one error in 349 total chances for a .997 fielding percentage . 
San Francisco giants star outfielder Barry Bonds was the only player not to receive a Gold glove last year who made this season &apos;s list of exemplary fielders . 
but this was the sixth Gold glove in seven years for Bonds , who committed six errors in 302 chances while playing left field in San Francisco &apos;s extremely windy conditions . 
rounding out the outfield was Steve Finley of the San Diego Padres , the only team besides Atlanta with two players cited for fielding excellence . 
in 433 chances , Finley had just seven errors and 385 putouts . 
San Diego &apos;s Ken Caminiti , the leading candidate for National League Most valuable Player honours , was chosen at third base . 
the Padres power-hitter committed 20 errors in 433 chances , but his rifle-like arm , despite playing most of the season with a rotator cuff injury , earned him the honour . 
the other infielders honoured were Chicago Cubs first baseman Mark Grace , Houston Astros second baseman Craig Biggio , Cincinnati reds shortstop Barry Larkin and Florida Marlins catcher Charles Johnson . 
grace picked up his fourth Gold glove after a season in which he committed only four errors in 1,371 chances for a .997 fielding percentage . 
grace was part of 120 double plays and also had 107 assists . 
Biggio earned his third consecutive Gold glove , all at second base after starting his career as a catcher . 
he committed 10 errors in 811 total chances . 
Larkin picked up his third successive Gold glove after helping to turn 80 double plays and adding 426 assists . 
Johnson became the first Florida marlin to win a Gold glove . 
he had only four errors in 825 chances for a .995 fielding percentage with 70 assists . 
the American League announced its winners Tuesday .
