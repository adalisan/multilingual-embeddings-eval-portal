the deals , down from the $ 230- $ 232 range talked end-Thursday , were done in the absence of Wall Street trader Morgan Stanley that had been seen so active on the market for much of this week . 
&quot; It looks like the squeeze is over ; they &apos;ve not been very keen buyers today , they &apos;ve kept a very low profile , &quot; a broker said of Morgan . 
as crude futures also slipped in early trading , August gasoline swaps declined by $ 5 to $ 209- $ 211 after a trade was widely rumoured at $ 211 . 
three September swap deals were meanwhile seen by brokers at $ 194 , later identified as the bid level - leaving September just $ 2 down - while Sep / Oct was valued at $ 6 , Oct / Nov at $ 2.50- $ 2.75 and Nov / Dec at $ 1.50- $ 2 .
