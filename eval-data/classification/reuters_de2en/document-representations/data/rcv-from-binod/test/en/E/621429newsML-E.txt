the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Housing and Urban Development threw its unanimous support behind a $ 375 million bond for affordable housing on Tuesday , State House News Service reported . 
the measure will provide funds to modernize 50,000 low-income housing units by providing $ 220 million for renovations of units most of which are between 30 and 50 years old . 
the bill also provides money to fund new unis for such groups as first-time homebuyers , AIDS patients , battered women and the homeless . 
it keeps tenants from being evicted from their low-income apartments and it also authorizes $ 10 million to make existing units handicapped-accessible . 
the measure must still win the backing of the state &apos;s Long-term Debt and Ways and Means Committees before it can come up for debate on the House floor .
