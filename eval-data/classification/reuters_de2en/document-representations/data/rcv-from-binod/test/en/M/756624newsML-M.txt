the Polish zloty firmed half a percentage point against the basket in early Friday trade and dealers said the local currency &apos;s bull run may push the unit back up toward parity within days , dealers said . 
they said Thursday &apos;s central bank currency-selling intervention , which occured when the zloty slipped just below -1.5 percent from parity , created a strong bullish zloty sentiment on the market and sent the local unit soaring . 
&quot; Polish banks are selling-currencies and so are foreigners and the zloty could rise to zero ( parity ) within days , &quot; said Pawel Gajewski , forex dealer at Creditanstalt in Warsaw . 
at 0755 GMT the zloty was -0.47 / -0.66 percent from the parity rate , against opening &apos;s -1.21 / -1.48 percent from parity and Thursday &apos;s close at -1.49 / -1.55 percent . 
it was at 3.4260 / 20 to the dollar , against 3.4510 / 00 at opening and at 1.8660 / 00 to the mark against 1.8800 / 50 . 
the OECD joined other international organisations in urging Poland to drastically tighten its fiscal policy to contain the fast growing current account deficit . 
it said Poland should cut the budget gap to 1.5 perent of GDP in 1998 and balance the budget in 1999 , while the finance ministry says a 1.9 percent gap in 1998 would be sufficient . 
some dealers said however that the zloty could be subject to some profit taking after rising some five percentage points from last week &apos;s all-time lows . 
on the money market one-day rates eased as banks wanted to place cash on the market for the weekend , dealers said . 
overnight rates fell to 18.50 / 21.00 percent from opening &apos;s 21.00 / 21.20 percent and Thursday &apos;s 21.70 / 22.45 .
