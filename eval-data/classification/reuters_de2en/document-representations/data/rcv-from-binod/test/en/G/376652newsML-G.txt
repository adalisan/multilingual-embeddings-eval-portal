the space shuttle discovery crept through space on Thursday with its robot arm outstretched , ready to capture the Hubble Space Telescope for a $ 350 million refurbishment . 
shuttle commander Ken Bowersox was to fly discovery to within 35 feet 11 metres of the 12-ton orbiting observatory to bring it within reach of the shuttle &apos;s robot arm , operated by veteran astronaut Steve Hawley . 
Hawley , a 45-year-old astrophysicist and astronomer , planned to gently pluck Hubble from orbit at about 3 : 15 a.m. est ( 0815 GMT ) and stow it in the shuttle &apos;s cargo bay . 
&quot; It &apos;s big and bright and beautiful , &quot; said discovery pilot Scott Horowitz as the shuttle closed in on the gleaming telescope . 
during the shuttle &apos;s service call , the astronauts plan to install two improved scientific instruments , each about the size of a large refrigerator . 
a $ 105 million multipurpose infrared camera will allow astronomers to see deeper into the universe than ever before and may discover planets orbiting other stars , while a $ 125 million improved spectrograph will help in the search for massive black holes devouring stars in the centre of galaxies . 
other planned upgrades included a new digital tape recorder , a more accurate guidance sensor for pointing the telescope and various improved electronic boxes . 
since it was repaired in 1993 , the Hubble telescope has provided scientists with the first conclusive evidence for the existence of huge black holes and discovery of planetary nurseries around stars . 
the telescope has also collected light emission data from distant galaxies and other evidence that the universe may be much younger than previously thought .
