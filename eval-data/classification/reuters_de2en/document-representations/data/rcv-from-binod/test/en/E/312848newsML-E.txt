the French Finance Ministry denied on Thursday a report that a group of European countries including France and Germany was secretly negotiating plans to create a single European tax and social security system . 
British daily The Independent reported on Thursday that an alliance of European countries including France and Germany -- but not Britain -- were privately negotiating such a plan . 
the newspaper , citing &quot; papers seen by The Independent &quot; , said the plan envisaged control over income tax being pooled by national governments inside a future single currency zone . 
&quot; We deny it , &quot; said a Finance Ministry spokeswoman . 
&quot; There is no secret agreement between two countries on taxation . 
she said any agreement on a common tax system would have to be negotiated by all 15 European Union states . 
earlier , a spokesman at British Prime Minister John Major &apos;s office said Britain was not aware of any talks between France and Germany along these lines .
