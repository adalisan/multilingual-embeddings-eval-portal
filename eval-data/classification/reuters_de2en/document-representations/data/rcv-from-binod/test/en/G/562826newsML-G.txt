China on Tuesday slammed a Japanese legislator for visiting one of a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea , warning Tokyo the issue could damage Sino-Japanese ties . 
&quot; The illegal landing ... is a serious violation of China &apos;s territorial sovereignty , &quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing . 
&quot; The Chinese side expresses its strong indignation and opposition , &quot; Shen said . 
&quot; The Chinese side will quickly make stern and formal diplomatic representations to the Japanese side . 
Shingo Nishimura , a conservative member of Japan &apos;s main opposition New Frontier Party , and three others on Tuesday landed on one of the islands , called the Senkaku in Japanese and the Diaoyu in Chinese , to inspect security measures and hold a brief commemorative ceremony . 
&quot; The Diaoyu matter will definitely affect the normal development of Sino-Japanese relations , &quot; Shen said . 
&quot; We hope the Japanese side will take effective measures to remove the adverse results and negative effects . 
the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa administers the disputed islands , which are also claimed by Beijing &apos;s arch-rival , Taiwan . 
&quot; The Diaoyu islands have been a part of Chinese territory since ancient times , &quot; Shen said . 
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was quick to distance the central government from Nishimura &apos;s group , which included former cabinet minister Shintaro Ishihara , author of the 1980s nationalist treatise &quot; A Japan That Can Say No &quot; . 
in Taipei , the foreign ministry expressed grave concern over the visit and urged Japan to exercise self-restraint and not to create any trouble that would affect friendly relations . 
the rocky cluster of uninhabited islands has ignited fiery nationalist passions in Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan since a Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse there last July . 
in the months that followed , the lighthouse drew a flotilla of vessels carrying Taiwanese and Hong Kong protesters , several of whom briefly landed on the islands . 
last September , a Hong Kong activist drowned when he jumped into stormy waters near the islands to press China &apos;s claim . 
Japanese government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama said that while the islands were Japanese territory , the group &apos;s actions were &quot; extremely regrettable &quot; and should not be allowed to damage Sino-Japanese relations . 
but Beijing accused Tokyo of not trying hard enough to stop such landings . 
&quot; The regrettable thing is that the Japanese side has not taken effective measures to stop incidents harming Sino-Japanese relations from happening , &quot; Shen said . 
in February , Japan sent a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in which it sought to have Tokyo &apos;s position on the islands included in a U.N. report on the law of the sea . 
the Japanese party that landed on Tuesday also included a local Okinawa politician , Hitoshi Nakama , who visited the island last month in a trip that worried Japanese officials .
