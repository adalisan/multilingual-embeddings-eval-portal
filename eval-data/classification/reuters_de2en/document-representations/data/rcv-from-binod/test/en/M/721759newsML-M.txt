NW European high sulphur barges ended steady on Friday , moving from earlier highs after a trading house cut its price for prompt material , while cargoes were offered steady on low supplies , traders said . 
high sulphur barges traded at $ 86.50 for 5,000 tonnes for July 14-15 loadings , after deals earlier in the day that rose steadily from $ 85.50 to $ 87.50 at 50-cent intervals . 
&quot; offers went as high as $ 88 but then came down , &quot; a trader with a major said . 
only one trader was offering at $ 86.50 and other sellers were holding their ground at $ 87 / $ 87.50 . 
but some traders were sceptical about the higher prices reached at the end of the week , adding that a correction should be looming as overall demand was not too high . 
&quot; There &apos;s enough oil around and demand was not very big for the week as a whole , &quot; one trader said , expecting the market to move to the $ 84 / $ 85 area . 
others saw it steady at the start of next week . 
traders said the market on Thursday broke slightly above the week &apos;s range of $ 85 / $ 86 on better demand that day from market players covering short positions and with tighter cargoes giving support . 
low sulphur barges continued inactive , with little demand seen from the German market . 
traders said levels were notionally unchanged in the $ 94 / $ 95 region for buyers and with sellers at $ 96 / $ 97 . 
no fresh deals were heard in high sulphur cracked fuel cargoes but offers remained steady with avails low . 
at least one M-100 was offerd at two means plus $ 1.50 , but no bids were seen at that level . 
&quot; The avails are low but the numbers the sellers are asking are a bit high , &quot; one trader said . 
buyers of lower quality material were heard bidding around the $ 80 region . 
one percent was also quietly talked in the $ 92 / $ 94 region but no deals were done after a flurry of actvity earlier in the week . 
the supply / demand picture was stable . 
a trader was reported to be putting together a large vessel of low sulphur fuel to meet a supply tender it won in the Far East . 
&quot; The economics to the East are working well now , &quot; one trader said .
