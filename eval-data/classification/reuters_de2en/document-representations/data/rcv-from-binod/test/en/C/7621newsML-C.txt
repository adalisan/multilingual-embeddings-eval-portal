UK tobacco and financial services group B.A.T Industries plc said it did not think U.S. proposals on so-called &quot; youth access &quot; to tobacco would affect its sales of cigarettes in the U.S. 
&quot; We don &apos;t think it would . 
we have already introduced through many stores ( there ) age ID cards and we &apos;re quite happy for that , &quot; a B.A.T spokesman in London said on Thursday .
