Europe &apos;s cash cocoa trade calmed this week following a storm of buying on the back of mounting fears over next season &apos;s main crops in West Africa . 
buyers in Europe have now retreated , having bought large tonnages from all main African origins and taking hefty cover on the terminal market -- sparking a sharp price rally . 
London-traded futures are some 50 stg a tonne higher than a week ago , with the July position trading close to 1,100 stg on Thursday . 
Most-active September was near 1,115 stg . 
this has proved very tempting to origin shippers , who have increased their offers into the market -- some at cut-price differentials . 
traders reported Ivorian , Ghanaian and Cameroon cocoa all being on offer . 
there was also talk of Indonesian selling direct to the U.S. trade . 
&quot; There is a lot of cocoa around , and a lot of it at attractive differentials , but trade is reluctant to pick it up , &quot; one trader commented . 
Ivorian offers for next season &apos;s main crop are most prevalent -- with some shippers offering beans at up to 60 stg under the terminal market . 
Ghana cocoa was reported to be available at a small discount to the relevant terminal position . 
but fears of further price rises , which members of the trade feel could lead to shipper defaults , are deterring heavy buying . 
&quot; There have been problems in the past and we are worried if the price goes up another 100 stg , then we might not get our cocoa , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; We are staying away . 
others said that a sharply rising market also forces those looking to hedge their positions to pay hefty margin calls , and this is acting as a further deterrent . 
&quot; It ties up as lot of your money and until the trade is convinced the market has topped , they &apos;re not willing to step in , &quot; said one trade source . 
he added this left a lot of cocoa unsold in the physical market , a potentially bearish factor . 
&quot; It &apos;s a weird paradox at the moment , but once this cocoa is sold , as it eventually will be , there will be a lot hitting the market , &quot; he said . 
traders cited reports of poor pod setting in the Ivory Coast and fears over the potential effect of the developing El Nino weather system on African rainfall levels as sparking the buying surge some two weeks ago . 
&quot; People took out insurance on the terminal market despite the latest signs that the weather is favourable , &quot; one said . 
another said rainfall levels in the Ivory Coast were good and dismissed the market talk as scaremongering by the bulls . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of misinformation being put into the market and I don &apos;t think the problems will be as serious as some would like us to believe , &quot; he said .
