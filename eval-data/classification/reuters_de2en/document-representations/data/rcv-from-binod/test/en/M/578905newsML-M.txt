Argentine bonds finished lower Tuesday in line with a downturn in U.S. treasuries on the back of a report that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points next week . 
&quot; The report of a rate hike took the U.S. market lower and we followed , &quot; said a trader at a foreign bank . 
still , the Argentine declines were slight and U.S. inflation figures due Wednesday were seen more important in setting direction . 
Argentina &apos;s FRB Brady bond due 2005 fell 1 / 8 to 92-3 / 8 , while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 4 due 2002 was down $ 0.05 at 115.25 . 
the report by Reuters cited a source close to the Federal Reserve as saying : &quot; There is a very good chance the Fed will do another 25 basis points , and virtually no chance it will do 50 basis points . 
however , another trader said &quot; if Wednesday &apos;s ( U.S. producer price ) figure comes out as expected the market should get a boost . 
&quot; analysts are expecting producer prices to remain unchanged in April . 
in the money markets , call money rates rose to 6.48 percent from 6.03 percent .
