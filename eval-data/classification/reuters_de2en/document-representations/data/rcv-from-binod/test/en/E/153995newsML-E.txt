Japan , one of Bangladesh &apos;s main aid donors , on Wednesday warned that the flow of assistance would slow down unless the country speeded up implementation of development projects . 
&quot; ... The utilisation of Japanese assistance has not made any progress during the last two years , &quot; Shuichiro Megata , a senior Japanese government official told newsmen . 
Megata , who is heading a six-Member official delegation to an annual &quot; consultation &quot; with Bangladeshi officials on future aid , said Bangladesh needed to resolve the problems hindering the utilisation of annual aid .
