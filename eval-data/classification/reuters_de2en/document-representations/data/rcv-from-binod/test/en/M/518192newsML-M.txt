prices in sterling show little change , despite firming in Australian fine merino wool values this week , leading to a new seasonal peak for the eastern market indicator . 
currency strength explains the limited movement in local prices . 
traders also say that opportunities for selling overseas are somewhat decreasing where order books are running down . 
home trade demand is not as bad as the export side but it is very competitive and imports are attracted by currency alignments . 
deliveries are going out fairly well for home and export . 
British wool prices softened for some types this week and business in the sector is dull with recent New Zealand weakness unhelpful . 
the proposal to buy the entire Australian stockpile is not being taken very seriously in view of the market distortion that would follow .
