Iraqi Kurdish forces captured the northern town of Ranya early on Saturday and were moving south towards the rival stronghold of Sulaimaniya , officials of the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) told Reuters . 
&quot; We took Ranya this morning and we are close to taking Quala Dizah , &quot; the official said in the KDP headquarters in the town of Salahuddin , 50 miles ( 80 km ) west of Ranya . 
Baghdad &apos;s intervention on the side of the KDP provoked U.S. cruise missile attacks on southern Iraq and a widening of the no-fly zone there . 
the KDP went on to capture the whole of the three Kurdish provinces in the region but last week the PUK began a counter-assault , retaking its stronghold of Sulaimaniya and advancing back to Arbil . 
a senior U.S. official was due to hold talks with KDP leader Massoud Bagzani next week -- probably in Turkey -- to try to end the latest conflict between the two Kurdish groups . 
the KDP official said the party &apos;s guerrillas aimed to surround Sulaimaniya by taking positions around the city and then close in for the final kill .
