Japan &apos;s customs-cleared trade surplus rose 6.5 percent in February from a year earlier to 686.72 billion yen , the first rise in the surplus since November 1994 , the Finance Ministry said on Monday . 
&quot; I think ( these figures ) are certainly indicating that the trend is starting to change . 
we should be seeing from now on the Japanese surplus starting to pick up fairly steadily and starting to contribute positively to Japanese growth instead of negatively . 
&quot; ( The surplus ) brings a plus impact on the Japanese economy -- much more higher growth of Japanese exports , but relatively weak imports . 
but the Japanese sales tax is rising from three percent to five percent from April , so it &apos;s a minus and a plus situation . 
so I don &apos;t know where the Japanese economy is going , but from today &apos;s figures , it &apos;s a very good impact on the real economy . 
&quot; Everybody is looking at these numbers from a year-on-year basis but in fact it &apos;s been increasing since the spring of 1996 if you look at the seasonally adjusted numbers . 
&quot; This should start to exert upward pressure on the yen as awareness grows that the surplus is rising again . 
I think we have seen the peak in the exchange rate for the moment in terms of dollar strength .
