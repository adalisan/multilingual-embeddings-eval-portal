* turnover swells to $ 226.3 million 
the Philippine peso shed 0.50 centavos to 26.285 to the dollar in heavy trade late in the session on Thursday against yesterday &apos;s 26.280 close , traders said . 
one trader said dollar-buying was triggered after the Central Bank increased its selling rate to 26.285 from 26.280 yesterday . 
the Central Bank sold more than $ 150 million out of the $ 226.3 million that changed hands by late trade . 
the bank did not explain why it changed its rate and officials were not immediately available for comment . 
traders said five banks stocked up on dollars , which importers need to load up their inventories ahead of the Christmas season , fearing the Central Bank might increase the rate further . 
&quot; Only five banks were buying dollars from the Central Bank to partly fund their commercial requirements , &quot; one trader said . 
the dollar-buying eventually abated after these banks loaded up on dollars , another trader said .
