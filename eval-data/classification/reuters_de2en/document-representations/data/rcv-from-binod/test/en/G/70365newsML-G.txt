a Filipino communist leader fighting deportation from the Netherlands said on Monday he would only return to the Philippines if Manila helped settle compensation demands by human rights victims under late president Ferdinand Marcos . 
the government must also improve its human rights record before he accepts its appeal for him to return , Jose Maria Sison said in a statement from his exile home in Utrecht in the Netherlands . 
a U.S. federal jury in Hawaii in 1994 awarded $ 1.9 billion to about 10,000 victims and family members of people who suffered at the hands of the Marcos government . 
the abuses were said to include torture , execution and &quot; disappearances &quot; of dissidents . 
Marcos was ousted in a 1986 popular revolt and died in Hawaii in 1989 . 
the 1994 ruling has touched off a welter of legal battles and none of the victims has received any compensation . 
the Marcos family is contesting the judgment and Manila is claiming it has priority over the assets , accusing the Marcoses and their associates of looting up to $ 10 billion from the economy during Marcos &apos;s 20-year rule . 
Sison , who is chief consultant of the communist-led National Democratic Front ( NDF ) in peace talks with the government , said an agreement to execute the Hawaiian jury &apos;s ruling should be part of a peace agreement ending the 27-year leftist insurgency . 
&quot; If the ( government ) refuses to satisfy the demands of the victims of human rights violations , then how can the NDF and the people be convinced that there would ever be a comprenshsive agreement on human rights or any fundamental change in the human rights situation under the regime of Mr Ramos ? 
&quot; he said . 
he said abuses continued to be &quot; rampant &quot; in the Philippines . 
the Philippine Commission on Human Rights , a constitutionally independent body , says the number of violations has decreased to 921 cases in 1995 from 1,763 in 1990 . 
there were two torture cases and 11 alleged &quot; disappearances &quot; last year compared to 25 and 55 respectively in 1990 , it said .
