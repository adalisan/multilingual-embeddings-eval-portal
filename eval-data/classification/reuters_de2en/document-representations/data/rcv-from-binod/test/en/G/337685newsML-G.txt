Israel will return the remains of two Palestinian Islamist militants killed in separate 1994 attacks to their families in self-ruled Gaza , Israeli security sources said on Tuesday . 
they said the bodies of Salah Jadallah and Hassan Abbas , members of the Islamic Resistance Group Hamas , were exhumed from a military graveyard in northern Israel on Tuesday . 
they said the bodies would be transferred to the Gaza Strip on Wednesday . 
Jadallah was killed when Israeli troops stormed a house where he and other militants were holding a kidnapped Israeli soldier in October 1994 . 
in the same month , Abbas was shot dead by Israeli paramilitary police after he and a second guerrilla opened fire on a crowded Jerusalem promenade , killing an Israeli and an Arab from East Jerusalem . 
the Israeli security sources said the bodies were being returned for humanitarian reasons .
