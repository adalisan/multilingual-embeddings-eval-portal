Burundi &apos;s new Tutsi military strongman is opposed to any expulsions of Rwandan Hutu refugees from northern Burundi and has sent a team to investigate the reasons behind their movement , his spokesman said on Tuesday . 
Boyoya &apos;s spokesman Jean-Luc Ndizeye told Reuters by telephone that the new president of Burundi remained committed to international conventions on the protection of refugees . 
&quot; The president expects refugees to stay where they are . 
he does not expect any movements at all today , &quot; Ndizeye said . 
U.N. officials expect thousands of refugees on Tuesday to leave northern Burundi and return to Rwanda . 
they say they fear for their security following an army coup in Burundi on July 25 . 
shortly after the coup by the Tutsi-dominated army , Buyoya ordered an end to forced expulsions of Rwandan Hutu refugees . 
Ndizeye said movements by thousands of refugees from the north since Sunday were not part of official policy and any one found guilty of inciting them would be punished . 
&quot; The president is not going back on his word to protect refugees , &quot; he said . 
the exodus of Rwandan refugees back to Rwanda picked up after troops killed three refugees at Magara camp . 
refugees accused the army of killing them as part of a campaign of intimidation . 
Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Minani , a Burundian army spokesman , confirmed on Tuesday troops killed the three but said they fired only after one refugee pulled out a revolver and shot at them .
