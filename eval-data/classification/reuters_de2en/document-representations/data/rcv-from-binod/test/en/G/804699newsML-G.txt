authorities on Sunday scaled back efforts to find three hikers who disappeared when a flash flood raced through a narrow canyon in northern Arizona last week , killing eight others . 
saying little progress was being made , authorities decided to limit their searches to twice daily checks of a debris-laden pool of water near antelope creek and Lake Powell . 
the missing hikers are presumed dead . 
&quot; We &apos;ve looked over and over and we really weren &apos;t getting anywhere , &quot; said a Coconino County Sheriff &apos;s spokeswoman . 
a massive search has been under way since late Tuesday , when officials reported that an 11-foot-high ( 3.3 metres ) wall of water came crashing down on 12 people in the slim , corkscrew-shaped canyon , killing eight of them . 
one man , a tour guide , made it out alive . 
no more bodies have been found in the murky waters since Friday afternoon . 
the 11 hikers consisted of seven people from France , two from the United States , and one each from Britain and Sweden . 
the British Consulate in Los Angeles identified one of the hikers as Charlotte Warmington , 24 , from Claverdon , Warwickshire . 
the Swedish Consulate in Los Angeles identified another hiker as Anders Wassenius , 22 , from Uddevalla . 
the French Consulate in Los Angeles has declined to release the victims &apos; identities .
