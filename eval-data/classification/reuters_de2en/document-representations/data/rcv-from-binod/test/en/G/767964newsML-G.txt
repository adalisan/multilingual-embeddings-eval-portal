a Ukrainian-registered motorship thought to be carrying hundreds of illegal immigrants suffered power failure in Greek waters and was being towed to port by the coast guard , the Merchant Marine Ministry said on Wednesday . 
the ship was drifting off the Aegean island of Andros with fires burning in barrels on its deck when it was spotted by Greek coast guard vessels at dawn , ministry officials said . 
&quot; It had a total black-out . 
coast guard officials said they saw about 200 to 300 people on board and they think they are illegal immigrants , &quot; a ministry official told Reuters . 
he said tug boats were towing the ship to the port of Lavrion near Athens , where a team of investigators was waiting to go aboard to assess the situation .
