Tokyo stocks are expected to push higher in the coming week as investors weigh in to ensure the indices end the fiscal 1996 / 97 business year to March 31 on a positive note , brokers said . 
analysts said as the 225-share Nikkei average closed above 18,500 on Friday , the barometer could move higher in the coming week with the 19,000 level as the final goal . 
&quot; Hopes that the government plans to revive the stagnant property market will provide psychological support and the start of a new trading month will make it easier , for dealers especially , to buy , &quot; said Hisao Suzuki , deputy general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd . 
&quot; The next main hurdle for the Nikkei average ... is the February 25 closing high of 19,070 , &quot; he said . 
on Friday , banks shares , which had been sold off heavily in the past months were bought back , absorbing losses created by investors who sold to make up for shortfalls in their account books before the year &apos;s end . 
brokers said apart from technical grounds , some market participants were buying back battered bank shares to prop up indices and brighten market sentiment . 
the buying drove the Nikkei benchmark up 139.45 points , or 0.75 percent to finish at 18,633.16 on Friday , topping a five-session winning streak . 
in the holiday-shortened week , it climbed over 700 points . 
such index-rescuing moves are likely to continue until the year-end , brokers added . 
but some warned that when the new business year begins , mass profit-taking could emerge and erase most of the last-minute gains . 
&quot; ( Economists ) say otherwise , but the market believes that the economy is going to slow in the new year and participants are going to be reluctant to hang on to long positions , &quot; a broker at a second-tier brokerage said . 
but in the coming week , brokers said the market will await any hints from the government on the details of its scheme to improve land supply . 
such a plan would help financial firms dispose of poor property assets . 
the finalised plan will be unveiled on March 31 . 
&quot; The government has been revealing its plans in spurts over the past months , &quot; said Masaaki Higashida , Nomura Securities Co Ltd strategist . 
&quot; If the plan falls short of expectations , the indices may retreat in disappointment . 
eyes also will be on currencies and Wall Street , especially any interest rate hike in the United States , brokers said . 
traders widely expect a tightening of the U.S. federal funds rate at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 25 . 
&quot; The market has basically factored in a rate hike of 25 basis points , &quot; said Yasuo Ueki , Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager . 
&quot; But anything more than that or excessive fluctuations following a rate increase have the potential of rattling the Tokyo market . 
analysts expect the Nikkei average to move between a range of 18,200 and 19,300 in the near term .
