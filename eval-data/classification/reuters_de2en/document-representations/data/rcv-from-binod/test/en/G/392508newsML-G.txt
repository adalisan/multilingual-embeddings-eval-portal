South Korean President Kim Young-sam said on Thursday he was saddened by the death of China &apos;s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and expressed hopes that Seoul &apos;s friendly ties with Beijing will be strengthened . 
Kim sent a telegram to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Deng &apos;s family expressing his deep condolences and hailing him as &quot; an outstanding political leader who opened a new chapter in world history &quot; . 
&quot; We wish the Chinese government and people will overcome shocks and sadness from the loss of their great leader and continue to take the path of stability and prosperity , &quot; Kim said in a statement . 
&quot; Our government also hopes friendly ties will continue to strengthen in the future , &quot; it said . 
foreign ministry officials said Deng &apos;s death was expected to delay talks between South Korean and Chinese officials over the fate of a senior North Korean defector taking refuge in Seoul &apos;s Beijing consular office . 
Hwang , ranked 24th in Pyongyang &apos;s hierarchy , arrived at the the Beijing office with an aide on February 12 , forcing China to tread a line between North Korea , its traditional ally , and South Korea , a new business partner . 
&quot; We will refrain from raising Hwang &apos;s issue with Chinese officials for the time being , &quot; a Seoul foreign ministry official said . 
&quot; China and South Korea share the same Asian tradition and you just don &apos;t want to disturb mourning people , &quot; he added .
