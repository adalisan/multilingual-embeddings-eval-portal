North Korean loudspeakers blasted &quot; butchers &quot; and &quot; colonial pawns &quot; in South Korea as boxes holding ashes of 24 Northern submarine intruders were handed back in boxes across the border on Monday . 
the ceremony was intended as a gesture of conciliation by South Korea a day after Pyongyang issued a brief apology for the infiltration by one of its Shark-class submarines in September . 
tied in white cotton bundles with black identification markings , the boxes were handed over one at a time by a 12-member honour guard from the U.S.-led United Nations Command at the border truce village of Panmunjom . 
after troops from the North Korean People &apos;s Army had laid the ashes in wooden coffins , voices booming from loudspeakers on the Northern side of the border praised the intruders as &quot; martyrs that fought like heroes &quot; . 
in stark contrast to the tone of Sunday &apos;s apology -- an unprecedented statement of contrition by North Korea expressing &quot; deep regret &quot; -- the voices , in Korean , delivered blistering attacks on the Seoul government . 
&quot; This incident revealed that the South Korean regime consists of human butchers and colonial pawns , &quot; one said . 
&quot; The soldiers were on a regular training mission and the South Koreans murdered them . 
the handover was arranged by the U.N. command , which monitors a ceasefire that ended the 1950-53 Korean War . 
of 26 North Koreans that landed from the vessel , 11 were found shot dead -- apparently in a mass suicide -- and 13 were killed by Southern forces during a massive manhunt . 
one was captured alive and one is still at large . 
Seoul has said it will not return the captured agent or the submarine , as Pyongyang has demanded . 
Seoul swiftly agreed to send home the remains after Pyongyang &apos;s apology , which was hailed as move towards peace by U.S. President Bill Clinton . 
in its apology , North Korea promised not to repeat such incidents and pledged to work for &quot; durable peace and stability on the Korean peninsula &quot; . 
the apology was issued by the Korean Central News Agency after a series of items attacking South Korean President Kim Young-sam as a &quot; ruthless tyrant &quot; , &quot; puppet &quot; and &quot; traitor &quot; . 
&quot; I am pleased that Pyongyang has pledged to prevent the recurrence of such an incident and has expressed its willingness to work with others for durable peace and stability on the Peninsula , &quot; Clinton said in a written statement . 
&quot; I hope discussions can now begin to move forward on the four-party peace talks which President Kim Young-sam and I offered last April . 
Clinton and President Kim invited North Korea and China to take part in talks aimed at securing a lasting peace to replace the truce that ended the Korean War . 
but independent analysts in Seoul said they were sceptical about whether Pyongyang was ready for face-to-face negotiations with South Korea . 
some said the level of North Korean propaganda attacks on South Korea , which infuriate the Seoul government , would be a good indication of Pyongyang &apos;s true intentions . 
the submarine incursion put on ice the peace initiative , froze international food aid to the hungry North and stalled implementation of a nuclear agreement under which Pyongyang pledged to halt its nuclear weapons programme . 
Pyongyang &apos;s apology was issued after U.S. and North Korean officials hammered out acceptable wording during intense negotiating sessions in New York . 
China welcomed the apology and said it hoped for further relaxation in the new year . 
but it stopped short of a direct response to the invitation to join peace talks . 
&quot; China welcomes efforts made by the parties concerned to remove as early as possible the effects of the submarine incident on the Korean Peninsula and to improve their mutual relations and maintain peace and stability of the Peninsula , &quot; foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said .
