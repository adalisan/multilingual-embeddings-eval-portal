the first known film footage of The Beatles could fetch up to 70,000 pounds ( $ 108,900 ) at an auction next week , Sotheby &apos;s said on Thursday . 
but that price may be topped by the scrawled lyrics for &quot; With a Little Help from my Friends &quot; which the auctioneers believe may fetch as much as 80,000 pounds ( $ 124,400 ) . 
the 35-second film clip of the group at a Liverpool club in February 1961 is one of 800 items of Beatles memorabilia being put up for sale next Wednesday and Thursday . 
a stained piece of old paper , scribbled with blue , black and brown ballpoint pens , is the original handwritten lyric sheet for &quot; With a Little Help from my Friends &quot; . 
provisionally entitled Bad finger Boogie , the second line - &quot; Would you throw a tomato at me &quot; - is crossed out and the words &quot; Would you stand up and walk out on me &quot; are written in their place . 
giving a preview of next week &apos;s sale , Sotheby &apos;s director Jon Baddeley said of the Beatles &apos; enduring appeal to collectors , &quot; As always , they are still top of the pops .
