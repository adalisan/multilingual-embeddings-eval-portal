a 10.9 percent plunge in Singapore &apos;s January electronics output has some economists considering lowering their first quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) forecasts . 
on Wednesday , the Economic Development Board said manufacturing production fell 7.2 percent in January compared to a year ago , dragged down by a 10.9 percent drop in electronics . 
&quot; I &apos;m not surprised there was weakness in electronics but the extent was a bit of a surprise . 
the impact on GDP is going to be felt in the first quarter . 
we probably need to look at the GDP numbers again , &quot; ng Bok Eng , regional economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , said on Thursday . 
for first quarter year-on-year growth , &quot; we have it as five percent ... but most likely there would be some downward revision , &quot; ng said . 
Liew Yin Sze , chief economist at J.M. 
Sassoon , said the poorer-than-expected electronics number has prompted him to keep a close watch on economic data for February and March . 
&quot; It was worse than expected . 
it is not good news , &quot; Liew said . 
referring to January export figures released earlier , he said : &quot; non-oil fell three percent . 
we had expected the numbers to be around there &quot; in the industrial production report . 
Singapore &apos;s non-oil domestic exports slipped 3.1 percent in January year-on-year . 
&quot; We shouldn &apos;t make too much of one month but at the same time it is one-third of a quarter . 
if the other two-thirds don &apos;t show any improvement , it will probably lead to some downward adjustment for first quarter GDP , &quot; said Liew , whose current forecast for first quarter growth is 5.6 percent . 
Basu , director of regional economics at UBS Securities , said he was not surprised by the steep electronics fall because of a high base in the same period last year . 
but he was looking out for leading indicators of global electronics orders for a better indication of Singapore &apos;s economic recovery . 
&quot; If I see further dips in global order flows that would clearly put out the red flag for me , &quot; Basu said . 
he said global orders for electronic components like semiconductors had not been particularly strong in November and December . 
such indicators usually led Singapore &apos;s real exports by between four and six months . 
&quot; If that continues to turn down , it will prompt me to re-look at my forecasts , &quot; Basu said . 
he said he did not expect to revise his first quarter GDP projections of five percent but could lower his second quarter forecast from 6.8 percent if indicators didn &apos;t show signs of recovery . 
economists generally still expected Singapore &apos;s electronics and manufacturing sectors to start posting positive growth rates from the second quarter . 
&quot; The key is not whether recovery will come or not . 
what is important is if recovery will meet expectations , &quot; said ng of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
he said his current expectation was for industrial production to grow seven percent for the year .
