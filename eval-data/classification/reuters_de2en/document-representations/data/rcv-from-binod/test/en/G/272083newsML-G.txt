Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda left Peru on Sunday morning after nearly three days of non- stop diplomacy to try to help rescue the estimated 340 hostages held inside the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima . 
Reporters said Ikeda &apos;s plane took off from Lima airport at around 9 : 20 a.m. est ( 1420 GMT ) for Tokyo , following instructions from prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto . 
Ikeda met President Alberto Fujimori on arrival Thursday night and again on Saturday night before leaving but spent most of his time talking to other diplomats and Japanese community members , leading to speculation that he had been sidelined by the Lima government . 
Japan has most at stake in the embassy drama after Peru , because its ambassador , diplomats , Japanese businessmen and many Japanese-Peruvian nationals are among those being held inside the besieged Japanese embassy residence since last Tuesday . 
early on Tokyo indicated sharp differences with Fujimori &apos;s government over how to handle the crisis but subsequently played down the disagreements . 
Ikeda told reporters before leaving that he supported the general tone of Fujimori &apos;s latest tough message Saturday night to the rebel hostage-takers .
