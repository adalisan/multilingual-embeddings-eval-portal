on May 20 the U.S. policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets and could raise U.S. interest rates . 
&quot; The market is completely dead waiting for the FOMC decision on the interest rates . 
whatever opinions are , nothing would move until then , &quot; Eurobank dealer Olivier Coursault said . 
MinFins with other emerging debt are sensitive to any news which would suggest a further rise in U.S. interest rates , as this would push down U.S. Treasury bond prices . 
&quot; Trading was otherwise quiet as the majority of banks are in a wait-and-see mood until Tuesday , &quot; Mosbiznesbank dealer Pavel Navolokin said .
