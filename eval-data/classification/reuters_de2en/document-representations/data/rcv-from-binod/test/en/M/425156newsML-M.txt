March 6 settlement prev settlement 
key December three-month Euroyen deposit rate futures ended Thursday &apos;s TIFFE day session higher , following a rally in Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures and a fall in Tokyo stocks , traders said . 
the December settled at 99.20 , after trading between 99.18 and 99.21 . 
turnover was 35,541 contracts . 
&quot; The December rose to an intraday high of 99.21 in the afternoon as JGBs extended gains , &quot; said a city bank trader . 
the Nikkei 225 stock average ended down 232.18 points or 1.27 percent at 18,041.33 , after briefly dipping below 18,000 . 
&quot; Short-covering pushed the December higher , but the mood in the Euroyen futures market was still cautious compared with the bond market , &quot; the city bank trader said . 
traders said short-covering pressure could continue to push the December higher in coming sessions , but its upside was likely to remain heavy due to a lack of buying incentives . 
&quot; The December could rise more but its upside is likely to be limited at around 99.23 , &quot; said a trust bank trader . 
in the interbank money market , key unsecured overnight call money was traded at 0.48 percent , down from Wednesday &apos;s weighted average of 0.49 percent . 
the BOJ injected 300 billion yen into the money market , continuing its accommodative stance for a fifth consecutive session . 
Thursday &apos;s fund shorfall was 190 billion yen . 
money traders said the central bank &apos;s accommodative stance was helping to keep the overnight rate below 0.50 percent . 
about 30 billion yen worth of key three-month certificates of deposit ( CDs ) were issued at 0.54 percent , unchanged from Wednesday . 
about 100 billion yen worth of two-month CDs were issued at 0.55 percent . 
they were offered at 0.54 percent on Wednesday . 
one-month CDs were offered at 0.55 percent , unchanged from the previous session . 
money traders said the BOJ was likely to continue its accommodative stance for a while , but might revert to a neutral stance if the overnight rate dipped to 0.47 percent or below . 
the BOJ conducted an accommodative operation last Friday for the first time since August 7 , 1996 .
