Thai economic growth will slow to 7.16 percent during 1996 while the current account deficit will widen to 8.2 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the top Thai bank said on Tuesday . 
the Thai economy grew by 8.6 percent in 1995 and the current account deficit was 8.1 percent of GDP . 
executive vice-president of Bangkok Bank plc , Nimit Nontapunthawat , told an economic seminar that 1996 would be a watershed year for the Thai economy . 
&quot; 1996 has been a year of realisation for Thailand , a realisation there is something wrong , a realisation we made mistakes . 
I &apos;d like to call it the year when things went wrong , &quot; he said . 
Nimit said export growth would decline to 5.66 percent from 23.6 percent last year , import growth to 7.02 percent versus 30.5 percent , and inflation would increase to 6.06 percent from 5.8 percent . 
he said slowing growth rates reflected a structural shift in the economy away from low cost manufacturing . 
he said any new government expected after a November general election , faced a stern challenge solving economic problems . 
he said investment in labour skilling and education were vital if Thailand &apos;s competitiveness was not to decline further . 
a reduction in domestic consumption and a compulsory savings scheme may have to be introduced to tackle the current account deficit , he said . 
Nimit said a slight easing of this year &apos;s disruptive monetary policy was now needed along with more decisive macro-economic management and increased political stability . 
Nimit said Thailand should also reduce its exposure to foreign capital not linked directly with export production or import substitution . 
Nimit said he was modestly optimistic 1997 would see an improvement in growth and he expects the current account deficit , a persistent worry to foreign investors , to increase . 
GDP is forecasted to grow 7.76 percent in 1997 but the current account deficit is also expected to widen to 8.3 percent of GDP . 
export growth will accelerate by 11.81 percent . 
he said inflation in 1997 is expected to decline to 4.93 percent .
