wall Street shares are expected to open steady to firmer on Wednesday , amid a lower interest rate environment and growing optimism that a new government plan to cut taxes would benefit stocks long-term . 
but analysts said markets would continue to scrutinize a stream of economic data due out this week , including June new home sales data due today at 1000 EDT / 1400 GMT and the key July employment report , due on Friday . 
&quot; There is some residual benefit from the tax bill , given all the stories which have come out about how it will benefit stocks , &quot; Larry Wachtel , an analyst at prudential Securities , said . 
&quot; Plus bonds have been strong . 
stocks were still digesting news that late Monday , President Clinton and Congress negotiated tax cut proposals as part of an agreement to balance the federal budget . 
tax cuts were estimated to amount to more than $ 90 billion over five years .
