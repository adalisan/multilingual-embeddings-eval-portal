a steep rise in the benchmark March Japanese government bond ( JGB ) contract on SIMEX lifted Euroyen futures out of the doldrums on Monday amid vague rumours about financial troubles at a Japanese bank , dealers said . 
March JGBs hit an early high of 126.70 on speculative buying by U.S. houses on SIMEX after closing the Tokyo morning session at 126.38 . 
&quot; They were trying to work a stop at 126.41 . 
a local got wind of it and they paid all the way to 126.65 , &quot; said a trader with a European futures house . 
the contract then extended its gains when the market reopened in Tokyo , trading to a high of 126.85 at one point in the day . 
it settled at 126.65 against its opening 126.13 . 
&quot; technically , the moment it broke 126.36 , it was already considered a buy signal , &quot; said a trader with an Asian house . 
dealers said the contract appeared on track for a target of 127.00 and , potentially , 128.00 . 
Euroyen futures , which have been caught in a dull range in recent weeks , also received a slight boost from the JGB rally . 
&quot; If not for the JGBs , people would have been cautious about buying the Euroyen here , &quot; said the trader with the Asian house , adding that players had bought December Euroyen on the back of the JGB move . 
September was at 99.35 against 99.33 . 
news that Moody &apos;s Investors Service had downgraded four Japanese banks and rumours that Mitsubishi Trust Banking Corp had suffered major losses in derivatives trading also underpinned the market , dealers said . 
Mitsubishi Trust later denied the rumours . 
dealers said the market showed little reaction to news a Japanese hotel chain operator , Hokke Club KK , had applied for court protection to reorganise its financial affairs . 
the group said it had debts of 22.6 billion yen . 
&quot; Any new outbreak of problems at small firms in Japan is quite common now , &quot; said the trader at the Asian house , adding however , that such news supported expectations Japan would maintain its low-interest rate regime . 
Eurodollar futures ended slightly lower in thin trade , with the June contract at 94.17 against its IMM close at 94.18 . 
dealers said players would keep a close watch on the U.S. fourth quarter Employment Cost Index ( ECI ) , due on Tuesday , for an indication of potential wage pressures .
