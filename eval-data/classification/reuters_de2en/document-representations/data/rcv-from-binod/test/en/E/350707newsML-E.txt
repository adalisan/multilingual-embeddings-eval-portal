Zambia is banking on resumed aid to balance its budget in 1997 , but Western governments say they have made no commitments to resume aid after big cuts in 1996 . 
finance Minister Ronald Penza said in his budget speech on Friday that foreign aid would account for one third of the 1,489.1 billion kwacha ( $ 1.15 billion ) budget , providing 358.9 billion kwacha in project aid and a further 130 billion kwacha in non-project support . 
Penza said the government would resume dialogue with Western governments in a bid to persuade them to restart aid flows cut last year after President Frederick Chiluba used constitutional amendments to bar his main political opponents from participating in national elections . 
Chiluba later won the election in a landslide . 
but Western diplomats said on Monday their governments had not committed themselves to funding the budget . 
&quot; Affairs are still a bit unsettled following the holding of elections last November , and we can &apos;t say whether normal aid flows will be restored until we start dialogue with the Zambian government . 
we have not started dialogue yet , &quot; Germany &apos;s ambassador to Zambia Peter Schmidt told Reuters . 
Schmidt said the Consulative Group meeting at which donors were expected to make aid pledges for 1997 , scheduled for February , would be deferred . 
&quot; The Consultative Group meeting will not take place soon . 
before dialogue ( between the donors and the Zambian government ) starts , the meeting would not be useful , &quot; he said . 
the United States embassy in Lusaka declined to say whether it would help fund the budget . 
&quot; We do not have any reaction , &quot; embassy spokesman James Welch said , adding : &quot; The embassy has no comment on the budget &quot; . 
local analysts said a budget without donor commitments would be impossible to fulfil . 
&quot; While the government will be stepping up its own efforts to mobilise additional resources .... we will need further balance of payments support , project financing and external debt relief , &quot; economist Robert Sanyikosa said . 
the government says it will require around $ 200 million in balance of payments support and $ 275 million in project financing in 1997 . 
former minister and opposition leader Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika said the budget was an attempt to hoodwink Zambians into thinking all was well when the country was on the verge of crisis . 
&quot; The ( finance ) minister in his speech did not make it clear to the Zambian people that no donor pledges have been made as yet , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It must also be noted that the failure of the government to address political issues attached to donor support was deliberate . 
it would rather stay in power than serve the Zambian people , &quot; he added . 
opposition leaders , including former president Kenneth Kaunda , are pushing for economic sanctions against Zambia to force the Chiluba government to its knees . 
they have predicted that the resultant economic and social strife would make the country ungovernable in six months .
