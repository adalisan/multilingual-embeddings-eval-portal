more than 250 people were arrested on Friday after a huge San Francisco bicycle rally took an ugly turn , with some riders clashing with police and motorists . 
&quot; It totally got out of hand , &quot; San Francisco Police Officer Mary Heffernan said . 
a route through the city was mapped out for the estimated 6,000 riders who took part in the rally , held on the last Friday of each month to promote bicycles as an alternative to cars . 
police planned to escort the riders along the designated route , to keep car traffic away and to let the bicyclists pass through red lights much like a parade . 
however , thousands of bicyclists veered off the planned route onto busy streets , bringing traffic across San Francisco to a standstill . 
police arrested at least 250 of the riders . 
two police officers were injured , and at least two fights broke out between bike riders and motorists , officials said . 
one officer described the rally as a &quot; madhouse . 
when they started five years ago , the bike rallies were mellower affairs , drawing San Francisco bicycle messengers and some activists . 
in recent years , they have become increasingly popular . 
they now attract thousands of riders each month from across California . 
the cyclists were asked this month to follow a single course , which was agreed upon in advance by ride leaders , San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and the police department . 
for their cooperation , Brown offered to convene an &quot; alternative transportation summit &quot; that would be held in the city within two months . 
&quot; They ( the bikers ) agreed to stay on a certain path , &quot; said Officer Tim Brophy . 
&quot; Instead , the majority of bike riders deviated from that plan ... causing havoc .
