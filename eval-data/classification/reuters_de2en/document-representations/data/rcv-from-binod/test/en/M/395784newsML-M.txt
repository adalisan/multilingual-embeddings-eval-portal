state-owned Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) was expected to buy at least 700,000 tonnes of 1.0-percent sulphur gas oil for delivery in April , traders said on Friday . 
but some traders said IOC might buy more as April is the first month of India &apos;s 1997 / 98 financial year . 
India &apos;s port conditions were also satisfactory compared with past months with no huge volumes of vessels waiting to unload , which could allow for more awards , they said . 
traders said India would also take note of current low fixed price levels in the region as the market enters a low demand period . 
they said if IOC limited its purchases to 700,000 tonnes , it would have a neutral impact on the market , but if the award exceeded that volume , the effect would be bullish . 
they said offers made into the tender were also more aggressive than in the past few months . 
offers to the Indian west coast ranged between $ 1.40 and $ 1.96 per barrel above MidEast spot quotes , cost-and-freight ( c-and-f ) . 
East coast offers ranged between $ 2.00 and $ 2.80 per barrel above MidEast spot quotes , c-and-f . other offers to the east coast ranged between $ 22.77 and $ 32.00 a tonne above the mean of Mediterranean quotes . 
traders said a U.S. major oil company offered about four cargoes at low levels of $ 1.40 a barrel premium to MidEast quotes c-and-f west coast , and $ 23.00- $ 24.00 a tonne above Mediterranean quotes , c-and-f east coast . 
a MidEast oil company offered around 35-40 cents per barrel above MidEast spot quotes , free-on-board ( fob ) basis . 
other aggressive offers were from a Swiss trader and a European major oil company . 
the Swiss trader offered west coast cargoes at $ 1.70- $ 1.90 a barrel above MidEast spot quotes , c-and-f , and east coast cargoes at $ 2.00- $ 2.30 premium to MidEast quotes , c-and-f . 
the European major offered west coast cargoes for the first two weeks in April at $ 1.60- $ 1.70 a barrel above MidEast quotes , c-and-f , east cost cargoes at $ 2.40 premium to MidEast quotes for early April and $ 2.80 premium for the latter half . 
the major also offered Mediterranean-related cargoes at $ 25.50 a tonne premium c-and-f the west coast , and $ 32.00 a tonne premium , c-and-f east coast . 
the tender closed on Thursday and was due to be awarded later on Friday . 
in three tenders for March deliveries , India bought 575,000 tonnes of 1.0-percent sulphur gas oil , 90,000 tonnes of the 0.5-percent grade and 45,000 tonnes of the 0.25-percent grade .
