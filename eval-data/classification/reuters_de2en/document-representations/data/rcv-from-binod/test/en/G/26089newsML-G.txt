Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was quoted on Saturday as saying Israel was leading an attack on peace by expanding settlements on the West bank but predicted a Palestinian state would soon be a reality . 
&quot; You can &apos;t roll an avalanche back up the mountain , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The independent state of Palestine will soon be born , and Arab Jerusalem will be our capital , whether the enemies of peace like it or not , &quot; he told the German news weekly Der Spiegel , according to an advance release from Monday &apos;s edition . 
Arafat has been trying in recent days to put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to honour peace deal commitments , accusing Israel of declaring war on Palestinians with its decision to expand West Bank Jewish settlements . 
&quot; The struggle for peace goes on , there is no alternative , &quot; Arafat told Der Spiegel . 
&quot; We cannot allow ourselves even to consider failure . 
asked if he doubted Netanyahu &apos;s good will , Arafat replied : 
&quot; The construction and expansion of Jewish settlements are an attack on the peace process , led by the Israeli government . 
&quot; Someone who , at this time of all times , presses on with a population displacement in the occupied territories to the advantage of illegal Jewish settlers can hardly let himself be praised as an apostle of peace . 
but Arafat added : &quot; I would be a bad negotiator if I ruled out the possibility of reaching a solution together with Netanyahu to the great problems which stand in the way of peace .
