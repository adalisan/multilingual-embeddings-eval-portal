Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov left for Saudi Arabia on Saturday to take part in the Haj , traditional Moslem pilgrimage . 
Maskhadov , elected in January as the president of the north Caucasus region which seeks independence from Russia , is expected to spend a week in the holy towns of Mecca and Medina . 
Chechen officials have given no idea about whether Maskhadov would have any official meetings there . 
some Chechen officials have suggested that he was planning to meet leaders of some Islamic countries also on pilgrimage . 
Chechen rebels have succesfully resisted almost two years of Russian military onslaught launched in December 1994 to subdue the region &apos;s independence drive . 
Russia and the separatists struck a peace deal in August 1996 under which Moscow withdrew its forces from the region while the rebel leaders promised to put off until 2001 any decision on the thorny issue of Chechnya &apos;s future political status . 
Russia and Chechnya are conducting uneasy talks about a more lasting peace deal which would clarify their relations for the next five years .
