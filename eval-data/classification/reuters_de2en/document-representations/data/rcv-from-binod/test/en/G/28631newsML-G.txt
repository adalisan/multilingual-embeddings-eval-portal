Hungarian opponents of a friendship treaty with Romania said on Tuesday that signing it would be an act of &quot; treason &quot; , but Prime Minister Gyula Horn said it would be approved anyway . 
&quot; ( The signing of this treaty ) amounts to treason , &quot; said Jozsef Torgyan , the outspoken head of the opposition party smallholders . 
Torgyan was speaking at a stormy emergency session of Hungary &apos;s parliament called by the opposition in a last-ditch effort to scuttle the treaty which Romania and Hungary agreed last month but which has yet to be formally ratified . 
after listening for several hours , Prime Minister Gyula Horn said , &quot; So far , I have heard nothing that would make me change my mind . 
Horn &apos;s Hungarian Socialist Party and the Free Democrat coalition partner have a commanding 72 percent majority in Parliament which is more than enough to ratify the treaty . 
Hungary and Romania announced two weeks ago that the friendship treaty , four years in the making , had been completed and was ready to be signed . 
it enshrines protective rights for ethnic minorities and renounces any claims by either country over the other &apos;s territory . 
the opposition says the treaty addresses only rights of individuals and not the collective rights of the 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians living in Romania . 
most analysts agree that the treaty has been completed as a prerequisite of both countries &apos; aspirations for NATO and European Union membership . 
however , some opposition politicians questioned the validity of this argument . 
&quot; If they want us to join NATO and the EU they will accept us regardless of the basic treaty , &quot; said Viktor Orban , leader of FIDESZ-MPP .
