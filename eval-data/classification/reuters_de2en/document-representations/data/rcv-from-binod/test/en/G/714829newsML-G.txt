hundreds of foreigners scrambled aboard Thai military aircraft on Tuesday to flee Cambodia &apos;s capital Phnom Penh , but scores were trapped in the country &apos;s main tourist town by fighting in the north and northwest . 
Phnom Penh , scene of weekend fighting between forces loyal to the country &apos;s co-premiers which claimed at least 58 lives , was quiet . 
but markets , shops and offices remained closed after a night broken by bursts of apparently random rifle fire . 
fighting between forces backing Second Prime Minister Hun Sen , who now controls Phnom Penh , and troops loyal to First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh broke out overnight near the northern town of Siem Reap , home to the fabled Angkor Wat temple complex , a western source in the town said . 
local officials in the northwest of the country said there were also clashes near Sisophon , close to the Thai border . 
police in the southern port city of Sihanoukville said rival forces were confronting each other there . 
the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) on Tuesday called for an immediate ceasefire , declaring it was &quot; dismayed by and deeply regrets the unfortunate turn of events in Cambodia , resulting in the loss of innocent lives , both of Cambodian citizens and of foreigners &quot; . 
Cambodia , along with Burma and Laos , was scheduled to join the seven-member ASEAN later this month , but the collapse of the troubled coalition headed by Ranariddh and Hun Sen has thrown this in doubt . 
ASEAN foreign ministers plan a special meeting on Thursday in Kuala Lumpur to discuss the situation . 
some 300 foreigners , most of them Thai , were evacuated from Phnom Penh on three Thai Air Force transport planes on Tuesday morning and a similar number were set to leave when the aircraft made return flights later in the day . 
those who alighted from the first plane when it returned to Bangkok were seen wearing yellow ribbons on their wrists as identification tags . 
the western source in Siem Reap said fighting nearby forced cancellation of plans for a convoy on Tuesday to evacuate scores of tourists , as well as many aid workers , to the Thai border , 150 km ( 90 miles ) to the west . 
&quot; There &apos;s fighting outside of the city and a lot of troop movements , &quot; the source in Siem Reap said . 
he said there was fighting on the road between the town and the Thai border and land mines had been planted on it . 
Siem Reap itself was quiet on Tuesday morning after the overnight fighting , which occurred when forces loyal to Ranariddh were withdrawing from Siem Reap to join comrades nearby . 
&quot; Last night the remaining FUNCINPEC forces were able to extricate themselves from the town after a two-day standoff , &quot; the western source said , referring to Ranariddh &apos;s men . 
five soldiers loyal to Hun Sen were wounded in the fighting , he said , citing a military official loyal to the Second Prime Minister . 
Siem Reap town was under the control of Hun Sen forces , while large areas of the surrounding countryside were held by Ranariddh troops . 
Hun Sen &apos;s forces have long outnumbered those under Ranariddh in Phnom Penh and in the east . 
the First Prime Minister &apos;s forces have greater strength in the north and northwest of the country . 
Khmer Rouge guerrillas , with whom Ranariddh was negotiating peace before the fighting erupted , control remote countryside in the far north while a powerful faction of Khmer Rouge defectors controls territory along the Thai border in the west . 
the Phnom Penh fighting began on Saturday after Hun Sen &apos;s troops moved against Ranariddh &apos;s men . 
Hun Sen said he had to take action as Ranariddh , who left Cambodia on the eve of the fighting for Paris , was trying to smuggle Khmer Rouge defectors into the city to boost his troop strength . 
parts of Phnom Penh were engulfed in the fighting at the weekend before Ranariddh &apos;s men fled , leaving Hun Sen in control . 
Hun Sen announced in a Sunday night radio broadcast that the prince , son of King Norodom Sihanouk who is now in Beijing , was no longer First Prime Minister . 
Ranariddh denounced the move as a coup and told reporters in France he was organising resistance . 
officials loyal to Hun Sen said in Phnom Penh on Tuesday that a powerful Ranariddh loyalist , Ho Sok , a secretary of state in the Interior Ministry , had been arrested the previous day . 
one political source said he feared a Roundup of officials from Ranariddh &apos;s FUNCINPEC party was imminent . 
there were still no official casualty figures from the two days of fighting and a subsequent day of looting and random violence in the capital . 
a police source said preliminary investigation showed there were 58 deaths , both combatants and civilians , and as many as 200 wounded in the violence . 
Phnom Penh hospital sources said most casualties were civilians caught in crossfire and one city centre hospital said it was caring for 77 wounded .
