recently volatile trade and bouncing interest rates on Venezuela &apos;s overnight interbank lending market is a passing phase that holds no systemic risk for the country &apos;s banks , banking superintendent Francisco Debera said . 
although weekly turnover on the once-dormant market now tops 300 billion bolivars ( $ 600 million ) , and rates have yo-yoed between five and 90 percent since late May , recent tightness &quot; has presented no risks to the system , at least in what we have investigated so far , &quot; Debera told reporters . 
Debera said four or five banks had been forced to draw on their required reserves deposited with the Central Bank , &quot; but they in no way faced any kind of solvency problem , &quot; Debera said . 
Venezuela &apos;s banks are still rebuilding their strength after half the system tanked in the 1994-5 banking crisis that absorbed around $ 11 billion in state bailouts . 
Debera said large issues of Central Bank TEM paper , used to mop up liquidity in the financial system , combined with sluggish government payments to certain banks were partly responsible for the volatility . 
traders add that sharp banking and aggressive new trading strategies by recently privatized state banks that previously sat on spare cash have also increased volatility .
