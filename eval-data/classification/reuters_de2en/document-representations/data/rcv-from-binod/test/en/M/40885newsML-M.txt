Zimbabwe &apos;s share market traded predictably stronger on Monday as a number of bullish factors continued to boost the market , brokers said . 
they said both local and foreign investors were still excited by the prospects of lower interest rates and by an increase in the level of foreign shareholding on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange ( ZSE ) . 
&quot; The market is keeping a clear focus on the good news , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; And the consensus is that this will keep the ( bullish ) trend on for quite a while , &quot; he said adding that more foreign players were expected to participate in coming weeks . 
the ZSE &apos;s three-week bull-run gained impetus last week when the central Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe raised to 40 percent from 35 percent the amount of equity foreigners were allowed to buy in a Zimbabwean company . 
gains were recorded in Zimbabwe Newspapers which traded 25 cents higher at 1,275 , winer makers Afdis , which was up 30 cents at 340 , and timber producer Border , which traded 80 cents higher at 1,380 .
