national Basketball Association Commissioner David Stern Thursday fined Chicago bulls bad boy Dennis Rodman $ 50,000 for recent obscenity-laced comments Rodman made about Mormons during the NBA finals . 
&quot; I have indicated in previous actions that insensitive or derogatory comments involving race or other classifications are unacceptable in the NBA , &quot; Stern said in a statement issued by the league . 
&quot; Dennis Rodman &apos;s comments were exactly the kind of offensive remarks that cannot be tolerated or excused , &quot; Stern said . 
the league did not go so far as to suspend the NBA rebounding champion , who will be available to play for Chicago in Game 6 of the finals on Friday . 
the defending champion bulls lead the Utah Jazz three games to two in the best-of-seven championship series . 
Rodman , in a bizarre excuse for his poor play in the finals following Game 3 , said last Saturday that he could not get his game in sync because of all the &quot; asshole Mormons &quot; in the state . 
given a chance to explain or retract his offensive comments on Tuesday , Rodman just compounded his problems . 
&quot; The Mormon people here don &apos;t like me either , right ? 
&quot; he said . 
Rodman claimed he was the target of the same expletive as well as obscene gestures when he travelled around Mormon-dominated Utah . 
the Mormon church -- The Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints -- whose members make up about 70 percent of the Utah population , declined comment on the controversy . 
but anti-bigotry groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP have condemned Rodman &apos;s comments . 
during the week that the NBA finals were in Salt Lake City -- for Games 3 , 4 and 5 -- the often-suspended Rodman fled strait-laced Utah to relax in anything-goes Las Vegas in neighbouring Nevada for two nights in a row , saying he &quot; wanted to get the hell out of here and relax . 
Rodman &apos;s unusual lifestyle choices , which includes ever-changing garishly-coloured hair , cross-dressing , body-piercing and gambling , are the polar opposite of Mormon beliefs , which do not allow smoking , swearing or the consumption of alcohol or caffeine .
