the lead prosecutor in the Oklahoma City bombing case denied Thursday defence claims that the government acted improperly in the way it handled information from a key witness . 
&quot; The government lawyers were beyond reproach and the FBI agents were an honourable group , &quot; prosecutor Joseph Hartzler told a pre-trial hearing . 
Hartzler urged U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch not to throw out a portion of the testimony of Thomas Manning , a tire dealer in junction City , Kansas that prosecutors said linked McVeigh to renting the Ryder truck allegedly used in the bombing . 
several days before the bombing Manning sold Timothy McVeigh the 1977 Mercury Marquis he was driving when he was arrested near Perry , Oklahoma 90 minutes after the bombing . 
McVeigh and former army buddy Terry Nichols are charged with bombing the Alfred P. Murray federal building in 1995 that killed 168 people . 
in a sworn deposition Manning testified that McVeigh left the tire store for a short while , during which time the government claimed he called a Ryder truck rental office . 
manning &apos;s deposition was taped because prosecutors said he had a life-threatening heart condition . 
defence lawyers want the testimony about McVeigh leaving the store suppressed because Manning did not mention it for 18 months , despite a series of interviews with prosecutors . 
McVeigh &apos;s attorney Robert nigh argued that prosecutors either improperly suggested to Manning &quot; what his testimony should be &quot; or that the government &apos;s earlier questioning of Manning &quot; was extremely shoddy . 
defence lawyers want Manning &apos;s testimony thrown because of the prosecutors &apos; alleged failure to inform them of Manning &apos;s supposedly inconsistent statements . 
but prosecutors contend Manning &apos;s statements were not inconsistent because he had never been asked specifically whether McVeigh left the store briefly . 
Matsch said he would decide later whether to suppress Manning &apos;s testimony . 
McVeigh &apos;s trial begins March 31 . 
Nichols will be tried later at an undetermined date .
