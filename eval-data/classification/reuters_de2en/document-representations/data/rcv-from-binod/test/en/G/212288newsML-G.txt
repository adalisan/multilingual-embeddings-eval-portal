a Russian-brokered deal to defuse the conflict between Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko and his parliament collapsed in less than 24 hours on Saturday after legislators failed to approve it . 
Lukashenko , speaking on television , announced he was withdrawing from his side of the deal and said a controversial referendum on Sunday on increasing his powers would be mandatory . 
the deal &apos;s collapse was a serious loss of face for Russia whose Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin brokered it in all-night talks between Thursday and Friday . 
Lukashenko had agreed that the referendum should only be consultative while his opposition promised to withdraw an attempt to remove him from office . 
&quot; The referendum will have a mandatory character . 
I declare this directly since the parliament nor the constitutional court has fulfilled the obligations which they took on , &quot; Lukashenko said , ruling out any further attempts at compromise . 
he said parliament &apos;s failure to pass the deal showed disrespect to all the other parties involved , including the Russian leadership , which hailed the accord as a great success for its diplomacy and for the &quot; community &quot; it formed with Belarus last April . 
Deputy speaker of parliament Gennady Karpenko said he had not seen Lukashenko &apos;s early morning broadcast but commented : 
&quot; We have a constitutional court decision that the referendum should be consultative . 
Parliament in a series of votes late on Friday defied pressure from Lukashenko , who came twice to the chamber , and failed to muster even a simple majority of the 199 members in favour of the deal , which many deputies saw as tilted in the president &apos;s favour . 
Lukashenko wants to use the referendum to tighten his grip on rival institutions and extend his term by more than two years -- an idea fiercely opposed by parliament . 
the constitutional court has repeatedly ruled that Lukashensko has exceeded his powers . 
Parliament has adjourned until Tuesday . 
but it now faces the risk that Lukashenko will either ignore it altogether or order it dissolved if voters , as expected , approve his constitutional draft . 
the row has many parallels with the crisis which paralysed politics in Russia for most of 1993 and ended in bloodshed when President Boris Yeltsin put down an armed revolt led by his parliamentary opponents . 
Lukashenko , Parliament Chairman Semyon Sharetsky and Chernomyrdin signed an agreement at dawn on Friday after all-night talks to defuse the conflict . 
under the Russian deal , the future of the constitution would be handed over to a commission composed of 50 members from parliament and 50 named by Lukashenko -- in effect giving the president a built-in majority because some deputies are on his side . 
Western officials and his opponents have observed serious flaws in early voting which began almost two weeks ago on November 9 .
