a landmark $ 195 million syndicated loan for the City of Bogota has won an International Financing Review ( IFR ) award for the best such financing in Latin America , the city &apos;s mayor said in a statement released in London . 
&quot; The International Financing Review ... has just granted the City of Santa Fe de Bogota , capital of Colombia , its acknowledgement as the best ( such ) negotiation of the year 1996 , &quot; the statement said . 
the IFR is due to formally present the award for &quot; Best Latin American Loan of the Year &quot; later on Thursday . 
the five-year loan , the first syndicated loan for a Latin American city , was arranged by ING Barings ( U.S. ) Securities and J.P. Morgan Securities . 
launched in New York in November , it was priced at 175 basis points over three-month Libor . 
it was increased to $ 195 million after an initial projection of $ 150 million , and was assigned a BBB rating by Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s . 
the proceeds are earmarked for financing infrastructure and social projects until 1998 , and to initiate the planning of other projects until 2020 , the statement said . 
&quot; Having the municipality rated , and investment grade at that , was key to making banks comfortable with joining the syndicated loan , &quot; it said in an article seen by Reuters ahead of publication . 
it also highlighted the loan &apos;s innovative structure since it uses the city &apos;s tax revenues as security -- a structure rarely seen among international syndicated loans .
