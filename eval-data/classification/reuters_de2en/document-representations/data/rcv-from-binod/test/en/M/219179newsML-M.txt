Australian shares closed weaker on Tuesday , a promising early rise eroded by lunch as sellers , worried about the effect of the stronger Australian dollar on the resource sector , took control of the market . 
the market barometer , the All Ordinaries index ended 12.7 points weaker at 2,382 , after touching a life-high of 2408.9 in the morning session . 
turnover was high and dealers said the rapid change of sentiment after lunch fed trading activity late in the session . 
&quot; Our dollar rate is concerning some people certainly , I think that has a lot to do with it , &quot; said Geoff Burrell , a director of Brisbane brokerage , Burrell and Co . 
Burrell said investors were concerned about the growth rate of the Australian economy , the future direction of interest rates and the release of the first part of the Wallis inquiry into Australia &apos;s finance sector on Thursday . 
&quot; Part of the Wallis announcement comes out on Thursday which is pushing people &apos;s thoughts about the banking sector which is really where the growth has been , &quot; Burrell said . 
despite these concerns the bank sector was one of the best performing segments of the market on Tuesday . 
by contrast the resources sector fell more than one percent with leading resource issues BHP and CRA , the main targets for sellers . 
one of the weakest stocks on the day was beverage and food group Coca-Cola Amatil whose shares slid more than five percent on heavy volume . 
&quot; Coca-Cola Amatil has been overpriced for some time . 
on those sorts of price earnings ratios on our figures for next year they are still trading at nearly 50 times earnings , &quot; Burrell said .
