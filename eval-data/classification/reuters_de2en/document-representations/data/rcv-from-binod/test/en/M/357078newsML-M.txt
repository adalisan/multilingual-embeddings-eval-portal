renewed worries about Japan &apos;s banking sector lifted SIMEX Euroyen futures to new contract highs as they reaffirmed confidence in a continued low interest rate environment , dealers said on Wednesday . 
early rumours about Nippon Credit Bank &apos;s financial health triggered a sell-off in banking shares and boosted Japanese interest rate and government bond ( JGB ) futures . 
but dealers said gains were dampened by Nippon Credit &apos;s denial of the rumours and the dollar &apos;s surge to a four-year high of 123.18 yen . 
the bank said it would dispose of 130 billion yen-worth of problem loans in the 1996 / 97 fiscal year but added that it had no liquidity problems . 
&quot; The worries are not just centering on Nippon Credit . 
it &apos;s the banking sector as a whole , &quot; said a trader with a European futures house , citing Moody &apos;s investor Service &apos;s recent downgrading of four Japanese banks . 
&quot; The overall view in the market is that Japan will keep interest rates low due to the strong dollar and the fact that the bad debt problems are not solved yet . 
so there &apos;s no reason to sell Euroyen now , &quot; said a dealer with a local futures house . 
he said December Euroyen could head for 99.28 next week while September could test 99.43 . 
December was similarly at 99.24 against a high of 99.25 . 
March JGBs settled at 126.33 against their opening 126.22 . 
a Japanese bank dealer said September Euroyen needed to break out of a 99.32-99.38 band to stem its sideways trend . 
Eurodollar futures finished unchanged as players awaited the outcome of a two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting , at which most analysts expect U.S. rates to be held steady .
