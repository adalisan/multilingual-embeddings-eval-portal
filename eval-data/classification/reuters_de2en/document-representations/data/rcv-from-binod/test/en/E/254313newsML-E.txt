the World Bank ( WB ) has criticised Slovakia &apos;s planned budget deficit for 1997 , instead recommending continuation of balanced fiscal policy to ensure further economic growth , the daily Pravda reported on Friday . 
the paper quotes a WB report on Slovakia as saying that after 1996 &apos;s planned balanced budget for the public sector , which includes the state budget and social funds , next year &apos;s fiscal deficit is expected to total slightly under 20 billion crowns , or three percent of the planned GDP . 
&quot; The World Bank considers this as a radical worsening of the development ( of the budget ) , &quot; the report said . 
last Friday , the Slovak parliament passed a 1997 state budget with a planned deficit of 36.9 billion crowns , up from the expected overall deficit of 27 billion this year . 
the Finance Ministry has , however , said that according to International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) standards , the fiscal deficit should be some 11.7 billion crowns , or 1.8 percent of the forecasted GDP . 
finance ministry officials were not immediately available for comment on the report . 
earlier this month , the central bank said that according to its methodology , the 1997 fiscal deficit should total some 24.7 billion next year , and warned this could threaten the internal and external stability of the crown . 
the World Bank also warned that a large fiscal deficit can cause problems in the monetary sphere . 
the central bank said that it , unlike the finance ministry , included planned bond issues and loans for planned government projects in the deficit . 
the Slovak government plans to launch a total of eight billion crowns worth of bonds next year . 
the NBS said the budget is expected to have a fiscal surplus of some 2.5 billion crowns this year , but expected the 1997 fiscal deficit to account for 3.7 percent of the GDP . 
it said that at least half of the deficit should be covered by direct foreign investnment and not only by the continuation of widening the state debt .
