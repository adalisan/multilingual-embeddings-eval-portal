following are some of the main factors affecting Indian stock markets on Thursday morning : 
* * The Indian parliament will debate a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda &apos;s government on Friday , lower house speaker Purno Sangma said . 
&quot; There is a no-confidence motion . 
we will take it up on 
the 21st ( of February ) , &quot; he told reporters on Thursday . 
the motion has been moved by George Fernandes of the 
Socialist Samta Party , a breakaway group of DEVE Gowda &apos;s Janata Dal party , politicians said . 
the Samta Party has an alliance with the main opposition 
rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) in the eastern state of Bihar . 
the BJP , which with its allies has 194 votes in the 545-seat lower house , said it will back the motion . 
* * The government is set to withdraw the surcharge on corporate income tax in the budget to be presented on February 28 , the Business Standard quoted government officials as saying . 
they added it was possible that the corporate tax rate 
would also be cut from 40 to 35 percent . 
domestic companies at present were liable to pay income tax at the rate of 40 percent . 
those with an annual income of 75,000 rupees were also liable to pay a surcharge of 7.5 percent on the income tax payable by them , the business daily said . 
* * India will overshoot its 1996 / 97 fiscal deficit target of five percent of gross domestic product and economists said on Wednesday the government needs new revenue streams in next year &apos;s budget to stem the red ink . 
broadening the tax base is high on the agenda for 
finance Minister P.Chidambaram , who presents India &apos;s budget for 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) on February 28 . 
Chidambaram wants to lower the fiscal deficit to four 
but working in a 13-party coalition ranging from 
moderates , through regional parties to communists , limits the finance minister &apos;s options for raising extra cash . 
* * The Indian rupee opened at 35.89 / 90 against the dollar on Thursday , little changed from Wednesday &apos;s closing quote of 35.88 / 89 , dealers said . 
Thursday &apos;s range is seen at 35.89 / 91 rupees to a dollar , they said . 
* * Indian blue chips rallied smartly from intra-day lows on Wednesday in a roller coaster ride marked by heavy speculative action in select stocks , dealers said . 
* * The benchmark index of the Bombay Stock Exchange rallied 59.55 points , or 1.7 percent , from the day &apos;s low of 3,468.89 to end at 3,528.44 . 
it suffered a net loss of 1.79 points over the previous close . 
* * The 50-stock National Stock Exchange index gained 11.10 points , or 1.10 percent , to 1,011.85 .
