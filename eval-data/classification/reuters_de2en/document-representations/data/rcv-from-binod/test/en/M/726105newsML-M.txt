cash protection of five cents per bushel was applied to corn and 15 cents to soybeans at Midwest grain markets in reaction to reports central Illinois received at least one inch of rain on Monday , grain dealers said . 
the protection was widespread , and had essentially halted corn and soybean movement , dealers said . 
grain and weather sources said about an inch of rain fell in Decatur and Champaign in central Illinois , but little fell elsewhere in that region . 
&quot; It didn &apos;t rain at Peoria or Springfield today , &quot; said Peter Leavitt , CEO of weather Services Inc . 
Leavitt said the fast moving storm system produced 0.5 inch in rain in Champaign in eight minutes and lingering showers brought the total to 1.1 inch . 
&quot; It is just what we needed , &quot; said one Decatur grain source of the rain . 
a central Illinois area bordered by Peoria , Springfield , Decatur and Champaign has received about one-tenth its normal rainfall the past 30 days which has stressed corn and soybean crops . 
Leavitt said much of the area west of Decatur and Champagne was missed by the rain .
