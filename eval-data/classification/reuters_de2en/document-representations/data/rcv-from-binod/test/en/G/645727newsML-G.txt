Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk on Sunday told the family of a missing British mine clearance expert that his attempts to obtain information on the case from Khmer Rouge rebels had failed . 
Sihanouk expressed his regrets in a letter to Betty Howes , mother of kidnap victim Christopher Howes . 
&quot; I have done my utmost , through several messages addressed to the Khmer Rouge leadership , to obtain a proper answer on the whereabouts of Mr Howes , yet the Khmer Rouge refuse to acknowledge that they captured your son , &quot; Sihanouk wrote . 
&quot; I share your anguish over the disappearance of your esteemed son ... , &quot; said the June 7 letter released by the palace on Sunday . 
the palace later released a May 11 letter to Sihanouk from Betty Howes , in which she appealed to Sihanouk to help find their son and seek justice in the case of a man who played a part in her son &apos;s abduction , who is now free . 
&quot; My family and I are most concerned to learn that cheap Vichit ... who was sentenced to five years imprisonment for his part in leading the kidnappers to the area where my son Christopher and his de-mining team was working , was released from prison early this year after having served only a few months of his ( five-year ) sentence , &quot; Howes wrote . 
&quot; It seems to me that it is extremely unjust that this man should have his freedom whilst my son is still a captive . 
Howes and his interpreter Houn Hourth were abducted on March 26 of last year while conducting mine clearance operations in the northwest province of Siem Reap . 
authorities believe the two men were taken to the Khmer Rouge jungle stronghold of Anlong Veng . 
the Khmer Rouge have denied involvement in the abduction , but Sihanouk said last month he feared the rebels had killed Howes . 
Betty Howes said that cheap Vichit should not have been freed under a general amnesty to the Khmer Rouge if , as he claimed in court , he was not a member of the rebel movement . 
in his reply , Sihanouk said he would convey the family &apos;s concerns to co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen. 
the Howes family has issued several public appeals for information . 
in April , the British newspaper the Mail on Sunday reported that an employee of Howes &apos;s organisation , the British-based Mines Advisory Group ( MAG ) , had paid $ 120,000 in ransom last November in the hope of securing Howes &apos;s release . 
but Howes never appeared and $ 40,000 of the ransom money was returned , the report said . 
hopes were also raised and dashed late last November when a top Cambodian general said Howes , Houn Hourth and a group of Khmer Rouge defectors had escaped from Anlong Veng and were headed for government lines . 
they never appeared . 
an MAG spokesman told Reuters the group had received no reliable information on Howes since the abduction . 
the Khmer Rouge , whose 1975-79 &quot; killing fields &quot; rule left more than one million people dead , have been fighting the coalition government formed in 1993 since reneging on a 1991 peace pact . 
but the rebels , blamed for the abductions and murders of at least seven Westerners since 1993 , have been weakened considerably by mass defections over the past year . 
less than 2,000 hardliners are believed to remain in and around Anlong Veng .
