gunmen killed four people , including a policeman , and injured 17 when they threw grenades and opened fire on customers in a May Day bar brawl in the Ukrainian port of Odessa , interior ministry officials said on Friday . 
police quoted witnesses as saying an argument then a fight had broken out between four men and a woman and others marking the traditional holiday late on Thursday . 
the group left the bar , but the four men returned close to midnight , exploded two hand grenades and opened fire on customers with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a pistol , they said . 
two men in their early 30s , including the policeman , were killed outright . 
two women in their mid-20s died in hospital . 
seventeen others were injured and treated in hospital , police said . 
riot police and rescue workers rushed to the scene after inhabitants of the building raised the alarm when they heard shots from the bar on the ground floor , police said . 
police set up extensive roadblocks but failed to catch the four men , who drove off in a car after the attack , police said . 
&quot; Preliminary investigations suggest this was purely an act of hooliganism rather than a settling of accounts between criminal groups , &quot; one official told Reuters . 
as in Russia and other former Soviet republics , criminal groups have mushroomed in Ukraine since it won independence in 1991 and violent solutions to differences over territory or business deals are common . 
Odessa has been the scene of several such &quot; razborki &quot; or settling of accounts , most recently on April 21 when a leading criminal figure was found dead with 20 bullets in his body . 
the dead man , known as &quot; Karabas , &quot; was thought to have controlled many trading points in Odessa itself and further afield
