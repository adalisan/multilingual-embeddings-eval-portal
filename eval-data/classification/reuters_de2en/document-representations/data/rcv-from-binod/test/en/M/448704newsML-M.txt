the Philippine Central Bank said on Monday it had withdrawn its special series 89-day Treasury bills from the over-the-counter facility . 
the special series one-year bills were maintained with its interest rate at 10.7 percent . 
the Central Bank did not change its overnight and termed reverse repo rates ahead of the weekly Treasury bill auction later today . 
the bank cut its reverse repo rates twice last week , prompting bankers to predict a fall in the bellwether T-bill rate to single-digit level from 10.159 percent last week .
