an Angolan army advance in the country &apos;s north-east shows signs of moving towards a key airfield held by former rebel movement UNITA , military analysts and officials said on Tuesday . 
they said troops were massing near the town of Cafunfo , a government-held city in Western Lunda Norte Province which is close to Lusamba and its large airfield . 
military analysts said government forces ( FAA ) had recently restricted the movement of foreigners around Cafunfo and warned they were in danger because of upcoming UNITA military activities in the area . 
&quot; It is a bad sign . 
it could mean that they ( the FAA ) really will move into the area , &quot; said one analyst . 
officials close to the peace process said the Lusamba airfield has been used as a supply base by UNITA for several years . 
they said the airstrip is not sealed , but is capable of handling large transport planes . 
U.N. sources said the head of the U.N. peacekeeping force , Alioune Blondin Beye , went to UNITA &apos;s stronghold of Bailundo on Tuesday to discuss the crisis with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi . 
&quot; Beye is worried that this is very dangerous to the peace process , &quot; said one official . 
UNITA , the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola , fought a 19-year civil war against the then Marxist government that erupted at independence from Portugal in 1975 . 
the two sides signed a peace agreement in the Zambian capital , Lusaka , in 1994 . 
in April UNITA entered into a power-sharing arrangement with the government , thus fulfilling one of the main goals of the Lusaka accord and of a 6,000-plus U.N. peacekeeping force here . 
although the establishment of the unity government signalled a formal end to hostilities , there are still major problems to be worked out before Angola can have lasting peace , officials close to the peace process and diplomats say . 
chief among them is the handover of UNITA zones -- perhaps up to 70 percent of the country -- to the government . 
since the handover of M &apos;Banza Congo , the capital of Angola &apos;s Zaire Province in the northwest , the process has stalled . 
plans to cede the town Vila Nova , in the central highlands , were delayed last week because of the army advances , said UNITA . 
if not , it threatens to halt the move . 
the current army advance , which has taken several towns in a UNITA-held area near the border with newly renamed Democratic Republic of Congo , is the largest since 1995 , military officials here say . 
one military analyst told Reuters government troops were also gathering to the south-east , near the city of Cacolo . 
residents around the government-held city of Cambulo , to the east of Lusamba , report hearing mortar and rocket fire in recent days . 
aid officials in the border city of Dundo report civilians fleeing from UNITA-held areas into the city at a rate of about 50 a day . 
there are no firm reports of the scale of casualties during the latest fighting and Angolan government and military officials have been unavailable for comment . 
but UNITA has reported dead and wounded civilians , some from artillery fire , and the United Nations reported dead and wounded from the Angolan army .
