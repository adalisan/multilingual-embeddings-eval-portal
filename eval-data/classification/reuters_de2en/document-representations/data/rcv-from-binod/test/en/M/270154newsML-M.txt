French shares closed with a jump of more than one percent in heavy turnover on Friday , tracking the &quot; Santa Claus rally &quot; on Wall Street , traders said . 
&quot; The big push was today before people head for the hills , said a senior equity salesman , referring to departures for the Christmas week holiday . 
people also wanted to trade today as Monday marks the end of the December account . 
the blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 29.83 points or 1.33 percent at 2,278.53 . 
the index was up 3.4 percent on the week . 
the CAC-40 futures contract was up at 2,280 from 2,250 on Thursday &apos;s close . 
&quot; Total turnover in French shares was 12.8 billion francs . 
that is an historic record and exceeds the previous record of 12.289 billion reached on July 30 , 1993 , &quot; an SBF spokesman said . 
total volume , including foreign shares listed in France , was 13.2 billion francs . 
the spokesman said that trading volume was boosted by Roussel-Uclaf , with Germany &apos;s Hoechst making a buy-out bid starting today . 
volume in Roussel alone was 4.7 billion francs on Friday , the SBF added . 
some operators said they were worried about the linkage with New York as they felt that the Paris market was rising too fast and Wall Street needed to consolidate . 
the Dow &apos;s recent volatility has also worried operators here . 
but funds appeared to be underinvested and were looking to place money before the end of the year , to avoid tax payments , the senior equity salesman said . 
if Wall Street continues its climb , investors will continue to seek high-quality stocks , a U.S. broker here said .
