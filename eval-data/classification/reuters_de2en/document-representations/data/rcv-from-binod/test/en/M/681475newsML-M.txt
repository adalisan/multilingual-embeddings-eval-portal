U.S. treasuries were quiet in London on Monday , with little to knock them off newly captured highs , traders said . 
the data agenda this week is light and analysts said the market could drift higher in its currently comfortable environment of low inflation . 
&quot; It &apos;s quarter end , there &apos;s people looking for duration . 
the view is one of the economy slowing down , inflation has been good , there &apos;s nothing to back it up , &quot; a trader at a U.S. bank in London said . 
the benchmark long bond was quoted at 99-16 at 0945 GMT , for a yield of 6.663 percent , unchanged from both Tokyo and the close in New York on Friday . 
September T-bond futures were down 3 / 31 at 112-14 in automated trade . 
on Friday , the yield on the long bond dipped to 6.64 percent , its lowest level since February 21 . 
T-bond futures were aiming for the year &apos;s high of 114-08 on February 18 . 
the trader at the U.S. bank said 114-08 was the next target for the future contract . 
the main focal points for the market this week will be the Conference Board &apos;s June consumer confidence index on Tuesday and the University of Michigan &apos;s final June consumer index on Friday . 
also , the Treasury sells $ 15.5 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday and $ 11.5 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday . 
Dick Howard , senior economist at Bank Julius Baer in London , agreed the market could stretch a little higher . 
&quot; There won &apos;t be much to drive it through the week so perhaps it can add a tick or two but probably not a point or two , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The dollar seems to have done reasonably well out of the G7 summit so that may be a slightly helpful influence . 
the dollar / yen was quoted at 115.29 / 15.39 , off a session high of 115.67 in the wake of the summit in Denver which downplayed Japan &apos;s burgeoning trade surplus . 
but Howard said treasuries would eventually have to tackle the issue of tight labour markets . 
the June purchasing manager and payroll reports next week would likely put pressure on prices . 
&quot; It &apos;s definitely lull before the storm time , &quot; he said .
