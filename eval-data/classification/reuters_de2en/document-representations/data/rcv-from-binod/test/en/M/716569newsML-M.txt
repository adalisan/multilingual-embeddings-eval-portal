U.S. Midwest direct cash hogs Thursday were seen steady to $ 0.50 per cwt lower , pressured by expected lower bids from packers who continue to lose on their margins , livestock dealers said . 
Packer margins remained deep in the red as weak pork prices offset potential benefit from lower cash hog prices this week , the dealers said . 
Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs on Thursday were seen steady to $ 0.50 lower at $ 59.00 to $ 59.50 for hogs delivered to the plant , livestock dealers said .

Indidan / Ohio top prices at the plant were expected off $ 0.50 at $ 59.00 , they said . 
declines in the eastern Corn Belt could steepen on projections for lighter demand amid news that Indiana packers Corp would not slaughter on Friday at its Delphi , Ind . , plant because of scheduled maintenance . 
the plant will resume slaughter on Monday , said Ed Nelson , the company &apos;s vice president . 
about 10,000 to 12,000 hogs are slaughtered each day at the plant , Nelson said .
