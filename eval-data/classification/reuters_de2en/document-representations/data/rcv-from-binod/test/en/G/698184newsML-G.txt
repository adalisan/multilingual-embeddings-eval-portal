defending champion Richard Krajicek was slowly losing his grip on his Wimbledon title when bad light halted Tim Henman &apos;s attempts to scale another memorable Centre Court peak on Tuesday . 
the British 14th seed was within sight of the last eight when the action was stopped , leading the big-serving Dutchman 7-6 6-7 7-6 after twice holding his nerve when tie-break leads seemed to be slipping away . 
German supporters might justly claim that victories by Boris Becker , Michael Stich and teenager Nicolas Kiefer , ensuring three of their countrymen in a grand slam quarter-final for the first time in the Open era , deserved top billing on a shower-interrupted day . 
but Henman &apos;s bravura performance , taking his cue from Greg Rusedski &apos;s straight sets win over American Richey Reneberg , was another marvellous treat for the home crowd whose impossible dreams of a first British winner at Wimbledon since 1936 are in increasing danger of materialising . 
before they do , however , Henman , whose epic third round encounter against another Dutchman Paul Haarhuis went to 14-12 in the fifth set , may have to dig in for another long haul on Wednesday if he is to meet Stich in the last eight . 
it took him five set points to clinch the first set tie-break 9-7 , and he also had one in the second set tie-break after hitting one of the purest backhands of his life down the line when Krajicek held a set point moments earlier . 
this time , though , fortune favoured the champion who finally took it 9-7 with an ace , and despite a break apiece early in the next set , a third tie-break was almost inevitable . 
Henman &apos;s steely temperament as much as anything else saw him through 7-5 , and although Krajicek has so far served 21 aces to Henman &apos;s seven , his serve has yet to match the awesome heights of 12 months ago . 
Becker &apos;s straight sets victory over Chile &apos;s Marcelo Rios and Stich &apos;s earlier four-set win over Mark Woodforde offered a timely reminder that Krajicek is not the only former champion to be reckoned with on the All England Club grass . 
but it was the 19-year-old Kiefer &apos;s stunning 6-2 7-5 2-6 6-1 win over world number three Yevgeny Kafelnikov which qualified as the day &apos;s best completed win , earning the former junior finalist a last eight meeting with Australian Todd Woodbridge . 
only on-court treatment for a lower back problem and a rain delay at 3-1 in the final set threatened to delay the advance of a delighted Kiefer , one of the first two players to be accepted into Becker &apos;s recently-formed junior team in Germany . 
Becker , still nursing ambitions of a fourth Wimbledon singles title , is amused by the possibility of master meeting pupil in the semifinals , having dealt efficiently with the challenge of Chile &apos;s Marcelo Rios . 
he now plays either Pete Sampras or Petr Korda , who also failed to complete their fourth round match . 
Sampras was ahead 6-4 4-2 when dusk fell . 
doubles specialist Woodbridge , meanwhile , earned his first appearance in a grand slam singles quarter-final by defeating compatriot Pat Rafter 6-7 6-4 7-6 6-3 to guarantee at least two unseeded semifinalists . 
either Rusedski or France &apos;s Cedric Pioline will claim a place in the last four , with Rusedski the clear favourite after his straight sets win over American Richey Reneberg . 
the Canadian-reared Rusedski is serving well enough to worry anyone and his 7-6 6-4 7-6 victory was his third straight sets success in four matches . 
but Pioline has a growing reputation at Wimbledon too , having made the last eight for the third time in five years courtesy of a 3-6 6-3 6-4 7-5 win over New Zealander Brett Steven . 
prior to Henman &apos;s arrival , though , the day &apos;s biggest cheer was reserved for Stefan Edberg , given a minute-long standing ovation on Centre Court in recognition of his past contribution to Wimbledon .
