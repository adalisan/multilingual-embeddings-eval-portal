the dollar rose against the Japanese yen and fell versus the German mark on Monday , but trading remained subdued ahead of U.S. presidential and congressional elections on Tuesday , experts said . 
election polls showed Democratic President Bill Clinton will likely win a second term , but the battle for domination of both houses of Congress is considered too close to call . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very docile , quiet day , &quot; said Tom Benfer , director , foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s keeping people on the sidelines from taking big positions , &quot; he added , referring to the elections . 
the dollar ended at 113.80 / 90 yen on Monday , up from 113.12 / 22 yen at the open . 
the U.S. currency fell to 1.5105 / 15 marks from 1.5120 / 30 marks at the open . 
the dollar had sold off against the yen Friday after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen warned a stronger dollar could hurt foreign demand for exported American goods . 
Bentsen served as Treasury Secretary in the first two years of the Clinton administration , during which some on Wall Street believed he favored an informal ceiling on the dollar of around 113 yen . 
by contrast , current Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has repeatedly called for a strong dollar . 
the dollar gained against the yen on Monday , in part , as currency traders reconsidered Bentsen &apos;s remarks and bought back dollars . 
&quot; The dollar is a little stronger against the yen , I think , because it &apos;s recovering from its weakness on Friday from Lloyd Bentsen &apos;s comments ( which were ) seen as possibly suggesting that the Administration was going to change its tone on the dollar ( versus the yen ) after the election , &quot; said Chris Widness , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc . 
&quot; But I think the market is really not buying into that , &quot; Widness said . 
&quot; That &apos;s why the dollar is coming back today . 
the yen also weakened versus other major currencies , including the mark . 
the Bank of Japan has kept official rates at rockbottom levels to help boost economic growth in Japan . 
currency traders cited solid demand to buy marks and sell yen , which also pushed the dollar lower versus the German currency . 
&quot; There &apos;s been a lot of demand for marks for yen today and the demand to buy Deutschemarks has weighed on the dollar ( against the mark ) and kept dollar versus yen up as well , &quot; said William Marr , manager of foreign exchange at Credit Commerciale de France . 
the British pound climbed against most leading currencies on Monday , including the dollar , the mark and the yen . 
the global telecommunications powerhouse will be called Concert plc . 
Widness said sterling sold off over the weekend , in part , due to the announcement because some market players thought it would create demand for dollars in Britain . 
but , he said it is too early for that because there are going to be regulatory discussions underway . 
the British pound soared on Monday to $ 1.6470 , a fresh 20-month high . 
however , the pound closed at $ 1.6442 / 52 , up from $ 1.6382 / 87 at the open . 
the dollar fell to 1.2668 / 78 Swiss francs from 1.2680 / 85 francs , but rose to Canadian $ 1.3359 / 64 from C $ 1.3350 / 55 . 
the Australian dollar finished at $ 0.7875 / 80 , up from $ 0.7866 / 71 at the open .
