Arab opponents of contacts with Israel on Monday quietly celebrated the victory of their policy over that of states which once argued that talking to the Israelis might help change Israel &apos;s attitudes . 
Arab foreign ministers , meeting in Cairo for their regular six-monthly session , have approved a resolution recommending all Arab states suspend normal relations with the Jewish state and restore the old economic boycott . 
&quot; This decision was necessary ... and it is wise , &quot; said Foreign Minister Faris Bouez of Lebanon , which has long backed the Syrian position that normalisation with Israel was premature . 
&quot; It is a clear message to Israel that continuing to deal with the peace process on this basis will destroy the peace process , &quot; the minister added . 
&quot; It is a clear message to the United States asking them to return to the principles of the peace process , &quot; he said . 
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara was visibly jubilant on Sunday night after the ministers took the decision -- the strongest concerted step the Arabs have yet taken in response to Israel &apos;s policy of building settlements in East Jerusalem . 
on Monday morning he said he was confident Arab states would comply and predicted it would damage the domestic standing of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . 
&quot; They will have to follow because this is an instruction given by the Arab summit which was held in Cairo in June 1996 ... 
it will be implemented , I am sure of that , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We have to exert some influence on the Israeli public opinion and then on the Israelis as a government , because public opinion in Israel will say &apos; Look what Netanyahu has done &apos; , &quot; he added . 
Farouk Kaddoumi , the hardline head of the PLO &apos;s political ( foreign affairs ) department , said the message to the Israelis was that their practices have destroyed the peace process . 
&quot; We have to take action ... because they ( the Israelis ) have not committed themselves to the obligations they have already undertaken , &quot; he added . 
even Oman , the only Gulf state to open an office in Israel , said it would comply with the resolution . 
&quot; It is for the Israelis now to decide whether they need normalisation with the Arabs , &quot; said Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah . 
the choice Israel faced was to stop building Jewish settlement or to continue with what he called &quot; their own brazen policy &quot; , the minister added . 
some Arab diplomats said two Arab states had reservations about the resolution but , given the angry mood in the Arab world , no ministers spoke in public against the consensus .
