U.S. cash crudes softened in Friday afternoon trading , pressured by technical selling in the paper markets and bearish sentiment in the products . 
traders said the feature in the cash markets has been the fluctuating Light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James , where barrels were dealt as strong as 22 cts over the West Texas Intermediate / Cushing benchmark . 
prices returned to more moderate levels , to sell at only a 16 cts premium to the WTI , on declining wet Brent values .
