Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso , trying to end a violent strike by police , called the protest an uprising and vowed not to give in to demands . 
&quot; This was an uprising . 
these people are deserters , &quot; Cardoso said on the state-run television network Radiobras while visiting a navy warship on Wednesday . 
&quot; This is not a strike . 
people with guns in their hands have no right to strike , &quot; he said . 
Cardoso recognised that the police had a pay grievance , but warned that his government would not tolerate any further breakdown of discipline . 
Brazilian policemen are paid about $ 250 a month . 
police on strike clashed with on-duty officers in the centre of Fortaleza , capital of the northeastern state of Ceara , on Tuesday . 
up to six people were injured in shooting . 
it was the third time in a month that police protests for better pay have ended in gunbattles . 
in June an on-duty officer was killed by a bullet fired during a demonstration . 
army troops have been sent to patrol cities to keep order . 
Ceara state governor Tasso Jereissati reacted swiftly to the latest clash , arresting two organisers of the police march and threatening to fire all the officers who took part . 
President Cardoso sent his top military adviser , army general Alberto Cardoso , to Ceara to help handle the crisis . 
police officers in various cities were due to vote later on Thursday on whether to end their strikes . 
the violence has brought to a head the long-standing problem of Brazil &apos;s notorious police force , which is accused of frequent human rights abuses . 
when police officers were filmed beating and shooting at residents of a Sao Paulo shanty-town in April , Cardoso reacted by ordering a reform of the institution . 
but officials rule out any quick move to break the autonomy of the country &apos;s military police , a step that rights groups say is essential to end police brutality . 
instead , the government is likely to introduce measures to help reduce dissatisfaction in police ranks by offering housing benefits and restructuring an archaic career structure that condemns many officers to a life of low rank posts . 
&quot; deeper reform of the police force is clearly needed but there will be a lot of resistance in Congress and it isn &apos;t going to happen overnight , &quot; said an aide to National Human Rights Sectretary Jose Gregori , in charge of police reform .
