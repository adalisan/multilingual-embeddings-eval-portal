Australian maxi Brindabella was one of seven yachts forced to retire shortly after the start of the 52nd Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race on Thursday as German yacht Morning Glory took the lead in strong winds and heavy seas . 
Brindabella had just taken over the lead from Morning Glory when her mast snapped near its base as the fleet sailed into a southerly front with winds of up to 40 knots and three-metre seas off Sydney &apos;s botany Bay , a race spokesman said . 
three hours earlier Brindabella , Morning Glory , Hong Kong pocket maxi Exile and Australian maxi Amazon -- all among the early favourites to win the race -- had been in a group of 25 yachts forced to restart after prematurely breaking the start line in light northerly winds in Sydney Harbour . 
Brindabella , a 23-metre maxi owned by Australian George Snow , was also forced to retire damaged in 1993 and finished runner-up the last two years . 
Syd Fischer , sailing in his 27th Sydney-to-Hobart race , also led briefly but was forced to retire when his 50-footer ragamuffin tore its sails . 
George Steel &apos;s 43-footer quest was forced out with a bent mast . 
quest and ragamuffin were members of the Australian team which won this year &apos;s Kenwood Cup regatta in Hawaii . 
others to withdraw after sailing into the southerly change were Australian yachts Prowler , innkeeper and Drake &apos;s Progress . 
ninety Seven , winner in 1993 , withdrew after a collision at the start left her with a small hole in her bow . 
race officials said Morning Glory , owned by German industrialist Hasso Plattner , led about five hours after the start from the Australian yachts Sydney , BZW Challenge and Condor , which won the race in 1983 . 
Sydney , designed and helmed by Australian America &apos;s Cup veteran Iain Murray , was earlier the first yacht out of Sydney Harbour after Exile was recalled by race officials and suffered a 20-minute penalty for sailing on after it broke the start . 
the crews aboard Morning Glory , Brindabella and Amazon all rounded the fleet to start again without being penalised . 
exile , owned by expatriate Australian Warwick Miller , later caught up with the rest of the fleet , officials said . 
there appeared little hope of the 88 remaining boats challenging the race record of two days 14 hours 36 minutes and 56 seconds set in 1995 by U.S. maxi Kialoa .
