Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin appealed to the military to stay calm on Thursday after a Kremlin power struggle degenerated into bitter accusations that security chief Alexander Lebed was planning a coup d &apos;etat . 
but Chernomyrdin , in overall charge of the defence and interior ministries while President Boris Yeltsin prepares for heart surgery , rejected Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov &apos;s allegation that Lebed was plotting a mutiny . 
&quot; I am far from thinking about mutinies and putsches , &quot; he told the government after his security chiefs held a special meeting in Moscow . 
but Chernomyrdin conceded that some of Kulikov &apos;s accusations against Lebed were true . 
he asked ministers and other security chiefs to summon their top officers and explain the &quot; need to stay calm &quot; . 
Kulikov , a long-standing foe of the gruff security tsar , on Wednesday accused Lebed of planning a &quot; creeping coup &quot; against the authorities in Moscow . 
Lebed denied the charges and asked Yeltsin for a personal meeting . 
Interfax news agency quoted sources at the interior ministry as saying that Kulikov expected to meet Yeltsin this week . 
the infighting could hardly have come at a worse time for Yeltsin , who is waiting in a sanatorium outside Moscow for doctors to declare him fit enough to undergo heart surgery . 
the president , who is holding just a handful of meetings , on Tuesday ordered his Kremlin team to stop squabbling and start working together . 
but the appeal fell on deaf ears and has been followed by two days of mudslinging . 
&quot; The crisis has been mounting for a long time but it broke out rather unexpectedly , &quot; wrote Tatyana Malkina , a political observer with the liberal daily newspaper Sevodnya . 
&quot; Either Mr Lebed managed simultaneously to annoy a critical number of Russian state officials , or the Kremlin has decided to sack him instead of allowing him to resign proudly . 
Lebed , a gravel-voiced reserve paratroop general , joined Yeltsin &apos;s team as security adviser and secretary of the powerful Security Council in June after he won 15 percent of the vote in the first round of Russia &apos;s presidential election . 
he is more popular outside the Kremlin than within it and makes no secret of his presidential ambitions . 
he could be a magnet for the opposition if he was pushed out now . 
authorities in Moscow and other Russian cities have stepped up security after the allegations by Kulikov , who also said 1,500 Chechen gunmen would help Lebed seize power . 
both Lebed and Chechen rebel commander Aslan Maskhadov denied the allegations . 
&quot; We have no intention of getting involved in sorting out sordid squabbles in Moscow , &quot; Maskhadov told Radio Russia . 
&quot; We have enough on our plate . 
no one has promised anything to anyone and no one will promise anything either . 
Vladimir Koval , spokesman for the Moscow branch of the interior ministry , said interior ministry troops would join police officers on patrol , police shifts would be extended and traffic controls stepped up . 
similar measure were introduced in Moscow during presidential election . 
Lebed &apos;s press office announced that his bodyguards had detained and disarmed some men who said they had been ordered to follow him by a senior interior ministry official . 
there was no immediate comment from the ministry . 
the political uncertainties unsettled financial markets in Russia and abroad , and Russian share and bond prices both fell . 
&quot; It &apos;s the politics and this Lebed coup business , &quot; one London trader of Russian debt said . 
&quot; There was panic in the morning , &quot; said a Moscow share trader . 
&quot; The market is very sensitive to political news . 
the row coincides with a two-day visit to Moscow by U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry , who on Thursday urged Russian parliamentarians to ratify the key START-2 nuclear arms reduction treaty . 
Perry told reporters he remained confident about democracy in Russia . 
&quot; The Russian people have selected a democratic government ... and I have great confidence that they will continue to weather any problems that come up , &quot; Perry said .
