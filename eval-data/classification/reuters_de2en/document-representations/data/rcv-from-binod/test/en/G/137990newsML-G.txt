Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Wednesday a wide gap remained between Israel and the PLO in negotiations on implementing an Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron . 
&quot; I am sorry to say that the gap until early this morning at five o &apos;clock is still very wide , &quot; Arafat told a news conference after meeting French President Jacques Chirac . 
Arafat called for a more active French role in U.S.-brokered peace efforts , something Israel has rejected . 
&quot; We need the help of Dr Chirac to save the peace process and to push the peace process forward not only on the Palestinian track but also on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks , &quot; he said . 
PLO and Israeli negotiators , trying to hammer out a deal on the mechanisms of implementing an Israeli partial withdrawal from Hebron delayed since March , ended talks on security issues early on Wednesday . 
PLO officials said gaps were narrowed but differences remained on crucial issues . 
they said the talks would resume later in the day .
