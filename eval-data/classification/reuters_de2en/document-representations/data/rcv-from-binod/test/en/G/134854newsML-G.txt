an exhibition of Jewish artworks pillaged by Adolf Hitler &apos;s Nazis in World War Two opened on Tuesday in Vienna ahead of a landmark auction of over 8,000 items next week . 
the auction , organised by British auctioneers Christies , marks the last chapter in a controversy over Austria &apos;s delay in returning the artefacts to their owners after the Allies handed them over to their countries of origin at the end of the war . 
&quot; Today is no cause for celebration , &quot; said Peter Noever , director of the Vienna Museum for applied Arts where the auction will take place . 
&quot; Here is displayed the legacy of those who were murdered , exiled and forgotten . 
the proceeds of the sale , estimated to reach around $ 3.5 million , will go to Austrian victims of the Holocaust , including non-Jews . 
&quot; The auction ... is an important milestone in the countless years of attempted restitution that has not only occupied us for over five decades but often cast a great shadow on our relations with the Austrian government , &quot; Paul Grosz , president of Vienna &apos;s Jewish community , told a news conference . 
among the collection are a rediscovered bust of Alexander the Great from 3 B.C. , paintings including one by Flemish master Pieter Brueghel , Flemish tapestries , Persian carpets , coins and a range of 19th century landscapes and society portraits . 
a 15th century painting by Sienese artist Pietro di Francesco degli Orioli , depicting the Madonna and child and valued up to $ 110,000 , is expected to fetch the highest price . 
Austrian-born Hitler had planned to erect a museum in the city of Linz to house the works . 
Grosz said that three items of seven claimed had been returned to their original owners ahead of the auction on October 29 and 30 . 
&quot; This decision to withdraw items from the sale and return them to their actual owner or to their heirs has proven the most important and rewarding aspect of our work , &quot; he said . 
the low number of claimants showed that whole families had been wiped out in the Holocaust , he added . 
much of the material was stored for the past 40 years in a monastery in Mauerbach , Austria . 
it was only last year that Austria finally handed over the works to the Federation of Austrian Jewish Communities after a vote in parliament . 
asked why it took until 1994 for the Austrian government to restore the artworks to the Jewish community , Grosz answered : &quot; Obviously there was negligence in this matter . 
for most of the post-war era Austria sought to distance itself from the wartime Nazi regime , presenting itself as the first victim of Hitler &apos;s aggression . 
the position only changed in 1993 when Chancellor Franz Vranitzky acknowledged during a visit to Israel that Austrians were not only victims but also &quot; willing servants of Nazism &quot; . 
last year the Austrian parliament , in a ground-breaking move , voted to pay compensation to an estimated 30,000 Austrian victims persecuted during Hitler &apos;s Nazi rule . 
&quot; If this benefit auction helps to make people aware of this injustice so they understand it and can be cathartically relieved of the burden of their past , then this auction will already have been a success , &quot; Grosz said .
