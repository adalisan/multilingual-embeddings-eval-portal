Singapore jet fuel swaps edged up late Wednesday afternoon on winter demand from north Asia and tight regional supplies , industry sources said . 
&quot; There is some buying interest seen from Japan and South Korea for January , &quot; one trader said . 
the January jet / gas oil spread or regrade traded this afternoon at $ 1.30 a barrel and was last quoted at $ 1.30 / $ 1.40 , about 10 cents higher from Tuesday &apos;s quotes . 
the February regrade also firmed due to expected winter demand and was traded at $ 1.40 . 
the market was last quoted at $ 1.40 / $ 1.50 , up from Tuesday &apos;s $ 1.20 / $ 1.40 , brokers said . 
gas oil swaps also rose slightly with January traded at $ 32.00 a barrel from this morning &apos;s trades at $ 31.85 and $ 31.90 , brokers said . 
January gas oil was last quoted at $ 31.90 / $ 32.05 . 
traders said the market is seeing support from expectations of Chinese demand for up to end January delivery cargoes . 
China had bought more than one million tonnes for arrival in December and most players were of the opinion that it had covered its requirements in the run up to the Lunar New Year holiday in early February . 
but talk of extended low crude runs at inland refineries could prompt a new wave of buying from China , traders said . 
January naphtha was unchanged in thin trade , notionally quoted at $ 23.90 / $ 24.10 per barrel . 
fuel oil also seen steady with January notionally quoted at at $ 121.50 / $ 122.50 per tonne .
