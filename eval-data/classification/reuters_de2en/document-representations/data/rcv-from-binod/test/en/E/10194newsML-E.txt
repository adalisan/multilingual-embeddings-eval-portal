orders for costly manufactured goods posted broad-based gains in July , the Commerce Department said Friday , led by a jump in demand for communications equipment . 
total new orders for durable goods climbed 1.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $ 172.7 billion -- a much more robust increase than anticipated by Wall Street economists , who had forecast orders would rise only 0.3 percent . 
the July surge in orders followed a revised 0.2 percent decrease in June orders . 
it was the second big increase in the past three months , including a 4.2 percent surge in May orders , and was likely to raise questions as to whether the economic expansion was decelerating as rapidly as some analysts thought . 
not only did July orders increase , but shipments of finished products rose solidly and order backlogs fattened last month , primarily because of more orders for new commercial aircxraft and parts . 
wall Street analysts took a mixed view of the report , which sent the inflation-sensitive 30-year U.S. Treasury bond off half a point . 
its yield climbed to 6.89 percent from 6.83 percent late Thursday . 
&quot; I think there &apos;s a lot of subjectivity in these numbers , but on its face the numbers are clearly strong and point to a beginning strong period for the third quarter at least at the manufacturing level , &quot; said Vincent Malanga , president of Fundamental Funds at Lasalle Economics in New York . 
&quot; We got a good 2.1 percent rise ex-transport , which suggests we &apos;ve got quite a healthy manufacturing sector , &quot; added David Sloan , senior economist at I.D.E.A. 
it suggests the underlying economy looks fairly healthy . 
durable goods are products like cars and home appliances that are intended to last at least three years . 
rising orders and shipments are an indicator of the health of the manufacturing sector , which generates many of the better-paying jobs that keep incomes rising . 
the only major category of durable goods that failed to register an orders increase in July was transportation equipment . 
July &apos;s flat performance followed a 1.2 percent drop in June orders . 
excluding transportation , durables orders shot up 2.1 percent last month after a 0.2 percent rise in June and a 1.1 percent rise in May . 
orders for electronic and electrical equipment jumped 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 28.1 billion in July after a 3.9 percent gain in June . 
the department said there were widespread increases in this category , led by communcications equipment . 
industrial machinery orders , which include computers , rose 2.1 percent in July to $ 32.3 billion following a 0.2 percent increase in June . 
orders for defence goods , which experience wide monthly swings , dropped 36.5 percent last month to $ 5.1 billion after a 26.4 percent increase in June . 
but orders for non-defence capital goods , an indication of business investment in new equipment , increased briskly , by 7.2 percent , to $ 46 billion after a 4.6 percent decrease in June . 
shipments of durable goods , an indication of current demand , climbed 0.7 percent to $ 168 billion after dropping 0.4 percent in June . 
unfilled orders were up strongly , by 1 percent , to $ 480 billion in July after a 0.7 percent gain in June . 
it was the tenth increase in the past 11 months for order backlogs , pointing to underlying strength in manufacturing .
