the 15 Middle East countries due to take part in next week &apos;s economic conference in Cairo run the gamut from tiny Qatar , a desert peninsula overlooked by history , to regional economic giant Turkey , once the seat of an empire that ruled the Middle East for hundreds of years . 
the region includes ancient farming societies like Egypt and Yemen , nomadic and tribal communities transformed by the discovery of oil and pockets of traders flourishing in the economic liberalism of the 1990s . 
what they have in common , with the exception of Israel , is economic underdevelopment . 
they are either low or middle income developing countries , or oil-exporting countries dependent on one commodity for their wealth . 
only two of the 15 economies have crossed the threshold of $ 100 billion a year in gross domestic product ( GDP ) -- about equivalent to the economy of a small European country . 
Turkey , the most populous state , tops the list at about $ 160 billion , followed by Saudi Arabia at $ 125 billion , Israel at $ 93 billion , and Egypt at about $ 67 billion . 
the 15 countries do not include Iran , Iraq , Lebanon , Sudan and Syria , absent from the conference , which starts on November 12 , for political reasons . 
in the wealth stakes , the small oil exporters of the Gulf were once among the richest countries in the world , in the same league as Switzerland and the Scandinavian states , but the decline in the real price of oil has eroded their buying power . 
Kuwaitis have the highest per capita GDP -- at more than $ 16,500 a year in 1995 , closely followed by Qataris at $ 14,400 and the people of the United Arab Emirates at $ 13,600 . 
that is about 50 times the level of wealth in Yemen , where per capita GDP lags behind at $ 280 a year . 
Mauritania is the second poorest at $ 530 . 
heavily populated Egypt and Morocco , each at just over $ 1,000 , are close runners for the title of poorest country with a Mediterranean coastline . 
but most of the governments , even troubled Algeria , claim economic growth rates that would be the envy of developed countries . 
Morocco expects its economy to grow 10.3 percent this year while the latest figures for Turkey and Kuwait are 8.2 percent , for Jordan and the United Arab Emirates 6.6 percent . 
levels of inflation and unemployment vary widely across the region , without any obvious pattern other than a concentration of unemployment in the poorer North African states . 
Algeria has the highest proportion of jobless , 28 percent of the workforce in 1995 , followed by Jordan at an unofficial 20 to 25 percent , Morocco at 17 and Tunisia at 15.5 . 
Turks live with inflation of almost 80 percent a year , while two Gulf states -- Oman and Qatar -- say prices fell last year . 
here is a table giving the latest available basic economic information about the 15 countries , ranked by the size of the economies . 
the figures are approximate , come from various sources and refer to different periods , and so they are not strictly comparable :
