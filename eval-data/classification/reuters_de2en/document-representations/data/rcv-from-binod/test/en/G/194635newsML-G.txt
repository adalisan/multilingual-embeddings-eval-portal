a human tidal wave brushed aside aid workers trying to control the return of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees to Rwanda on Saturday , witnesses said . 
the U.N. refugee agency said 200,000 Rwandan Hutus had crossed into Rwanda from Zaire since an exodus of refugees started on Friday . 
&quot; We estimate that up till this morning up to 200,000 had already crossed , &quot; UNHCR spokesman Ray Wilkinson said . 
&quot; The last I heard from our people on the border two hours ago ( 1.20 p.m. local time , 1120 GMT ) was that 15,000 were crossing every hour . 
UNHCR said Rwanda planned to close its border with Zaire at Goma-Gisenyi at 4 p.m. local time ( 1400 GMT ) on Saturday to &quot; control the influx &quot; of the refugees swamping the border . 
the Petite Barriere camp at the border , with a capacity of 7,000 , overflowed within hours so Rwandan troops and aid agencies gave up any pretence of controlling or registering returnees and let them plod into the green hills around Gisenyi . 
aid officials suspended operations for the refugees , who were returning to the homeland they fled in 1994 after a Tutsi-dominated movement ousted the Hutu rulers blamed for the genocide of up to a million people , mainly Tutsis . 
Wilkinson said he could not confirm a report by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) that up to 400,000 people were stretched back on the road as far as sake , 30 kilometres ( 18.75 miles ) west of Goma , en route to Rwanda . 
twenty-five refugees with cholera were being treated at Goma hospital , Wilkinson said . 
the tide of returnees blocked the main road out of Gisenyi , preventing traffic from moving for an estimated 20 kilometres ( 12 miles ) and rendering unworkable aid agency plans to use buses to transport the returnees . 
the sheer weight of numbers passing through Gisenyi &apos;s narrow streets forced refugees to stand still for many minutes unable to move forward . 
&quot; The Rwandan authorities don &apos;t want all this tide of humanity in just one point and they are using Nkamira ( transit site ) as an escape route to stretch them out so more people can come in , &quot; Wilkinson said . 
Nkamira , 21 kilometres ( 13 miles ) west of Gisenyi , has a capacity of up to 7,000 . 
a sweating mass of refugees in mud and dirt-stained rags streamed through the main street at Gisenyi and cut in two columns after a souvenir shop , with about a quarter of the crowd surging through the bush up a steep hill and the others following the main road by Gisenyi prison . 
no soldiers were in sight and prison guards sat inside their compound lazily watching the flood of people . 
the refugees , with many children and babies on mothers &apos; backs , were soaked by heavy afternoon rain . 
an aid official said up to 50 percent of those crossing were from nearby Ruhengeri and Gisenyi prefectures and so could find their own homes .
