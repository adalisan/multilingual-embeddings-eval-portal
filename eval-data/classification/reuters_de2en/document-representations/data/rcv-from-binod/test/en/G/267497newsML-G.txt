Brigitte Bardot , cheered by fans and fellow animal lovers , denied in court on Thursday that she incited racial hatred by saying that France was being invaded by sheep-slaughtering Moslems . 
as the 62-year-old former screen sex symbol took the stand , hundreds of fans outside the courtroom waved signs reading &quot; Brigitte , we love you &quot; and sported &quot; Meat = murder &quot; buttons . 
&quot; I am someone who feels neither hatred nor revenge , but I am rebellious , &quot; Bardot , wearing a grey trouser suit and flowers in her dark blond hair , told the court . 
in an opinion column in the conservative daily Le Figaro last April , the outspoken ex-actress turned animal rights activist had denounced in strong terms the ritual slaughter of sheep for the Moslem festival of Aid al-Kebir . 
&quot; It &apos;s barbarous to kill these sheep which are not knocked uncounscious before being bled . 
it &apos;s a party for everyone , but for me it &apos;s horror . 
there are fields and fields of sheep with their throats slit , &quot; she told the court . 
the charges against her , which carry punishment of up to a year in prison and a 300,000-franc ( $ 60,000 ) fine , were brought by the Movement Against Racism ( MRAP ) , the Human Rights League ( LDH ) and the League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism ( LICRA ) . 
public prosecutor Marie-Jeanne Vieillard asked that the verdict and sentence , due on January 23 , be published in the press but did not request a specific punishment . 
&quot; It is not the tradition of slaughter that ( Bardot ) is denouncing , but all Moslem traditions , &quot; Vieillard said . 
Bardot &apos;s husband Bernard d &apos;Ormale , a member of the far right National Front which proposes sending back France &apos;s four million mostly North African immigrants , sat beside her holding her hand until she stood up to testify . 
during her hour-long testimony , Bardot giggled , bantered with the presiding judge and occasionally drew reporters , lawyers and spectators into laughing along with her . 
&quot; There are an enormous number of Moslems in France now , and every family head must slaughter a sheep . 
every time a mosque is built , a slaughterhouse should be built as well , &quot; she said . 
&quot; These people have come to our country but don &apos;t apply our laws ... I &apos;m just saying out loud what everyone thinks quietly . 
in a clear reference to fiery National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen , LICRA lawyer Philippe Coen said the statements in Bardot &apos;s article had put her &quot; on the same level as those who spoke of the hierarchy of race &quot; . 
&quot; Madame Bardot sought with her remarks to surf on the wave of intolerance that is sweeping across our society , &quot; Coen said . 
&quot; Never have we read from her pen a plea for the myriad oysters that are eaten alive . 
we can see to what extent she behaves like a pyromaniac of hate . 
Bardot , who abruptly quit acting in 1972 and withdrew to her French Riviera villa to devote herself to protecting animals , said she had been lobbying the rector of the Paris mosque to have the slaughter of sheep performed in a more humane way . 
in her article entitled &quot; My cry of anger &quot; , Bardot directly attacked immigrants from France &apos;s former North African colonies . 
&quot; We have to submit against our will to this Moslem overflow . 
from year to year , mosques blossom across France while church bells fall silent because of a lack of priests , &quot; she wrote . 
&quot; Could I be forced in the near future to flee my country which has turned into a bloody and violent country , to turn expatriate ... by myself becoming an emigrant ? 
&quot; she asked .
