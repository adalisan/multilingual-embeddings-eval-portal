Cannes film festival jury president Isabelle Adjani on Wednesday denounced political pressure from China and Iran , saying Cannes had been created 50 years ago to counter the Nazi hold on the Venice festival . 
organisers of the May 7-18 competition had hastily overhauled the running slate after industry sources said China refused to allow Zhang Yimou &apos;s &quot; Keep Cool &quot; to run in competition for the Golden Palm award although it had been selected . 
earlier on Wednesday , festival boss Gilles Jacob said in a curt statement that Abbas Kiarostami &apos;s &quot; The Delicious taste of cherries &quot; would run in Cannes though the Iranian director had quoted Tehran authorities as refusing him a green light . 
&quot; The Cannes festival was created ( in 1939 ) to oppose the Venice festival which was under Nazi influence , &quot; French film star Adjani said at a news conference when asked about the Chinese and Iranian pressures . 
&quot; Its mission is to receive films which have a vocation to leave their country of origin . 
so the festival organisers do everything they can to ensure this happens , &quot; said the actress , born to an Algerian father and German mother . 
Adjani spoke with China &apos;s Gong Li , a member of the jury who has starred in several of Zhang Yimou &apos;s films , sharing the platform . 
Gong Li made no comment . 
there was no official explanation for the Chinese red light . 
Chinese authorities have criticised previous films by Zhang , whose &quot; To Live &quot; won awards at Cannes in 1994 although he had been banned from attending , for portraying China as backward in films for Western audiences . 
nor was there any official explanation for Kiarostami &apos;s eleventh-hour competition slot . 
the director had last month quoted a Culture Ministry official as telling him that Tehran would not allow him to take the film to Cannes because it should first be shown at the Fajr ( Dawn ) festival in Tehran which marks the country &apos;s Islamic revolution every February . 
other jurors picking this year &apos;s Cannes winners include last year &apos;s Golden Palm holder Mike Leigh , American director Tim Burton , Italian filmmaker Nanni Moretti and American actress Mira Sorvino . 
Adjani herself won a best actress awards in Cannes in 1981 for her performances in James Ivory &apos;s &quot; Quartet &quot; and Andrzej Zulawski &apos;s &quot; possession &quot; . 
asked how she would seek to avoid controversies over winners which have dogged previous Cannes festivals , Adjani answered : &quot; You don &apos;t look for controversy . 
it imposes itself on you . 
we will watch films intensely for 12 days , we will wait and we will also wait for the unexpected . 
&quot; We have no preconceived ideas . 
we know this year &apos;s films mirror today &apos;s society , they are black , violent . 
we are here to be shocked , &quot; she said of a thriller-heavy selection which is long on violence . 
&quot; There is one film we &apos;ve all decided we &apos;re going to hate , &quot; chipped in Leigh , only to add : &quot; Just joking .
