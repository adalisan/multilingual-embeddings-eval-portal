German pairs skaters Mandy Woetzel and Ingo Steuer have turned to a psychologist to help them deal with the remnants of their old love affair . 
the 1995 European champions hope the therapy will steer them towards their first world title this week , for they are the main source of resistance to the potential Russian pairs &apos; dominance . 
they go into Tuesday &apos;s start of the competition after a victory over Russia &apos;s current world and European champions Marina Eltsova and Andrei Bushkov at the Champions &apos; Series final in Canada early this month . 
Woetzel and Steuer used to be lovers and their former relationship still causes tension between them . 
&quot; We hope the psychologist can help us deal with our emotions , &quot; Woetzel said here . 
the psychologist has come to their practice sessions in Chemnitz since the European championships in January and has passed on some advice about effective communicating . 
&quot; They know they need to keep skating together because both know they cannot win anything without the other , &quot; a source close to the couple said on Monday . 
the Germans were second twice in the world championships , in 1993 and again last year . 
but their greatest disappointment came at the 1994 Olympics in Norway when Woetzel fell on her chin during their free programme and they were forced to withdraw . 
their Russian opposition will come from Eltsova and Bushkov , Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev , a former Olympic champion with Natalia Mishkutienok , and the rising Elena Berezhnaia and Anton Sikharulidze , third in the European championships in January . 
Americans Jenni Meno and Todd Sand , along with Kyoko INA and Jason Dungjen , will also challenge for medals , which will be decided on Wednesday night . 
the ice dance also begins on Tuesday with two compulsory dances and Russians Oksana Gritschuk and Evgeny Platov favoured to add to their growing list of titles . 
unbeaten since the 1994 European championships , they won the Olympic and world titles that year and have not been defeated since . 
not even a late change of coaches , which threatened to keep them out of the European championships in January , could deflect them . 
they came , saw and conquered the field again , under the guidance of new mentor Tatiana Tarasova . 
team mates Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov will try again , though they were beaten in the Champions &apos; Series final by Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz . 
two French couples also have medal prospects . 
they are Sophie Moniotte and Pascal Lavanchy , and Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat .
