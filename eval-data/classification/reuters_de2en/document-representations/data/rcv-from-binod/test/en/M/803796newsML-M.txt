Jakarta stocks are seen remaining weak on Friday on lingering worries following the central bank &apos;s move to scrap its intervention band and tight rupiah liquidity in the money market , brokers said . 
&quot; sentiment would remain cautious as the rupiah is very tight . 
most of our clients continue to put sell orders particularly in banking and finance stocks , &quot; one broker said . 
brokers said players were worried that the tight liquidity in the money market and the abolishment of the band would hit earnings of most companies , particularly banks and finance firms . 
Indonesian overnight money jumped to 125 percent on Friday from 50.0 / 60.0 percent in early trade on extremely tight liquidity , dealers said .
