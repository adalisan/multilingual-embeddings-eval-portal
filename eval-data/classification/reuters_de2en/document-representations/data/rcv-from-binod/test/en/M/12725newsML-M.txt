late profit-taking pulled Taiwan shares to a lower close on Saturday , but brokers said overall sentiment remained positive on hopes of more government stimulus measures to boost the local economy . 
the weighted index , which jumped 1.79 percent at the opening , finished down 9.66 points or 0.16 percent at 6,190.56 . 
early gains were inspired mainly by an unexpected rate cut by Taiwan &apos;s central bank on Friday , but brokers said many short-term oriented investors decided to take quick profits when the index hit the key 6,300-point technical resistance . 
Central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong announced at a hastily arranged news conference the bank was cutting banks &apos; reserve requirements by up to 0.5 percentage point , effective Saturday . 
&quot; The surprise rate cut is definitely bullish news to investors and the market will continue to reflect the news next week , &quot; said Tsao Chung-ping of Ting Kong Securities . 
brokers noted a relatively small turnover in the two-hour session had prevented the index from breaking the 6,300-point barrier . 
the financial sector , seen as the most direct and immediate beneficiary of the rate cut , rose 0.30 percent . 
&quot; The rate cut , which is totally unexpected to most people , shows the government is determined to boost the economy in the second half , &quot; Tsao said . 
&quot; It is only a beginning of a string of measures . 
Taiwan &apos;s statistics bureau forecast that gross domestic product growth for the entire year would reach 5.89 percent , well below an earlier prediction of 6.17 percent .
