Austrian Andreas Goldberger , twice overall ski jumping World Cup champion , said on Sunday he used cocaine once at a Vienna disco a year ago because he was curious about the drug . 
in an interview with Austrian television ORF , Goldberger dismissed accusations he had regularly bought , sold and consumed large amounts of the drug . 
&quot; I was questioned by the police and they searched my house . 
&quot; But none of this is true and no evidence was found . 
Goldberger , overall World Cup ski jumping and ski flying winner in 1995 and 1996 , said he taken the drug in the back room of a Vienna disco and that no other athletes were present . 
&quot; It was a big mistake . 
Goldberger , 25 , said the Austrian ski federation ( OSV ) had not yet contacted him and he hoped there would be &quot; no consequences &quot; . 
however , OSV president Peter Schroecksnadel told the Austrian daily Kleinen Zeitung on Sunday he would not tolerate a national team athlete who took drugs . 
Goldberger is immensely popular in Austria and was voted the country &apos;s sportsman of the year in 1996 . 
he won one silver and two bronze medals at the 1993 world championships and collected two bronzes at the 1994 Olympics .
