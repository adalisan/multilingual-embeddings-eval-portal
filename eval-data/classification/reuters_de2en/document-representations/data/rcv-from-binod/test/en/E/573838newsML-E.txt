a rise in Japan &apos;s domestic wholesale prices in April was mainly due to the increase in the sales tax , a Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) official said on Friday . 
Japan &apos;s national sales tax was raised on April 1 to five percent from three percent . 
&quot; There is the effect of the sales tax rise but the trend in Japan prices has not changed and prices continue to be bottoming out , &quot; the official said . 
Japan &apos;s domestic wholesale price index , a key component of the overall WPI , rose 1.9 percent in April from a year earlier and was also up 1.9 percent from the previous month .
