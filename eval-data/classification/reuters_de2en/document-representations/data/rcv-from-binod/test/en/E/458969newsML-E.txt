the Chilean government will send a free trade agreement with Canada signed late last year to Congress next week for approval , said the Foreign Ministry &apos;s top trade negotiator Juan Gabriel Valdes . 
&quot; The treaty should be approved before June 2 , which is the date agreed with Canada , &quot; Valdes told a news conference . 
Chile regards the bilateral trade accord as a step towards the country &apos;s eventual membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , which links the United States , Canada and Mexico . 
Chile has already signed a free trade pact with Mexico .
