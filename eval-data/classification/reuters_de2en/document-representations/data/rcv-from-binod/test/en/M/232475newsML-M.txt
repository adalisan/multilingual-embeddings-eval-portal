Italian bonds will offer more value in 1997 than their Spanish counterparts , although BTPs are more responsive to changes in world interest rates , especially in the United States , the Bank of America said in a report . 
in Spain and Italy , the current euro convergence euphoria may be exagerated , leaving little value at the long end in both markets . 
but the biggest risk is coming from the U.S , the bank said in a quarterly report . 
&quot; The longer-term risks are more associated with the U.S. than with the economic convergence in the high yielders , which is on track , &quot; it said . 
&quot; There may be some disappointment if no important result regarding the stability pact emerges from the Dublin meeting in December , &quot; the bank added . 
the Dublin European Union summit will take place on December 13 and 14 . 
between the two markets , Italy offers more value based on bond fundamentals , growth and inflation . 
but Spanish assets are less risky . 
&quot; Risk to Italian assets are overall somewhat greater than those facing Spain , but this is more than compensated by Italy &apos;s better position in respect of the key bond fundamentals in a medium-term outlook , &quot; the report said . 
at 1115 GMT , the 10-year bonos-Bunds spread was at 129 basis points ( bps ) , just above the record low set earlier at 125 . 
the spread has shrunk from 330 bps at the start of March and from 500 in summer 1995 . 
meanwhile , the 10-year BTPs-Bunds spread , which has also narrowed dramatically from above 550 bps in the summer 1995 , was trading around 190 bps .
