Southeast Asian economies are under the spotlight this week with meetings of an ASEAN free trade body and of economic ministers ahead of wider regional and global gatherings later in the year . 
the meetings will look at progress in deregulation and discuss boosting trade and liberalising investment to ensure the region of some 420 million people stays competitive in the international marketplace . 
the annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) economic ministers on Thursday will hear a variety of reports of progress over the past year covering various economic sectors ranging from agriculture to tourism , energy and investment . 
ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh said the ministers would also look into issues expected to come up at the first ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) in Singapore in December and preparations for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum meeting in Manila in November . 
senior officials from the seven-nation association open a two-day meeting on Monday to finalise the agenda and put proposals and agreements in place for the ministerial session . 
the ASEAN Free Trade Area ( AFTA ) council meets on Wednesday to review progress towards the goal of reducing or eliminating tariffs and non-tariff barriers between member states over the next nine years . 
the ministerial meeting will be followed on Friday by sessions with Australia , New Zealand and Japan . 
ASEAN groups Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , Thailand , Vietnam , the Philippines and Brunei , with observers Laos and Cambodia due to join next year -- the 30th anniversary of the founding of the organisation . 
several meetings have been held in the run-up to the economic gathering , including a three-day session of senior investment officials who discussed a framework for an ASEAN Investment Area . 
the investment report and recommendations will be presented to the ministers , ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh said . 
he told Reuters the aim was to &quot; facilitate and liberalise investment measures in ASEAN &quot; to boost both intra-ASEAN trade and foreign investment from outside the region . 
&quot; The concern is that with all the other regions becoming competitive , ASEAN has to remain attractive and be among the best , if not in front of the field , as far as investment is concerned , &quot; he said . 
ASEAN forecast 1996 growth in gross domestic product averaging 7.5 percent for the region with gross investment at $ 235.6 billion . 
Singh said Laos and Cambodia had asked to attend the ministerial meeting but Burma , which became an ASEAN observer this year , had not sought an invitation and would not be present . 
the secretary-general said separate sessions would be held with Laos and Cambodia to discuss their progress in preparing for ASEAN and AFTA membership and problems they might face . 
the ministers would also be looking at issues before the WTO meeting . 
ASEAN states have made it clear they want the WTO to stick strictly to trade matters , while the United States for example has said it planned to bring up such issues as labour rights and work conditions .
