PaineWebber analyst Bernard Savaiko said the market registered oversold readings of 12 percent and 11 percent on Market Vane and bullish Consensus , two closely watched surveys of analysts &apos; opinions .

the back months closed up 1.35 to 1.00 . 
volume was estimated at 3,700 lots compared with Thursday &apos;s official 1,953 lots . 
support in May remained at 72.50 cents and resistance at 76.00 , the high in May reached earlier this week . 
despite today &apos;s gains , there is little fundamental justification for higher prices , analysts said . 
in its monthly Florida crop estimates , the U.S. Department of Agriculture raised output to 221.2 million 90-lb boxes from the record 220 million boxes forecast last month , and raised yields to 1.57 gallons per box from 1.54 gallons .
