the Sri Lanka rupee closed barely moved in range-bound trade on Wednesday , due to the market being well supplied with dollars , dealers said . 
the rupee closed at 58.50 to the dollar , after opening at 58.49 . 
&quot; There was a little demand for dollars . 
but since the market is well offered , it made no impact , &quot; said a Standard Chartered Bank dealer . 
dealers say the dollar-rupee exchange rate will be ranged until there is a substantial import bill , as the market is well supplied with the greenback due to heavy net inflows through the Colombo Stock Exchange . 
overnight call money rates closed at 9.5 percent .
