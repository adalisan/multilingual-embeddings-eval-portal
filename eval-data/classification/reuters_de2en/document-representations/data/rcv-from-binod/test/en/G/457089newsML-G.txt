Parliament &apos;s all-party Defence Committee on Thursday criticised two ministers for persistently denying that British troops were subjected to dangerous chemicals as they prepared for the Gulf War . 
it said in a report that it was &quot; surprised &quot; that Nicholas Soames and Earl Howe , junior ministers at the Ministry of Defence ( mod ) , had not been more active in querying advice they received on the matter from civil servants . 
scores of Britons who served in the Gulf War campaign following Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait in 1991 have complained of debilitating illness , which they believe was caused by exposure to organophosphate pesticides . 
Ministers said in reply to parliamentary questions from 1994 onwards that the pesticides were used on only a very small scale to stop the spread of disease among British troops . 
last year , however , they said they had discovered that use had been much more widespread than previously believed . 
Soames told the committee that only in September last year did he receive &quot; clear , written advice &quot; showing the true scale on which the pesticides were used . 
the Ministry told the committee recently it expected disciplinary action to be taken against civil servants who had provided ministers with the suggested text of replies to questions from MPs . 
but the committee said in its report it would have hoped that Soames and Howe would have been more active in querying the advice they were given . 
&quot; We would not wish to underestimate the volume of work that passes across a Minister &apos;s desk ... nor the wide range of subjects with which he has to deal , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; Clearly he cannot be aware of every detail of policy . 
&quot; Nevertheless both Mr Soames and Earl Howe had dealt with the subject of op poisoning ( suffered by farmers dipping sheep ) as Agriculture Ministers before moving to mod , and , notwithstanding the advantages of hindsight , this is a case where ministerial experience and intuition might have helped . 
&quot; We are surprised that Ministers were not more pro-active and inquisitive . 
the committee called on the government to make ex gratia compensation payments to Gulf War veterans who could show they had been exposed to organophosphate pesticides and who were now ill .
