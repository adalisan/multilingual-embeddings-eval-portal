&quot; DSM is expected to show a drop in net profits of about 33 percent in 1996 , that is better than earlier expected , &quot; said one dealer . 
the stock rose 5.90 guilders to 185.00 . 
DSM said in January its preliminary net over 1996 would be at least 700 million guilders .

earlier today some Dutch chartists warned of a short-term correction this week , but added that the outlook for the longer run remained positive . 
the Dutch share index ignored the weaker bond market and the lower dollar though , and rose even further in late afternoon after the Dow Jones started climbing in its opening half hour . 
Hagemeyer jumped 7.40 guilders to close at a new high of 157.00 guilders ahead of Wednesday &apos;s 1996 results .
