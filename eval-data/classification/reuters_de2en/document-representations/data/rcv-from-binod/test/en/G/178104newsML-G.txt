an Atlanta newspaper said on Saturday that it did not defame security guard Richard Jewell by initially identifying him as a suspect in the bombing at centennial Olympic Park and will not print a retraction sought by Jewell &apos;s attorneys . 
a letter from Jewell attorney Lin Wood failed &quot; to explain what , if anything , is false &quot; in reports that were published by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , said newspaper attorney Peter Canfield . 
in a letter delivered on November 6 Wood asked the Cox-owned newspaper to retract 20 &quot; libelous &quot; statements in as conspicuous and public a manner as they first appeared . 
wood told Reuters he planned to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and members of its editorial staff by November 20 . 
&quot; The apparent basis for Jewell &apos;s complaint is that the Journal-Constitution was the first to accurately report that he was under suspicion , &quot; Canfield said . 
&quot; That is not the basis for a retraction . 
nor is it the basis for a libel suit . 
&quot; In fact , their letter never uses the word &apos; false &apos; to describe any of the Journal-Constitution &apos;s reporting , &quot; he said . 
the letter from Jewell &apos;s attorney objected to articles that ran in the Atlanta Journal and Atlanta Constitution from July 30 to Aug . 1 . 
the newspapers share the same news staff , but publish separate editions on weekdays . 
Lin objected to reports that said Jewell fit a Federal Bureau of Investigation profile for the lone bomber . 
&quot; It is not clear if or how you contend this statement to be false , &quot; Canfield wrote Wood in response . 
&quot; My understanding is that it is generally conceded that , even though the government has made clear that it does not now consider Mr. Jewell a target of investigation , he did fit their bomber profile . 
Journal-Constitution publisher Roger Kintzel said in a statement on Friday that Jewell &quot; was already a prominent figure in the bombing story &quot; when the newspaper identified him . 
&quot; subsequently , we reported the government &apos;s decision that he is no longer a target , as well as all the other developments that have enabled Jewell &apos;s counsel to proclaim his innocence and contend he should never have been targeted in the first place , &quot; Kintzel said . 
&quot; In doing so the Journal-Constitution acted legally and responsibly . 
Jewell , 33 , was working as a private security guard in centennial Olympic Park on July 27 when he spotted a suspicious green knapsack near a crowded late-night concert . 
he alerted police and helped to clear the area before a pipe bomb hidden in the knapsack exploded . 
the blast left two dead and more than 100 wounded . 
initially , Jewell was hailed as a hero for his actions , but three days later an extra edition of the Atlanta Journal identified him as the focus of a massive bomb investigation . 
the U.S. Justice Department last month publicly cleared Jewell of suspicion in the case .
