Canadian bonds pared heavy losses to close stronger on Friday , as domestic investors returned to the market after the worst one-day drop in prices in two years on Thursday , analysts said . 
&quot; Today there was good two-way flow , which we didn &apos;t have yesterday , &quot; said one Toronto-based bond trader . 
&quot; I think yesterday &apos;s problems will soon ease away and we &apos;ll be tightening in again . 
the U.S. 30-year bonds fell 3 / 32 to yield 6.51 percent . 
the spread between the bonds narrowed to 57 basis points from 58 basis points at the close of trading on Thursday . 
Canadian bonds experienced their biggest one-day loss in more than two years Thursday , as many investors took profits on Canada-U.S. spread narrowing trades . 
the rush of selling prompted a panic , with the long bond posting its worst one-day loss since April 1994 . 
the Canadian market weakened further this morning as the market broke through technical support levels and U.S. treasuries weakened further on concern about U.S. jobs data and comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan . 
both Canadian and U.S. bonds pared losses after the U.S. Labor Department reported that U.S. non-farm payrolls data rose by a lower-than-expected 118,000 . 
dealers said Canadian bonds prices were driven higher largely by domestic investors attracted by the sharp increase in yields and the fact there has been no real changes to Canada &apos;s positive bond market fundamentals . 
&quot; fundamentally the economic landcape has not changed this week , &quot; said Dan Kelly , director of financial markets research with CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc . &quot; I don &apos;t think we &apos;re into a bear market for the rest of the year . 
analysts said the sharp runup in yields is also likely to attract foreign investors in the near term . 
&quot; We believe Canada represents a great opportunity , &quot; said Thomas Juterbock , managing director of government bond trading at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co . , Inc . &quot; Canada represents a fabulous opportunity to be long relative to the U.S. &quot; 
the U.S. 10-year bond fell 5 / 32 to yield 6.25 percent . 
the spread between the bonds narrowed to 21 basis points from 27 basis points at Thursday &apos;s close . 
Canada &apos;s three-month cash bill traded at 2.91 percent against the U.S. bill at 5.03 percent .
