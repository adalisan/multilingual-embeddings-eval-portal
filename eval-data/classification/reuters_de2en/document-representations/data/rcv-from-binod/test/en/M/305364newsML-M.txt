the RTS 24-share index fell to 243.03 from Monday &apos;s 250.55 on a similar $ 29.3 million turnover for the entire market . 
&quot; The problem is that these new levels have been established only in the last few days , &quot; said Capital Regent Securities director of securities trade Sergei Sheikov . 
prices therefore remained vulnerable . 
but he said leading shares found strong support at today &apos;s levels , and that he was still bullish , with soon-to-be-released company results likely to force prices higher . 
current trading ranges are about 10-40 percent above pre-Christmas ranges for many of the top-liquidity shares .
