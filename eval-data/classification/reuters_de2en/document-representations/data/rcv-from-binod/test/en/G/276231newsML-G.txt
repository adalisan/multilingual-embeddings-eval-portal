Algerian security forces killed three Moslem guerrillas near Algiers as army troops combed a forest for more rebels , Algerian newspapers said on Wednesday . 
paramilitary forces on Monday shot dead the three armed Moslem fundamentalists in Reghaia , 30 km ( 18 miles ) east of Algiers , the Arab-language daily al Khabar said . 
the three gunmen had hijacked a car from a civilian and tried to flee before being chased and killed by state forces , it added . 
the car owner was unharmed . 
army units on Sunday carried out a huge search operation in the forest in the northeastern province of Tizi Ouzou , 90 km ( 56 miles ) east of Algiers , the paper Liberte said . 
Moslem rebels killed six civilians on Monday night in an Algiers &apos; Baraki suburb , the latest in a series of bloody attacks that have rocked the capital , officials have said . 
the killings brought to more than 70 the number of civilians killed this month in attacks blamed on the guerrillas . 
a car bomb in the capital on Monday killed eight people , according to Algerian newspaper reports , one of which said the blast made a mockery of government claims to have gained the upper hand in its battle against the rebels . 
security forces had put the toll at three dead and up to 20 wounded . 
the Armed Islamic Group , Algeria &apos;s most ruthless group , has in the past claimed responsibility for such attacks and vowed to carry out more . 
about 60,000 people have died in Algeria in the fighting that started in 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election that radical Islamists were poised to win .
