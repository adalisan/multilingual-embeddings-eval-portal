Albania &apos;s Socialist-led interim government accused President Sali Berisha on Wednesday of resisting its attempts to bring the Balkan country &apos;s interior ministry under its control . 
government spokesman Vladimir Prela said Berisha , whose Democratic Party has admitted losing to the Socialists in Sunday &apos;s general election , had tried overnight to block the government &apos;s appointment of a new Socialist acting interior minister . 
armed groups confronted each other into the early hours of the morning around Tirana &apos;s central Skanderbeg Square , but it was impossible to identify which institutions they represented . 
no shots were fired and the groups later dispersed . 
&quot; Berisha was extremely nervous , &quot; Prela told reporters . 
&quot; It took several hours of frantic telephone calls to calm matters down . 
the ministry is completely under the control of the government . 
Socialist leader Fatos Nano told reporters on Tuesday that Interior Minister Belul Celo , a member of Berisha &apos;s defeated Democratic Party , had fled the country and was being replaced as acting minister by a Socialist appointee . 
armoured vehicles then roared through central Tirana in a show of force . 
Albania &apos;s interim multi-party government , headed by Socialist Bashkim Fino , was appointed in March when Berisha was forced to call last Sunday &apos;s early election to quell country-wide violence . 
Berisha has not indicated whether he intends to step down despite the expected Socialist victory .
