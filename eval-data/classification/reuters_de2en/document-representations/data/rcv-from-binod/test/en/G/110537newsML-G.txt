Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko stormed out of parliament on Friday and said he had given up hope of reaching a compromise with his opponents over a referendum that could boost his political powers . 
Lukashenko , accused by opponents of an authoritarian style of government in the former Soviet republic , withdrew proposals intended to appease deputies opposed to the referendum and reaffirmed his resolve to go ahead with it . 
&quot; I do not see any opportunity to find a compromise in this parliament . 
I will go directly to the people and I will withdraw my initiative , and the people will be our judge , &quot; Lukashenko said . 
the referendum on the constitution is scheduled for November 7 . 
it would grant Lukashenko a 10-year mandate and has been sharply criticised by parliamentarians . 
Lukashenko had held out an olive branch on Thursday by offering deputies wider powers if they shelved plans for a separate referendum on their own proposed constitution on November 24 . 
but Lukashenko made no offer to scrap his planned referendum in Thursday &apos;s compromise propposal . 
Lukashenko made his latest outburst after his plans were criticised by Valery Tikhina , the chairman of the constitutional court . 
&quot; Tomorrow we will have a totalitarian regime in the centre of Europe , with a castration of our parliament and the constitutional court , &quot; Tikhina said . 
he told Lukashenko his planned constitution was a &quot; legal Chernobyl &quot; -- a reference to the world &apos;s worst nuclear accident in neighbouring Ukraine which spread radiation over Belarus a decade ago .
