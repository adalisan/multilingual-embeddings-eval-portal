the Lima Stock Exchange closed higher on Tuesday in uneventful trading marked by local investors &apos; buying of attractively-priced leaders . 
&quot; The local investors dominated today , preferring to take positions in leaders that have fallen in recent sessions , &quot; said Augusto Larco , of Peruval brokerage . 
analysts predicted more gains Wednesday on continued buying of blue-chips by locals . 
however , they added that there were few underlying factors influencing the market , as investors waited for company results and the next macroeconomic indicators . 
on Tuesday , the General Index .IGRA edged up 0.89 percent to 1,557.06 points , while the blue-chip Selective Index .ISEL gained 1.36 percent to 2,110.38 . 
&quot; The selective index was higher than the general because of the aggressive buying by local investors of blue chip stocks they considered cheap , &quot; added Larco . 
total market volume was a low 25 million soles ( $ 10 million ) on 1,998 trades as overall 34 stocks rose , 31 were flat and 26 fell . 
benchmark Telefonica del Peru accounted for 18.01 percent of trade , but bucked the trend of other leaders due to profit-taking , which took it down 0.7 percent to 5.70 soles on 792,990 shares . 
among other leaders , however , miner Milpo gained 2.72 percent to 15.10 soles on 49,568 shares and brewery Compania Nacional de Cerveza ( CNC ) gained 10.64 percent to 1.56 soles on 2.2 million shares . 
CNC was again affected by rumors of an imminent merger with Backus y Johnston . 
brokers said the short- and medium-term prospects for the market were positive due to anticipated good company results and an improving macroeconomic performance .
