Nepal &apos;s new governing coalition linking a centre-right prime minister and former communist foes pledged on Tuesday to fight corruption and end political instability . 
&quot; The new coalition government will take institutional and various other practical measures to bring corruption , financial irregularities and smuggling under control , &quot; the three-party coalition said in a statement , read on Radio Nepal . 
Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party ( RPP ) was expected to be sworn in on Wednesday as the Himalayan kingdom &apos;s fifth prime minister since multi-party democracy was established in 1990 , authorities said . 
&quot; The new coalition will put an end to the confusion and uncertainty and bring about political stability , &quot; the statement said . 
Chand , 57 , served twice as prime minister under the Panchayat system of partyless government which lasted from 1961 to 1990 and was fiercely opposed by the communists . 
King Birendra bowed to bloody pro-democracy demonstrations in 1990 and put an end to his absolute powers , replacing them with a Westminster-style constitutional monarchy . 
many of the Panchayat leaders later assembled under the RPP &apos;s banner . 
Chand &apos;s RPP faction joined hands with the communists and the NSP last week to topple Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba , who had headed a three-party coalition led by his centrist Nepali Congress and including the RPP for 17 months . 
Deuba &apos;s government was undermined by charges of corruption and the RPP &apos;s allegations that Nepali Congress dominated the coalition . 
Deuba resigned last Thursday but has stayed on as caretaker prime minister . 
the UML had held power from November 1994 , when inconclusive general elections were held , until September 1995 when Deuba engineered the communists &apos; downfall . 
the communists , the biggest single party with 90 seats in the 205-member lower house of parliament , were expected to dominate the new coalition . 
one lawmaker from the communist Nepal Workers and peasants Party ( NWPP ) has pledged to support the coalition , giving it 103 votes in the House of Representatives -- just enough to survive . 
the absence of any majority party in the badly divided parliament that emerged from the 1994 elections , and parties &apos; unwillingness to hold fresh elections have forced the RPP and UML to put aside their longstanding differences and ally . 
the next general election is not scheduled until November 1999 . 
Nepal , which maintained self-imposed isolation until the middle of the century , is one of the world &apos;s 10 poorest nations with an annual average income of $ 200 a head .
