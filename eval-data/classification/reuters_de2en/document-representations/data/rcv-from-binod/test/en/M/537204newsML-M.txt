U.S. meat plants approved by the Agriculture Department can already export products to China for hotels and restaurants , and Chinese officials may expand that to general consumption by the end of 1997 , according to a U.S. attache report released on Wednesday . 
the report , prepared by the American Embassy in Beijing on April 18 , said U.S. officials had asked China Animal and Plant quarantine ( CAPQ ) to clarify what kinds of meat imports were permitted , from which countries and under what conditions . 
&quot; In the future CAPQ may permit fresh meat imports for general public consumption , not just for use in hotels , restaurants and processing factories . 
( the U.S. embassy ) believes this will happen by the end of 1997 , &quot; the report said . 
if meat imports are allowed for general consumption , the Chinese government may change its rules for approving U.S. export plants , the report said . 
the report also said it appeared &quot; unlikely &quot; that China would switch to an export plant approval system in the future . 
the attache report also said that &quot; contrary to what many people believe &quot; meat imports , including pork , are now permitted in China for restaurants , hotels and processing plants . 
the current rules say that U.S. meat plants that wish to export their product to China &quot; do not have to be individually inspected by CAPQ , but they must be on the current list of approved plants by USDA , &quot; according to the report . 
import permits for poultry and pork can be obtained only from CAPQ &apos;s central office in Beijing , the report added . 
China &apos;s total amounts of official imports is small , the report said . 
total beef imports in 1995 and 1996 , respectively , were 17,563 tonnes and 25,838 tonnes , most of which was offal . 
but an additional amount &quot; thought to be quite large &quot; enters China unofficially from Hong Kong , the report said . 
in 1996 , Hong Kong imported over 77,000 tonnes of pork and more than 40,000 tonnes of beef . 
&quot; Most trade sources believe that at least half of these imports end up in China . 
if that is the case , then the volume of meat that enters China unofficially dwarfs the amount of official imports , &quot; the report said . 
U.S. attache reports are not official U.S. Agriculture Department data .
