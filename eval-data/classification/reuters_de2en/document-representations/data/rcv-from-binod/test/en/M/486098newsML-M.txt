the Sydney futures Exchange ( SFE ) said that from Monday April 7 the 90-day bank bill options contract will be traded and quoted in increments of 0.005 percent rather than 0.01 percent . 
SFE chief executive Les Hoskings said the move to trading in &quot; half ticks &quot; followed extensive consultation between the exchange and market participants , and will allow market users to more accurately price and trade &quot; out of the money &quot; options . 
&quot; Out of the money options have very small premium values and the move to half tick trading makes it easier for market users to price and trade these contracts , &quot; Hosking said . 
&quot; It will also allow for more precise end of day settlement prices , thereby ensuring the calculation of more precise variation margins , &quot; he added . 
he also said that options trading at the SFE rose to an all time high during 1996 , with a record 906,000 90-day bank bill options traded .
