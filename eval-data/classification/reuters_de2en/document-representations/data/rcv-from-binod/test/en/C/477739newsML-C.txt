the Philippine Stock Exchange ( PSE ) on Monday froze the prices of Cityland Development Corp and Central Azucarera de Tarlac . 
the two issues nearly hit the 50 percent price ceiling in Monday trading . 
the price of Cityland was frozen when it rose to 31.50 pesos , or up 48.24 percent from 21.25 . 
Central Azucarera climbed by 48.89 percent to 16.75 pesos from 11.25 when the stock exchange stepped in and halted its gain . 
the bourse automatically freezes prices of shares which rise by 50 percent or close to it and prices which fall by 40 percent in a single session . 
traders said the market may have reacted to the earlier announcement by Cityland of a 450 percent stock dividend while expectations of good 1996 results for sugar Miller Central Azucarera may have propelled its rise . 
a total of 3,700 Cityland and 3,800 Central shares had been traded when their prices were frozen . 
the PSE &apos;s surveillance department told Reuters that the two firms were asked to explain the surge in their stocks &apos; prices . 
company officials at both firms could not immediately be reached for comment .
