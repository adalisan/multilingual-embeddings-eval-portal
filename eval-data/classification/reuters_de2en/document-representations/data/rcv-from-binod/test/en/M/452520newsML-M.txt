Mauritian bourse authorities said on Wednesday that new legislation due to be presented to parliament this year would further liberalise the economy and encourage foreign investors to invest on the island . 
they said The Stock Exchange Bill , The Collective Investment Vehicle Bill , The Finance Committee Bill and The specialised Business Bill would be part of the government &apos;s proposals in the annual state budget , expected sometime in June . 
they added that the bills would come in the wake of a properly-running Central Depository System ( CDS ) of electronic share transfer and settlement which has helped trigger foreign interest with prompt , efficient clearing and settlement of share trading and reduced inherent risks in the process . 
the bills seek to streamline bourse activity and simplify procedures in investment , finance and business . 
&quot; ... definitely , they will give a great boost to the capital market and set a new dynamism in the SEM &apos;s activities , &quot; Stock Exchange of Mauritius ( SEM ) Chairman Michael Lim told Reuters . 
the SEM is waiting for the set-up of a new $ 60 million country fund . 
the Port Louis Fund will invest $ 45 million in the state link enterprises such Mauritius Telecom and the rest in listed shares and other high performing unquoted companies . 
the Port Louis Fund will give new dynamism to trading at the SEM and companies with a possibility of forming part of the fund are presently being evaluated , bourse officials said . 
finance Minister Vasant Bunwaree is expected to travel to London in May to finalise the set up of the fund whose launch is expected at end-May . 
last year Bunwaree &apos;s predecessor Rundheersing Bheenick antagonised the business community with his budget , and later resigned .
