the Philippine navy on Friday hit back at charges that it was incapable against alleged Chinese intrusions into its waters and accusations of drug running , and said it had done its best with limited resources . 
&quot; We have recently got unsolicited ( media ) exposure on some cases ... and we would like to clear these issues , &quot; information officer Lt. 
commander Salvador Cuba told reporters . 
the navy &apos;s public relations effort comes at a time when it is hoping to receive a major chunk of a $ 2-billion-armed forces modernisation programme spread over five years . 
at a news conference ahead of it &apos;s 99th aniversary celebrations next week , navy chief Vice Admiral Eduardo Santos said modernisation was essential if the navy was to guard the 7,100 islands of this archipelago nation . 
the Philippines recently protested that three Chinese warships had intruded into an area in the Spratlys islands claimed by Manila . 
the Spratlys islands in the South China Sea are believed to be rich in oil and are claimed wholly or in part by Vietnam , Taiwan , the Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei and China . 
aside from a formal protest to Beijing , the Philippines has done nothing except said it would use diplomacy . 
the government &apos;s stand focused attention on the ill-equipped navy , and local newspapers said Manila had no other choice but to threaten with words rather than guns . 
&quot; I still subscribe to the use of diplomacy and the use of economics to come out with an acceptable understanding of how we will be able to utilise the ( Spratlys ) area , &quot; Santos said . 
&quot; I would not propose an armed encounter ... we wouldn &apos;t want to be involved , but if push comes to shove , then we will do our job , &quot; he said . 
Santos said the navy was in urgent need of new ships , but then , &quot; where do you use your money -- to buy rice or rifles ? 
we cannot impose on our policy makers to buy only rifles . 
he said under the modernisation programme , the navy would acquire three new offshore patrol vessels . 
separately , it is also buying three British vessels based in Hong Kong that would be put out of commission after the colony is handed back to China at midnight on June 30 , he said . 
the further allocation of money from the $ 2-billion-fund would depend on the Philippine Congress , which could be swayed by another recent allegation that some naval officers were involved in drug running . 
&quot; That &apos;s completely absurd . 
I conducted some investigations and I found nothing that would lead to even a tinge of veracity of the statement that the vessel was involved in drug trafficking , &quot; Commander Tirso Danga , chief of naval intelligence , told Reuters on board the ship allegedly involved in the crime .
