retail sales rose modestly in January from a December that was much weaker than previously thought , the government said Thursday , pointing to slower economic growth early in 1997 . 
sales rose 0.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $ 209.1 billion after a revised 0.3 percent gain in December , the Commerce Department said . 
the department previously said December sales had risen 0.6 percent . 
a separate report from the Labor Department showed a sharp drop in new jobless claims last week , a sign of underlying strength in the job market despite what appeared to be a slowing economy . 
analysts said the figures implied moderate economic growth in early 1997 after a surge in the fourth quarter , which means the Federal Reserve will probably hold interest rates steady rather than raising them in a bid to ward off inflation . 
&quot; These numbers will tend to keep the Fed on the fence a while longer , &quot; said economist Ken Mayland of KeyCorp , in Cleveland , Ohio . 
he said that consumers burdened by high debt loads may be trimming back on spending . 
&quot; This should both help keep inflation pressures from boiling over and stretch out this already-long business expansion , &quot; he added . 
some analysts and investors have said the Fed , the nation &apos;s central bank , may still raise short-term rates later this year if there are signs of a pickup in inflation . 
in its report , the Labor Department said first-time applications for unemployment benefits fell 15,000 to 309,000 last week , the lowest level since the week ended last July 27 , when claims stood at 294,000 . 
economist Sam Kahan of ask Financial Reserach Ltd. in Chicago said the retail sales and jobless figures suggested that the economy was slowing but remained well-supported by job creation that has kept incomes growing . 
he said gross domestic product , the broadest measure of the nation &apos;s economy , probably grew more slowly than the robust 4.7 percent rate the government estimated last month and that growth will probably slow to about a 2.5 percent rate in the current quarter . 
&quot; But as long as consumer spending grows , even modestly , that &apos;s a good firm underpinning for the economy , &quot; Kahan said . 
the economy is set to complete its sixth year of uninterrupted growth after the last recession , which ended in March 1991 . 
Michael Niemira , an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York , said the consumer was &quot; alive and well &quot; for now and was able to handle debt loads . 
&quot; The near-term dynamic is still favorable , but what happens toward the end of the year is a different story , &quot; Niemira said . 
&quot; The second half is when we may see a slowdown in consumption . 
January sales excluding automobiles , which account for about a quarter of all retail sales , rose 0.4 percent after being flat in December . 
the Commerce Department &apos;s undersecretary for economic affairs , Everett Ehrlich , said first-quarter growth in consumer spending , which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity , will slow from the fourth quarter . 
&quot; The consumer sector will not be as strong as it was in the fourth quarter but will nonetheless be stronger than we saw in the third quarter , &quot; Ehrlich told Reuters Financial Television . 
sales of durable goods such as cars and refrigerators rose 0.7 percent in January after a 0.2 percent gain in December . 
sales of non-durables such as food and gasoline grew 0.5 percent after a 0.3 percent December gain . 
sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.3 percent after a 0.8 percent gain in December . 
but sales at clothing stores fell 0.9 percent following a 0.4 percent December rise . 
sales of building materials jumped 1.2 percent after a 0.8 percent December decline .
