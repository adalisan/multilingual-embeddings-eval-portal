CBOT soymeal futures closed mostly lower while soyoil ended higher in line with a late rally in soybeans , traders said . 
soybeans turned higher in late dealings as commercial and technical buying interest showed up . 
Soyoil also benefitted from technical interest as the December bounced off of an initial support level of 23.16 cents a lb and peaked shy of a resistance point of 23.51 . 
but some traders expected weakness in soyoil on Monday amid rumors Cargill Inc had chartered a vessel out of South America to carry 20,000 tonnes of soyoil to China . 
China had been an active buyer of U.S. soyoil so a shift to South American supplies could decimate the active export pace seen in recent weeks , traders noted . 
weakness in soymeal was tied to longs rolling out of the December ahead of first notice day next Friday , traders said . 
&quot; There is a big long who needs to roll out of that position , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Once this rolling is done , I think the Dec will come back to life . 
Soyoil closed 0.13 cent higher to 0.03 cent lower , with December up 0.13 at 23.42 cents . 
soymeal ended $ 1.00 lower to $ 0.10 higher , with December off $ 0.50 at $ 237.70 a ton . 
on the day , Continental grain was a noted seller of the January and March soymeal contracts while Refco Inc was said to be selling the December and January . 
Iowa grain bought January while Cargill Inc and Produce grain were small-lot buyers of the December , traders said . 
in soyoil , ADM and Refco Inc were buying the December and January while Produce grain sold the January , traders said .
