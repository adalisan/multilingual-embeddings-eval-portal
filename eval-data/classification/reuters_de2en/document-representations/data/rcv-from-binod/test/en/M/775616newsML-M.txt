Taiwan &apos;s money rates ended sharply higher on Monday on tightening liquidity as many financial institutions adopted a cautious policy on the beginning of a new reserve period , dealers said . 
the overnight interbank rate closed at 7.499 percent against Saturday &apos;s 6.277 finish -- well above the central bank &apos;s 5.0-5.5 percent target zone but far below the record double-digit closes of late June . 
the 30-day commercial paper also rose to 7.25-7.50 percent against 6.50-6.75 . 
dealers said state-run Chiao Tung Bank &apos;s auction of T $ 30 billion worth of shares also tightened liquidity . 
they said central bank &apos;s raise of rediscount rates and secured loan rates by 0.25 percentage point effective Friday had squeezed fund flows . 
dealers said they expected the money rates to remain in the current high level in the near term . 
in the bond market , the benchmark 86 / 4 bond yields rose , reflecting the central bank &apos;s interest rate hikes , dealers said . 
the 86 / 4 bond yield was at 6.1375 against 6.1325 .
