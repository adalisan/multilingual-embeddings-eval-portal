a Turkish prosecutor has questioned former prime minister Tansu Ciller &apos;s businessman husband amid press accusations that he was involved in corruption during his wife &apos;s four years in government . 
Anatolian news agency said on Wednesday night that an Ankara public prosecutor quizzed Ozer Ciller for 90 minutes . 
&quot; A statement was taken from Ozer Ciller regarding allegations in certain newspapers , &quot; it said . 
the press has accused Ciller &apos;s husband of falsifying a declaration of the family &apos;s wealth given to parliament several years ago and involvement in a security scandal last year . 
Ciller , who left office only this week , is herself being investigated by a court after allegations by a far-left leader that she acted against the national interest for financial gain . 
Ciller , a conservative , became Turkey &apos;s first woman prime minister in 1993 and later served as the foreign minister in a coalition with Islamists that collapsed last month .
