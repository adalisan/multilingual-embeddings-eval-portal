wall Street stocks were expected to open mixed and little changed on Tuesday , the final trading session of 1996 , with volume seen light ahead of the New Year &apos;s holiday . 
however , several key pieces of economic data are due this morning and have the potential to disrupt the quiet holiday atmosphere , analysts said . 
a series of computer sell programs knocked the top off blue chips on Monday , with the Dow industrials closing off 12 points at about 6549 and the S &amp; P 500 Index off three at about 754 . 
&quot; I suspect we could follow the European markets slightly higher , &quot; said Peter Cardillo , director of research at Westfalia Investments . 
he also cited possible lifts from strength in the energy sector , financial stocks , and inflows into mutual funds . 
trading was expected to be quiet with most year-end strategies already completed by institutional investors , but tax-related selling could keep some poorly performing stocks under pressure . 
the long bond was up 1 / 32 to yield 6.54 percent . 
financial markets are eagerly awaiting the 1000 est / 1500 GMT release of November new-home sales , the Chicago Purchasing Management Index , and December consumer confidence . 
the March futures index of the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 Index was off 0.4 to 758.65 . 
the dollar lost some steam against the yen after earlier moving to 116.40 , its highest level in 45 months . 
but the greenback slipped further against the mark . 
financial markets in Tokyo were closed for the New Year &apos;s holiday . 
on Monday they closed little changed . 
Hong Kong stocks closed a half-day session with light losses after recovering most of a sharp 116-point drop at the opening . 
the Hang Seng Index closed off 29.3 points to 13,451.45 . 
London stocks eked out a tiny gain , but it was enough for another record closing high after an abbreviated session . 
the FTSE 100 index of leading U.K. blue chip stocks closed up 2.8 to 4118.5 after touching a new intraday high of 4,123.2 . 
U.S. shares traded in London were at a virtual standstill because of the holidays , traders said . 
premiums paid in takeovers have shrunk by more than half since 1990 , according to data compiled by J.P. Margan and reported by the Wall Street Journal . 
the stock has been trading on a when-issued basis and closed yesterday at 35-1 / 8 .
