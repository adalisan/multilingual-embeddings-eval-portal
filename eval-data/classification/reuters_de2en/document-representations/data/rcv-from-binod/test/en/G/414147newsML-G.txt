Polish Farm Minister Roman Jagielinski , pressured by the leadership of his Peasant Party ( PSL ) to quit , has been taken to a hospital intensive care unit with a cardiac disorder , PAP news agency said on Monday . 
PAP quoted the ministry &apos;s spokesman Tomasz Krankowski as saying that Jagielinski , 50 , was taken to the Medical Academy hospital in the central city of Lodz on Sunday evening . 
Jagielinski , leader of the liberal wing in the co-ruling PSL , said on Saturday he would step down to avoid an open rift in his party . 
PSL leaders have accused him of pursuing wrong farm policies which brought a $ 1 billion food trade deficit in 1996 . 
the struggle within the PSL pits Jagielinski &apos;s faction against a bigger group led by Peasant chief Waldemar Pawlak , which represents the interests of small farmers wary of reforms and strongly lobbying for government subsidies . 
Pawlak has proposed that Jaroslaw Kalinowski , a hitherto little known 35-year-old PSL politician , replace Jagielinski . 
the new minister will face the crucial task of shaping the Polish government team &apos;s mandate for negotiations on agriculture aspects of Poland &apos;s European Union membership bid . 
analysts say Poland &apos;s underdeveloped aricultural sector will be one of the major issues in the accession talks expected to start next year . 
Jagielinski cannot be dismissed so long as he is on medical leave .
