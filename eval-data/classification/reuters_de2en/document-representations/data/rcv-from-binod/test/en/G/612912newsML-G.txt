general Abdul Rashid Dostum , ousted from his fiefdom in northern Afghanistan by Islamic Taleban fighters , vowed on Sunday in the Turkish capital to continue the struggle for control of Afghanistan . 
&quot; I have been struggling for Afghanistan for 20 years and this struggle will continue , &quot; Dostum , dressed in khaki military fatigues , told reporters in Ankara where he arrived on Sunday morning . 
Dostum , accompanied by an entourage of 16 , said he had come to Ankara for health reasons and would remain there for some time . 
but he said he was not planning to seek political asylum in Turkey . 
&quot; Our only request from Turkey is that it takes the lead to bring war to an end in Afghanistan , &quot; he said from the lobby of the four-star hotel where he was staying in central Ankara . 
Dostum flew to Turkey overnight by private plane from his headquarters in the northern Afghanistan town of Mazar-i-Sharif , from where he was toppled at the weekend in a mutiny led by opposition military leader General Abdul Malik . 
Malik was Dostum &apos;s deputy until he staged his revolt last Monday in favour of the purist Islamic Taleban movement , which captured the Afghanistan capital last September and went on to take control of most of the war-shattered country . 
national Islamic Movement leader Dostum said Malik had staged an &quot; uprising &quot; with financial assistance from Pakistan . 
Pakistan on Sunday became the first country to recognise the Taleban movement &apos;s government in neighbouring Afghanistan and urged other countries and organisations to do the same . 
Afghanistan &apos;s seat at the United Nations has been kept by the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani since the Taleban takeover of Kabul , but its seat in the 54-nation Organisation of Islamic Conference ( OIC ) has been left vacant . 
Turkish State Minister Abdullah Gul , a close aide of Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan , held talks with Dostum at his hotel and called for peace in Afghanistan . 
&quot; Our wish is that peace be achieved as soon as possible and an end brought to the shedding of blood and tears in Afghanistan , &quot; Gul told reporters . 
Turkey was widely reported to have supported the ethnic Uzbek leader Dostum , along with Uzbekistan . 
Turks and Uzbeks share common ethnic and linguistic links . 
the secular Turkish establishment has previously expressed concern about the purist Islamist nature of the Taleban movement . 
at a news conference in Mazar-i-Sharif at the weekend , Malik promised a new Islamic order in the north and said an Islamic Afghanistan would not threaten Russia or Central Asian republics on its northern frontier . 
Malik , speaking a day after his troops entered the northern capital , said his forces were not under Taleban command but there was no difference between them and the Taleban forces .
