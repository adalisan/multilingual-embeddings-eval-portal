introduced with music worthy of a thriller or a western , Prime Minister Alain Juppe kicked off a snap election campaign on Tuesday urging his allies to unite and blaming the opposition Socialists for France &apos;s problems . 
in a conference centre on the western edge of Paris , Juppe called on hundreds of members of his fractious centre-right coalition to set aside their differences and campaign aggressively for the parliamentary polls on May 25 and June 1 . 
the least popular prime minister in modern French history , according to opinion polls in late 1996 , Juppe won a standing ovation by hammering home his line that the Socialists -- last in government four years ago -- were to blame for France &apos;s woes . 
&quot; Let &apos;s be aggressive against those who bear the responsibility for the terrible failure of the 80s and 90s , &quot; he said before a screen coloured red , white and blue like the French flag . 
&quot; We will not put on our gloves . 
&quot; I make an appeal to the sense of responsibility of each person here , &quot; he told parliamentarians and senior coalition members , many of whom have sniped at his policies in the past . 
&quot; We form a big family , rich in strong personalities , nuances and even in differences , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But there is also a time to unite . 
at the moment of battle , the general interest of the country should prevail over every other consideration . 
he offered no major new policy initiatives , instead saying France should stick to austere economic reforms to help pave the way for a single European currency . 
among those who attended but who applauded his speech least was former prime minister Edouard Balladur , defeated by Juppe &apos;s ally Jacques Chirac in the 1995 presidential race . 
Balladur turned away to leave the stage after the national anthem but was stopped to return to hold hands in a line with Juppe and other coalition leaders . 
polls show that perhaps 150 deputies of the 464 in the centre-right coalition may lose their seats in the election , still enough to retain a majority in the 577-member assembly . 
&quot; Some of them aren &apos;t here , &quot; observed Andre Santini , a deputy for the Union for French Democracy , junior partner in the ruling coalition . 
the music that prepared Juppe &apos;s entry was worthy almost of Tom Cruise in &quot; Mission Impossible &quot; , or perhaps John Wayne in a classic western . 
Juppe spoke before a lectern with the slogan &quot; With Jacques Chirac , a new impulse for France &quot; and said the country still had to reverse the legacy of Socialism . 
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand was in office until 1995 , but the centre-right coalition has run the government since 1993 , first under Balladur , then under Juppe since 1995 .
