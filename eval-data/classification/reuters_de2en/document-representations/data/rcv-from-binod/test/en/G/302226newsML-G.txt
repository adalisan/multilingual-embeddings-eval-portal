England &apos;s fragile rugby union truce was threatened on Monday when leading clubs were asked to guarantee the unconditional release of players for international duty . 
the English Professional Rugby Union Clubs ( EPRUC ) refused to release its players late last year for divisional matches against touring teams but promised to make them available for the Five Nations &apos; championship starting on Saturday . 
but on Monday EPRUC chief executive Kim Deshayes accused the Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) of presenting the clubs with an ultimatum in a document circulated at the weekend . 
Deshayes said the RFU &apos;s demands were &quot; fundamentally different &quot; from an agreement hammered out between the parties last November . 
&quot; We have been given until noon tomorrow to guarantee that all players selected for England will be given free release without any conditions attached , &quot; Deshayes said . 
&quot; We have also been asked to sign the redrafted agreement by January 20 . 
at present the 24 clubs are coordinating a response . 
&quot; The lawyers have hijacked the situation and we want negotiating teams from both sides to meet again without any lawyers . 
England are not due to play their first match in the championship until the second round on February 1 but already there is a real threat that they may field an under-strength team if agreement is not reached between the warring parties . 
&quot; If things are not sorted out by the end of January then , frankly , the Five Nations is under threat , &quot; said Northampton club chairman Keith Barwell . 
Wales , who open their campaign against Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday , made only two changes on Monday to the side who looked unconvincing in a 34-14 win over the United States last Saturday . 
Hooker Jonathan Humphreys returns to captain the side and Welsh record points scorer Neil Jenkins comes in at full-back . 
&quot; We feel that we have both the means and the personnel to achieve that elusive goal of winning away from home and that would provide us with a platform for winning the competition , &quot; said coach Kevin Bowring . 
Humphreys was even more upbeat . 
&quot; We developed a lot as a side since the last Five Nations &apos; championship , having put ourselves under pressure by going on tour to Australia , then playing them again and South Africa before Christmas , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That was about the best learning curve we could have had and we are optimistic about out chances . 
it is a long time since a Welsh side had such belief . 
Ireland host France in the other first round clash under new coach Brian Ashton , the Englishman who has replaced New Zealander Murray Kidd as the Irish coach . 
&quot; The 15-man game is my ultimate philosophy and I will be pushing the Irish side along towards that , &quot; Ashton said . 
&quot; But of immediate importance at the moment is to beat France . 
it may well be that we might have to play a more simplified version of the game on Saturday than the one we would eventually like to play .
