new Zealand &apos;s controversial 10-year-old anti-nuclear policy might never have become law if the United States and France had not reacted to it with such hostility , former Prime Minister David Lange told Reuters . 
&quot; The two countries who did most to seal in the anti-nuclear policy were the United States and France with their reprisals , &quot; Lange said . 
&quot; They set it in place . 
he said the aggressive response of the two nuclear powers to New Zealand &apos;s anti-nuclear stance -- which turned 10 years old on Sunday -- created a groundswell of national support for it to be enshrined in legislation . 
&quot; People were saying ... if you give in now to those Americans we &apos;ll never dream of voting for you again , &quot; he said . 
Lange &apos;s Labour Party was returned for a second term in government two months after the nuclear-free law was passed . 
premier from 1984 to 1989 , Lange championed the anti-nuclear debate by declaring New Zealand a nuclear-free zone and banning all nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered ships from its shores as soon as he took office . 
the policy was eventually enshrined in the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone , Disarmament and Arms Control Act of 1987 . 
the policy triggered a deep , decade-long rift with the United States , which retaliated by suspending New Zealand from the tripartite ANZUS defence alliance with the U.S. and Australia in 1986 . 
France had meanwhile sent secret agents to New Zealand in 1985 to blow up Greenpeace flagship the Rainbow warrior in Auckland Harbour . 
one crew member was killed in the blast . 
Greenpeace and New Zealand were opposed to French nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll in the South Pacific . 
Lange said the actions of both countries exposed the &quot; hypocrisy &quot; of the Western Alliance towards nuclear disarmament and he slammed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty , saying it wasn &apos;t worth the paper it was written on . 
&quot; The super powers have never done anything on the nuclear issue that inconvenienced them in the slightest way , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They agreed not to detonate in outer space and underwater because they didn &apos;t have to . 
they &apos;ve never fixed a date for disarmament , but have always pledged to do it . 
however , he said New Zealand &apos;s stand against the nuclear powers had earned it the respect of other nations and helped to stiffen global opposition to weapons of mass destruction . 
&quot; It was a matter which enhanced New Zealand &apos;s standing , not in the nuclear power countries , but in the rest of the world . 
certainly in India , in the Asian subcontinent and in Africa there was enormous support for it , &quot; he said . 
&quot; And what has happened since then of course is that there has been an enormous enthusiasm for people to say that they are nuclear free and anti-nuclear . 
Lange said he was proud of New Zealand &apos;s nuclear-free law despite the costs . 
&quot; It &apos;s a development in New Zealand &apos;s history which was responsible internally for a surge in nationhood . 
it had costs in terms of repositioning our defence arrangements , of antagonising friends and allies . 
&quot; But we had the right as a sovereign people to determine as a matter of government policy what came onto our shores , and we exercised that right .
