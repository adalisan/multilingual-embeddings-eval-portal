Croatian stocks lost ground in intensive trade on Tuesday , with Zagrebacka Banka accounting for most of the action . 
traders put the slide down to the absence of foreign investors , who lead the game in the country &apos;s fledgling securities market . 
&quot; There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the Croatian market at the moment . 
maybe the investors are turning to some other market for some reason , &quot; said Josko Milisa of I.C.F. 
brokerage . 
fully listed Zagrebacka , country &apos;s leading commercial bank , was the most active issue with 11,383 traded shares . 
it lost 56 kuna to close at 2,021 . 
&quot; Zagrebacka lost some 10 percent from its all-time high , and has come close to its support point of around 2,000 kuna . 
it became interesting for investors again , &quot; said Milisa . 
he said the interest was likely to push the price upwards , pointing to the bank &apos;s 2C- and 3E-series , which were the day &apos;s only gainers , adding 10 and 50 kuna to close at 810 and 1,150 kuna respectively . 
of 14 active issues , 11 fell , two rose and one was flat . 
turnover quadrupled to 25.4 million , exceeding last week &apos;s total , and volume tripled to 15,044 shares . 
all other market heavy-weights lost ground . 
Pliva pharmaceuticals fell 12 kuna to 460 in relatively modest volume of 607 shares . 
&quot; Pliva is also close to reaching its bottom , which is around 450 kuna , and could recover slightly despite the fact that selling offers still outnumber buying orders , &quot; Milisa said . 
Kras confectioner lost seven kuna to 402 with 146 shares changing hands . 
food concern Podravka edged down eight kuna to 290 on rumours that it is about to declare a large loss for 1996 . 
market analysts said Podravka was likely to continue falling until the results came out . 
the biggest loser was textile firm Varteks which lost 15 kuna to 70 , but traded only 10 shares . 
tourist firm Rivijera Porec closed eight kuna lower at 147 . 
but it traded for the most of the day at the average price of 159 kuna , traders said . 
it was the second most active issue with 1,266 shares sold .
