sterling drifted lower in European morning trading amid uncertainty over whether the Bank of England would raise interest rates for a fourth month in a row , traders said . 
the pound was vulnerable after after a sell-off on Wednesday as expectations rose that the BOE might not raise interest rates today . 
Robert Hayward , economic adviser at Bank of America , said he expected the Bank of England &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 7.00 percent . 
&quot; If that happens , we may be looking at a small scale recovery ; perhaps up to 3.04 marks , &quot; he said . 
the pound traded at 0830 GMT at session lows of 2.9975 / 80 marks and at $ 1.5930 / 40 against Wednesday &apos;s European closing levels of 3.0130 and $ 1.6038 . 
on Wednesday , the pound tumbled five pfennigs , briefly dipping below 3.00 marks , and shed three cents to near five-month lows at $ 1.5912 . 
traders said the pound , which has soared in value by some 25 percent on a trade-weighted basis in the last year , could nose towards 3.03 marks but that it remained vulnerable on the downside . 
against the dollar , it is likely to find initial resistance at the psychological $ 1.60 ahead of the session high at $ 1.6075 . 
&quot; ... if they hold rates as they are , I &apos;d expect only a modest sell-off . 
people would be looking for another move in September , &quot; Hayward said . 
traders saw sterling drifting only marginally below 3.00 marks if rates were frozen . 
Andrew Smith , chief economist at Credit Lyonnais Laing , was less convinced that rates would rise . 
traders put growing caution down to recent statistics and comments from economic institutes that suggest a slowdown under the impact of strong sterling . 
signs have emerged that the strong pound is not only hurting exporters but also starting to have an adverse impact on the services sector . 
Confederation of British Industry chief economist Kate Barker said in a BBC radio interview on Thursday that the Monetary Policy Committee risked tipping the economy into recession if it raised interest rates again . 
a further rise , boosting the pound , would deepen the problems of manufacturers whose exports have become increasingly costly and uncompetitive on European markets . 
private forecasting company Cambridge econometrics said the UK could be forced into recession within two years if the pound remained strong . 
the UK &apos;s FT-SE 100 has rallied to record highs above 5,000 , helped by the Dow Jones &apos; rise to an all-time closing peak , strong first half earnings among British corporates and hopes rates will stay at 6.75 percent .
