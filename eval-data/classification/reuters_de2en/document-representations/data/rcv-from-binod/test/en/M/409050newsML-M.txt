the Taiwan dollar closed lower against the U.S dollar on Thursday , reversing its recent five straight days of gains on non-delivery-forward U.S. dollar buying and month-end greenback demand from importers , dealers said . 
dealers noted active U.S. dollar buying from non-delivery-forward trade during most of the session , helping the downward corrections on the Taiwan dollar . 
&quot; Non-delivery-forward buying on U.S. dollars emerged right from the beginning , following the overnight rebound of the U.S. dollar overseas , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; Month-end U.S. dollar demand from importers also emerged as importers saw active U.S. dollar buying once the Taiwan dollar rose close to the T $ 27.50 level on Wednesday , &quot; he said . 
but dealers said the Taiwan dollar &apos;s fall was offset in late trade to react to the U.S. dollar overseas , which had turned softer .
