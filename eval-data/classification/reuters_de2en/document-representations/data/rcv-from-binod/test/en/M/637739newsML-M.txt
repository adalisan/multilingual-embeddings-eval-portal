the mark pared losses on its European crosses after Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said the central bank wanted its currency to be strong . 
his comments offset some of the concern about a broad European economic and monetary union which have weighed down on the unit in recent days . 
the mark , however , could struggle to extend its gains as long as talk of a broad EMU persist . 
&quot; Tietmeyer helped the mark a bit but the market is preoccupied with the scenario of a weak euro and this will be a burden on the mark , &quot; said Karen Kricks-Brunnliebe , the head of treasury research at Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt in Dusseldorf .
