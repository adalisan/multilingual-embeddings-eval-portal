stocks and bonds fell sharply Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned about &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; infecting financial markets . 
&quot; Greenspan startled people and what you got was an emotional reaction , &quot; said David Hale , chief economist at Kemper Financial . 
even gold , a safe haven in times of distress , traded lower after rallying on fears of a possible rise in interest rates . 
financial markets recouped some of their losses , however , after a surprisingly weak U.S. payrolls report calmed worries that strong economic growth and a pickup in inflation would force the Fed to raise interest rates . 
the Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from its worst loss of more than 140 points soon after the stock market opened . 
&quot; The losses will be no more than a few-hour phenomenon , but if we had had this speech and the unemployment rate had gone below 5 percent , the market would be in serious trouble . 
in the broader market , losers overwhelmed gainers by a margin of 24 to one on volume of 209 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the Nasdaq composite index slid 20.79 to 1,279.33 , after tumbling more than 41 points earlier . 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell more than one full point , before trimming losses to trade 12 / 32 lower . 
the yield rose to 6.54 percent -- the highest since Nov . 7 -- from 6.51 percent at Thursday &apos;s close . 
against the German mark , the dollar lost more than two pfennigs after Greenspan &apos;s speech , but recovered slightly after the payroll report came out at 8 : 30 est . 
the dollar fell to 1.5431 marks from 1.5512 marks late Thursday . 
but it rose to 112.85 Japanese yen from 112.33 yen . 
February gold slid $ 1.40 to $ 371.60 an ounce at New York &apos;s commodity Exchange , after soaring to $ 373 in London markets . 
speaking in Washington late Thursday , Greenspan stunned world markets with a comment that Fed officials &quot; need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy , its production , jobs and price stability . 
Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; infects stock and other asset markets . 
he also rekindled concern about interest rates by alluding to the need for the Fed to anticipate inflation because of the lagging effect of rate changes on the economy . 
Greenspan &apos;s comments hit markets that were already keenly sensitive about inflation risks , sparking massive selling in Asian and European stocks and bonds . 
the market &apos;s worst fears were allayed , however , when the Labour Department reported early Friday that U.S. unemployment rose to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent . 
average hourly earnings rose 0.8 percent in November , but officials played down the rise , labeling it &quot; erratic . 
&quot; Certainly the report took some of the pressure off . 
it snatched us from the jaws of doom , &quot; said Kevin Lawrie , global foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank . 
new York stocks have soared 25 percent this year and major European stock markets have hit peaks in the last few weeks , leading some analysts to worry that market may be heading for a crash . 
&quot; I think what happened is Greenspan is trying to talk the market down , &quot; said Hildegard Zagorski , market analyst at prudential Securities .
