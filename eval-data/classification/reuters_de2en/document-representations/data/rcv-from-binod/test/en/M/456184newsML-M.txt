Taiwan &apos;s money rates closed higher on Thursday following the central bank &apos;s continued issue of negotiable certificates of deposit to tighten banking system liquidity , dealers said . 
the overnight interbank rate ended at 6.144 percent against Wednesday &apos;s 5.908 close , with 30-day commercial paper rising to 6.10-6.25 percent against 6.00 percent . 
Taiwan &apos;s central bank on Thursday issued T $ 8 billion in two-month NCDs -- the sixth consecutive day of such intervention . 
the central bank &apos;s recent non-stop NCD issuance was seen widely in the market as aiming to keep a lid on the loose liquidity that many experts say has been fuelling the sizzling stock market rally . 
Taiwan &apos;s deputy central bank governor Liang Cheng-chin on Wednesday flatly denied that this was the case , saying the bank was acting purely in response to the liquidity situation . 
&quot; The scale of the central bank &apos;s NCD issuance was determined by the liquidity situation . 
it has no direct or close relation with the stock market &apos;s movements , &quot; Liang said after Wednesday &apos;s market close . 
&quot; It ( the bank ) will not issue more and fewer NCDs simply because the stock market rises or falls , &quot; Liang added . 
Liang said banking system liquidity remained fairly loose , prompting the central bank to mop up excess funds . 
in the bond market on Thursday , the 10-year 86 / 4 government bond was at 6.148 . 
the announcement of two key economic data -- February export orders and industrial output -- had no immediate impact on the market , dealers said . 
the industrial output in February rose 0.55 percent compared to February 1996 , while foreign orders for Taiwan goods fell 1.7 from a year ago .
