Bayern Munich striker Juergen Klinsmann has apologised for yelling at coach Giovanni Trapattoni and kicking a hole in an advertisement sign after being substituted in the 0-0 draw with Freiburg on Saturday . 
&quot; It was an over-reaction , something that should not happen to an experienced player . 
Trapattoni replaced Germany captain Klinsmann with Carsten Lakies . 
it was the 12th time this season that he had been substituted during a match . 
&quot; He said excuse me Mister , that was a mistake , &quot; Trappattoni said . 
when he came off Klinsmann kicked a hole in a five-millimetre thick wooden advertising sign on the sidelines . 
&quot; I wanted to leave Munich with them as champions , &quot; said Klinsmann who is leaving the club at the end of the season . 
&quot; But we are slowly running into the danger that that won &apos;t happen . 
second-placed Bayer Leverkusen were playing Hamburg on Sunday . 
a win would take them to within one point of the leaders . 
Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer said the match against bottom club Freiburg was embarrassing . 
&quot; One can only laugh after this performance , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In this form we have zero chance of winning the championship .
