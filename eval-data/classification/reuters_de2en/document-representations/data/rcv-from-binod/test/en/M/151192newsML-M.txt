U.S. Treasury prices opened near unchanged on Tuesday , facing a varied cornucopia of data , including the third-quarter employment cost index ( ECI ) . 
analysts said , however , that while all the data being released would interest the market , price movements would be circumscribed by awareness that a full plate of economic reports still awaits the market later this week . 
Third-quarter GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) is due on Wednesday and the October employment data and October NAPM ( National Association of Purchasing Management ) data will be released on Friday . 
the first piece of data the market gets will be a key one -- the third-quarter Employment Cost Index ( ECI ) . 
&quot; If you get a number that edges up to one percent , you might knock the market back to the lows of last week &apos;s trading range , &quot; he said . 
on the T-bond contract , that would entail a decline to 110-12 with another stop around the 110 area , said Dimick . 
&quot; The last level would probably take a second piece of bad news to reach -- like the APICS or ( October Conference Board ) consumer confidence data . 
but the market will also gets data at other junctures in today &apos;s trading session . 
&quot; The data are staggered , &quot; observed Dimick . 
&quot; There &apos;s potential for a small downtrade today if we are disappointed by the ECI , but nothing outside of last week &apos;s range because there are too many big releases coming . 
on Wednesday , besides third-quarter GDP , which is expected to be a bond-friendly number , the market gets September home sales ( a big drop is expected ) and the Federal Reserve &apos;s Beige Book , an anecdotal account of business and economic conditions around the nation . 
October employment data are due on Friday . 
&quot; You can &apos;t establish a position based on the ECI because it could get completely reversed tomorrow or the next day , &quot; said Dimick . 
in early trade before the ECI release , the 6-3 / 4 percent 30-year bond was down 2 / 32 to 98-26 / 32 , yielding 6.84 percent . 
bill rates were unchanged with three-month rates at 5.04 percent , six-month rates at 5.15 percent and year bill rates at 5.26 percent . 
two-year notes were down 1 / 32 to 99-28 / 32 , yielding 5.94 percent . 
five-year notes were down 1 / 32 to 99-26 / 32 , yielding 6.29 percent . 
the 6-1 / 2 percent ten-year note was down 2 / 32 to 99-16 / 32 , yielding 6.57 percent .
