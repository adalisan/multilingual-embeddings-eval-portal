Germany on Wednesday rejected criticism by Turkey &apos;s Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan over the deaths of three Turks in a fatal fire in the country which he blamed on rising anti-Moslem sentiment in the West . 
three Turks died in the western German town of Krefeld on Monday , but police said on Wednesday they had so far found no evidence there was a racist motive behind the blaze . 
&quot; We strongly reject the Turkish premier &apos;s insinuation over the arson attack in Krefeld , &quot; said government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling . 
&quot; The investigation is continuing and we should refrain from attributing blame until it has been completed . 
Erbakan said on Tuesday Western education and media encouraged anti-Moslem feelings which led to racist attacks in the West and countries did not hand out adequate punishment for those found guilty of such attacks . 
&quot; Germany is a state based on the rule of law in which all criminals will be pursued regardless of who they are , &quot; Schmuelling said at a news conference . 
&quot; State prosecutors said yesterday there were no indications yet that there was a xenophobic motive , &quot; he added . 
three members of a Turkish family died in the Krefeld blaze , which investigators believe was set deliberately . 
traces of flammable materials were found in front of a door as well as in an inside hallway , police said . 
authorities have offered a reward of 50,000 marks ( $ 30,000 ) for any information on the fire . 
Members of the Turkish community have placed flowers outside the apartment block and erected placards recalling a racist arson attack by four Germans in the town of Solingen in 1993 in which five members of a Turkish family died . 
Germany suffered a wave of racist violence following unification in 1990 , particularly in the formerly communist east , and commentators fear economic problems are leading to a new surge of racism . 
but several fires in homes for asylum-seekers in Germany initially pinned on right-wing extremists turned out to have been among other things accidents , insurance fraud and personal vendettas . 
on Tuesday , a Turkish man was injured after a fire broke out at his home in the western German town of Haigerseelbach . 
police said they had found a Nazi swastika symbol spray-painted on the back of the building . 
six members of a Turkish immigrant family died in the Netherlands last week in an arson attack being investigated amid suspicions that it may have been motivated by racial hatred . 
German police in the eastern city of Dresden said arsonists had set fire to a children &apos;s recreation centre last month and drawn right-wing slogans and symbols on nearby buildings . 
nobody was injured in the blaze .
