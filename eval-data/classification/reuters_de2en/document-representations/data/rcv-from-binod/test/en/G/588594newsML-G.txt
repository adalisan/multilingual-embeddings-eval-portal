clashes between supporters of Indonesia &apos;s United Development Party ( PPP ) and security forces hit election campaigning in Central Java province and the capital Jakarta , police said on Thursday . 
the biggest clash came during campaigning by the Moslem- oriented PPP on Wednesday near Temanggung , 400 km ( 248 miles ) southeast of Jakarta in Central Java . 
police and army sources in Temanggung and surrounding towns said thousands of PPP supporters turned violent in the province , which has seen repeated trouble ahead of national parliamentary polls on May 29 . 
&quot; It &apos;s quiet again today , but yesterday they attacked this police station and caused serious damage , &quot; a policeman at Kedu precinct , who did not give his name , told Reuters by telephone . 
&quot; There were no arrests and no serious injuries , &quot; he added . 
another 75 seats in the house are allotted to the military , which does not vote . 
the Jakarta Post newspaper reported on Thursday that PPP supporters attacked government offices , shops , churches , other buildings and cars while burning Golkar flags during a 10 km ( six mile ) march near Temanggung involving 6,000 people . 
the newspaper said participants wore white , the traditional colour of mourning or protest , instead of the PPP &apos;s usual green , because of unfair treatment by authorities and the beating of their supporters by security forces . 
in Jakarta a police station in Ciracas in the east of the capital was slightly damaged on Wednesday when a crowd of PPP supporters attacked it . 
the official Antara news agency quoted Jakarta police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Edi Aritonang as saying the incident occured after a campaigner was detained for extorting money in a nearby market . 
two policemen were slightly injured in the incident . 
Aritonang said six people died in campaign-related traffic accidents on Wednesday . 
residents said there were also clashes between PPP supporters and youths living in a military housing complex in south Jakarta who supported Golkar . 
Golkar , in power for the last 30 years under Suharto , is seeking to push its share of the vote to more than 70 percent from the 68 percent it won at the last polls in 1992 .
