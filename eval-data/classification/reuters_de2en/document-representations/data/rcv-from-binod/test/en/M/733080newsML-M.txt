the strong outflows early next fortnight on account of the six year auction and the 364 day treasury bill are likely to see the fortnight in a deficit of about 13,000 million rupees . 
however , this amount is unlikely to put downward pressure on gilt prices or result in any significant hardening of overnight rates . 
the large amount of subscription to RBI &apos;s repo auctions will provide a buffer and also , RBI intervention to buy dollars could be higher than estimated above , further augmenting rupee liquidity .
