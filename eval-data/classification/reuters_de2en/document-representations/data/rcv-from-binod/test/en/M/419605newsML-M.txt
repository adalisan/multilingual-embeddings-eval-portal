Taiwan stocks closed higher on Tuesday despite concerns over the central bank &apos;s monetary policy , but brokers said the market was unlikely to reclaim the sizzle that added more than 1,000 points to the index already in 1997 . 
the weighted index closed 76.12 points , or 0.97 percent , higher at 7,956.57 . 
the central bank on Monday issued T $ 5 billion negotiable certificates of deposits to mop up excess liquidity in the banking system , and plans to issue T $ 3 biillion more on Tuesday . 
the NCD issues followed a warning by central bank deputy governor Hsu Chia-tung on Saturday that investors should exercise caution in the market &apos;s recent rally . 
the index plunged by 1.29 percent on Monday over concerns that Hsu &apos;s comments and Monday &apos;s NCD issue may indicate that the central bank would tighten money policy to cool market sentiment . 
&quot; But the market &apos;s momentum turned out to be stronger than what many of us expected , &quot; said Oliver Fang , senior analyst for National Securities . 
&quot; The sentiment may be a bit more cautious , but it is not down . 
brokers said the central bank &apos;s caution drove investors to shares backed by sound fundamentals . 
electronics , long considered Taiwan &apos;s strongest sector , gained 3.42 percent . 
the heavily weighted financials suffered mild profit-taking and fell by 0.44 percent . 
&quot; Financial shares would be most affected by a tightening of monetary policy , &quot; Fang said . 
brokers said they expected lingering uncertainty over the central bank &apos;s attitude to inject caution into the market for the short term . 
immediate resistance was seen at 8,000 points .
