CME lumber futures closed with limit gains of $ 10.00 per tbf in the November as well as in January 1997 and March 1997 contracts , in reaction to strong demand for cash lumber , traders said . 
random lengths quoted cash spruce at $ 419 per tbf Wednesday , up from $ 414 Friday and $ 412 a week ago . 
analysts said lumber retailers let inventories run low this summer in anticipation lumber prices would decline . 
instead prices rose and now in order to satisfy strong demand from home builders , retailers are forced to pay higher offering prices by sawmills 
active transferring of long CME September positions to November gave an added boost to the latter contract . 
the September contract expires September 13 and open intereset needs to be pared down . 
at Tuesday &apos;s close , September &apos;s open interest was 2,325 contracts and analysts said it should be about 800 . 
the tranferring out of September into November should narrow the latter &apos;s discount . 
at the close , November lumber settled up $ 10.00 at $ 388.30 per tbf compared with the September settlement price , which was up $ 6.50 at $ 429.30 .
