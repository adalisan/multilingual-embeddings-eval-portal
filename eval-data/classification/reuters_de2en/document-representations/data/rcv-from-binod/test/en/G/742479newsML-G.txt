one man was killed and another injured by a bomb planted in an electrical transformer box outside a Warsaw apartment building on Monday , police said . 
the blast in the eastern suburb of Praga also damaged several parked cars . 
public television , which identified the dead man only as 29-year-old Artur G. , said he had been the target of another attack three months ago . 
police declined to comment on the likely motive behind the attack . 
dozens of similar blasts each year in Poland are caused by criminal gangs settling scores , fighting each other for dominance or enforcing extortion rackets .
