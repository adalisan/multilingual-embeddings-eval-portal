* volumes reasonably light as cautionary stance adopted 
* Monetary conditions still tight , yield curve seen steeper 
new Zealand bank bills rallied aggressively on Monday on the back of a stronger currency , but investors were treating the high dollar with some caution and the market was delicately poised , dealers said . 
&quot; The TWI up 22 points on the day has established a fairly bullish backdrop , &quot; said a bill dealer . 
&quot; But it &apos;s been a fairly quiet day , notwithstanding the strong move we &apos;ve seen . 
he said there were differing schools of thought on whether the currency could sustain its present levels . 
&quot; A lot of our clients are just standing aside from all this . 
probably some of these guys are looking for the currency to come off , rather than interest rates to be the adjusting mechanism -- I think that &apos;s been the cautionary factor . 
a spike higher in the New Zealand dollar &apos;s Trade-Weighted Index to 69.19 saw the 90-day bill rate close about 16 points lower and delicately-poised at 7.03 percent . 
&quot; There will be increasing caution under 7.0 percent , &quot; the dealer said . 
&quot; I guess the market &apos;s going to be reluctant to do too much on it &apos;s own right , but the currency is a powerful argument for believing you stay long . 
he said monetary conditions were still very tight and there was technically scope for rates to fall further , but a swag of U.S. data this week was contributing to the cautious tone . 
&quot; A week of U.S. data in front of us , interest rates just about ready to pioneer a new big figure , it all adds up to customer caution at least . 
the strong currency also pushed yields on the short-dated bonds lower , while the long end closed only marginally lower to ensure a sharply steeper curve . 
a senior bond dealer said there were concerns that buying in the kiwi was driven by dual currency issuance . 
&quot; So people are just protecting their offer and marking it ( the long bond ) down a little bit , &quot; he said . 
&quot; People are still a little wary of the long bonds . 
just watch for this curve to steepen up a bit further .
