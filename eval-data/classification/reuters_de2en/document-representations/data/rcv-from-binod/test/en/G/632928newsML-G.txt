England striker Teddy Sheringham reportedly demanded a transfer from Tottenham on Tuesday , sparking a possible 6.0 million pounds ( $ 10 million ) scramble for his signature . 
Sheringham was quoted in The Sun as saying : &quot; I put in a written transfer request because I need a new challenge at this time in my career . 
but Tottenham skipper Gary Mabbutt told him he should reconsider because the club are in a position to be successful again . 
the London side were ravaged by injuries last season and finished in mid-table . 
Sheringham has been at Tottenham for four years since signing from Nottingham Forest and has now established himself in the England team alongside Alan Shearer . 
he has scored four goals in his last five internationals , including the second in England &apos;s 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Poland on Saturday .
