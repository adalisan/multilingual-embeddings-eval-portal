Indonesian courts ordered the release on Wednesday of all 124 supporters of opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri imprisoned since riots in July . 
judges delivering 10 separate verdicts in the Central Jakarta State Court acquitted nine of the accused and sentenced the other 115 to time already served in custody . 
those partially convicted strongly protested against the verdicts and said they would appeal in the High Court . 
&quot; They will appeal because they do not feel they are guilty , &quot; said Tumbu Saraswati , one of the defence lawyers . 
in one courtroom , the accused rushed toward the bench shouting , &quot; It was engineered &quot; , but defence lawyers restrained them from approaching the judge after he read out the verdict , witnesses said . 
riot police then entered the courtroom and escorted the judge out . 
they stayed on for the other cases . 
&quot; Why have we not all been acquitted , &quot; asked Sandra Fertasari , one of the five women among the accused , as tears rolled down her cheeks . 
&quot; We have been marked by the law and it is not good for our families , my husband and my children . 
she was consoled by Megawati , who sat silently in one of the courtrooms as the verdict was read out . 
she cooled herself with a paper fan as the heat rose in the packed chamber . 
in another courtroom , two of those on trial fainted and had to be revived . 
all 124 of those arrested were barricaded inside the headquarters of the Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) when police raided the building on July 27 to evict them . 
the raid led to riots in Jakarta in which at least five people died . 
it was the worst violence in the city in more than two decades . 
Megawati , daughter of late founding president Sukarno , was ousted from the PDI leadership in June by a government-backed faction , and her supporters had vowed not to give up the party headquarters to their opponents . 
the 124 people arrested , who were evicted from the building after exchanging insults for more than an hour with members of the rival faction , were charged with assault and disobeying police orders . 
judges acquitted all of them on the assault charges but said all but nine were guilty of disobeying orders . 
Court officials said they would be returned to prison and released later in the day after paperwork was completed . 
some 10 members of a leftist student group and independent labour leader Muchtar Pakpahan remain in custody on charges of subversion , for which the maximum punishment is death . 
they have been accused of instigating the riots that followed the police raid . 
political analysts have said the government moved to sideline Megawati and her supporters because they feared she could draw votes away from the ruling Golkar party in next year &apos;s parliamentary elections . 
Megawati has also filed a lawsuit against the Election Institute for rejecting her application to file a list of candidates for the polls . 
Indonesia lets only three parties contest elections : Golkar , the PDI and the Moslem-oriented United Development Party . 
it has said Megawati does not represent the PDI and has allowed the rival faction to present a list of election candidates .
