the body of a woman was found on Monday in Jack Kevorkian &apos;s van parked outside a Michigan medical examiner &apos;s office , two hours after the body of another woman was dropped off at a hospital , police said . 
Lt. Robert Smith of the Oakland County Sheriff &apos;s Department said the body of an unidentified white female was discovered in Kevorkian &apos;s battered 1968 Volkswagen van at about 2 : 30 a.m. ( 0730 GMT ) Monday , but detectives were still trying to determine whether Kevorkian was directly involved . 
&quot; We have not reached any conclusion on that yet , &quot; Smith said . 
Kevorkian has used the van to drop off several bodies in the past . 
the 68-year-old retired pathologist has attended 45 known suicides since 1990 . 
Kevorkian also has been known to drop off bodies at Pontiac Osteopathic Hosptial . 
the body of a 42-year-old New Jersey woman was brought to the hospital &apos;s emergency room about 12 : 45 a.m. ( 0545 GMT ) on Monday by a woman who identified herself as a friend . 
&quot; She denied any connection with Dr. Kevorkian at the time , &quot; said Dr. Robert Aranosian , director of emergency . 
&quot; Whether or not this turns out to be an assisted suicide , we don &apos;t know yet . 
Aranosian said the woman told emergency room doctors that she was driving around and her friend stopped breathing . 
Kevorkian &apos;s attorney , Geoffrey Fieger , declined to discuss the incidents , saying only , &quot; I don &apos;t have any comment at this time . 
Kevorkian has taken a break from his assisted suicide activities in recent months , due largely to new charges that were filed against him in two Michigan counties . 
last month , however , Oakland County &apos;s new prosecutor , David Gorcyca , dropped 19 criminal charges against Kevorkian brought last year by Richard Thompson , who lost a primary election to Gorcyca . 
at the time , Gorcyca said it would be a waste of taxpayer money to prosecute Kevorkian without an explicit state statute banning assisted suicide . 
Kevorkian has been acquitted in three trials since 1994 . 
but Kevorkian is still expected to stand trial in rural Ionia County , mich . , sometime this spring , on assisted sucide charges in the death of a 54-year-old woman . 
a condition of his bond in the case was to refrain from participating in further suicides .
