Brazil &apos;s national debt as a percentage of GDP is likely to increase by a few percentage points over the next two years before stabilising , a senior central bank official said on Tuesday . 
&quot; The national debt could increase by a couple of percentage points or more over the next two years , &quot; Gustavo Franco , director of international affairs at Brazil &apos;s central bank , told a conference of investors in London . 
&quot; It is now about one-third of gross domestic product , &quot; he added . 
&quot; It increased last year because of the fiscal deficit and it could increase a bit more over the next two years while we achieve stabilisation of debt to GDP . 
on Monday , Brazil &apos;s central bank released data putting net public sector debt at 252.701 billion reais , or 35 percent of GDP , but added the trend was towards stabilisation . 
a central bank official in Brasilia said the the sharp increase in the debt to GDP ratio since December had been due to the government &apos;s policy of high interest rates , currently among the highest in Latin America .
