a former Soviet KGB agent was arraigned in federal court in Massachusetts on Tuesday on charges he conspired to steal top secret information about the U.S. &quot; Star Wars &quot; defence programme . 
in court papers that read like a stilted John Le Carre novel , Vladimir Galkin was accused of being a retired agent for the KGB who tried in 1991 to obtain secret reports and information about the Star Wars programme -- officially known as the Strategic Defence Initiative . 
the 50-year-old former spy , who did not conceal his past occupation on a visa application , was arrested on Oct . 29 at John F. Kennedy airport in New York . 
according to the criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Worcester , Massachusetts , Galkin is suspected of being the spymaster for an Indian businessman . 
Galkin was ordered returned to jail after the arraignment . 
the businessman , Aluru Prasad , 50 , a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a self-made millionaire with a battery factory in Hyderabad , India , was tried over the summer on charges of trying to obtain U.S. military secrets and selling them to the KGB . 
U.S. District Judge Reginald Lindsay , at the urging of both the defence and prosecution , declared a mistrial in August , ruling the jury had heard evidence that would unfairly prejudice their verdict . 
he will be retried next month . 
the key witness against Prasad , who is expected to testify against Galkin , is Subrahamanyam Kota , 51 , who was born in India but now lives in Northborough , Massachusetts . 
Kota , a software executive who worked for Digital Equipment Corp , pleaded guilty in June to reduced charges , including fraud , tax evasion and conspiracy , in return for his testimony against Prasad . 
Kota met with Galkin in Cyprus , where he sought payment of up to $ 10,000 for each report related to the Star Wars technology , according to the complaint . 
the reports Galkin was allegedly seeking included the results of a March 27-31 symposium on sensors and sensor Fusion held in Orlando , Florida , the conclusions of an Electrical Energy gun Conference at the Naval Post graduate school in Monterey , California , and a discussion at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado on &quot; electronic warfare challenges for space systems , &quot; according to the complaint . 
Dr. William Frederick , an official at the ballistic Missile Defence Organisation at the Pentagon , testified during Prasad &apos;s trial that if these reports had been given to the KGB , &quot; It would show the USSR what our state-of the-art was . 
Prasad &apos;s second trial is scheduled for Dec . 9 . 
prosecutors declined to comment on reports Galkin would be offered a deal in exchange for his testimony against Prasad . 
in Moscow , Russian authorities on Tuesday demanded Galkin &apos;s release and called his arrest a &quot; deliberate provocation &quot; that could sour relations with Washington . 
foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a news briefing in Moscow that Galkin &quot; must be immediately freed without any conditions . 
the case against him must be dropped . 
&quot; We believe that the U.S. side must understand that its irresponsible actions may have negative consequences for Russia-U.S. 
relations .
