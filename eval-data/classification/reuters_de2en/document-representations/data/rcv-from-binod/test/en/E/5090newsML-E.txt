Australia &apos;s largest home lender , Commonwealth Bank of Australia , reported a record annual profit on Wednesday but warned that the outlook was clouded by slowing economic growth , rising bad loans and costs . 
Commonwealth , which became fully privatised last month after the Australian government sold its remaining 50.4 percent stake to the public , reported a 13.8 percent rise in net profit to A $ 1.12 billion ( US $ 873.6 million ) for the year to June 30 , 1996 . 
&quot; Although this is a robust result for the year just ended , the outlook for the Commonwealth Bank is increasingly difficult , &quot; managing director David Murray told reporters . 
&quot; The overall environment for businesses has deteriorated noticeably over the past 12 months , which amounts to a margin and profit squeeze for businesses . 
the slowing economy had led to a rise in problem loans during the fourth quarter of 1995 / 96 , although the charge for bad or doubtful debts was still at a cyclically low level and down 38 percent for the overall year , he said . 
&quot; We have noticed a slight upturn in troublesome loans evident in the last quarter of 1995 / 96 , &quot; Murray said .
