a Swiss-based Christian organisation said on Friday Sudan had launched a &quot; scorched earth &quot; policy in areas in the east of the country where it was facing a mounting challenge by rebels . 
Christian Solidarity International ( CSI ) said a two-member team it send on a covert visit last week to the south of Sudan &apos;s Blue Nile region reported that government forces were &quot; bombing and torching &quot; villages right across the area . 
&quot; The government of Sudan is waging a new scorched earth policy against its own civilians in the closed areas of east-central Sudan near the Etiopian border , &quot; said a statement from CSI , which has its headquarters in Zurich . 
&quot; Since the village-razing programme was launched last Spring , at least 50,000 people have been forced to flee from their homes , &quot; the statement declared . 
most of the displaced -- which CSI said included Moslems as well as Christians and animists -- were now living in makeshift shelters or in the open &quot; and are reduced to scavenging for nuts , roots and fruit . 
&quot; Many are now dying of starvation and disease , &quot; the statement said , citing its team -- British parliamentarian Baroness Caroline Cox and CSI official John Eibner , who have both made previous undercover visits to Sudan . 
in a letter to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata and High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso , CSI appealed for action to start urgent emergency airdrops of food and medicines to the displaced . 
&quot; The destruction of villages is accomplished by a combination of aerial bombardment with Antonov bombers and helicopter gunships , in conjunction with ground attacks by the government of Sudan &apos;s regular army and various government- supported militias , &quot; CSI said . 
the latest attack , it added , occurred on January 3 when government troops raided and torched the village of Pakeg , some 50 km ( 30 miles ) south of the town of Yabus . 
government policy , CSI declared , appeared intended to punish the local population for supporting the Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) -- which earlier on Friday said it had captured the town of Maban in the Blue Nile region . 
the area has long been closed to U.N. and other international relief agencies who have been refused permission to go there by the authorities in the capital , Khartoum . 
CSI said Eibner and Baroness Cox , a member of the British House of Lords , had delivered one tonne of emergency medical supplies to the refugees . 
&quot; But much more is needed to sustain the destitute displaced population in their own land and to avert a major humanitarian crisis in neighbouring Ethiopia &quot; to where several thousand had fled , the statement added . 
failure by the international community to launch an emergency relief operation were mounted immedtiately , CSI said , &quot; will condemn thousands to death by starvation and disease .
