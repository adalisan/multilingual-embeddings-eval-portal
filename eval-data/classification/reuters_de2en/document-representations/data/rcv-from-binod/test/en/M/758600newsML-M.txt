a roller-coaster ride for Australian grain prices in the past week is likely to leave the market volatile as weather drives the market , traders believe . 
last week began with South Australian growers saying their 1997 / 98 wheat and grains production looked like falling by at least 40 percent because of El Nino drought . 
wheat prices rose . 
the week ended with private forecasts of rain headed toward southern parts of the grainbelt . 
prices crashed . 
hard heads in the industry are standing back while the markets toss and turn . 
Australian Wheat Board ( AWB ) chairman Trevor Flugge , in several public appearances during the week , declined to forecast the crop , citing weather uncertainties . 
Xavier Martin , chairman of the New South Wales Farmers &apos; Association grains committee , described the 1997 / 98 crop as &quot; on a knife-edge &quot; . 
grains Council of Australia president Brendan Stewart , addressing a conference in Sydney , stood by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics ( ABARE ) forecast of 16.3 million tonnes , down from 23.5 million tonnes . 
in Stewart &apos;s view , El Nino was affecting only a small part of Australia , with good opening rains in most of Western Australia ( Wa ) , Queensland and much of New South Wales ( NSW ) . 
in contrast , Martin described rain as &quot; desperately needed &quot; in much of NSW . 
uncertainty at this level caused prices to swing stongly over the week . 
physical market prices tailed futures prices , which jumped in comparatively heavy volume from Monday through to Thursday . 
forecasts on Friday that rain was headed for southern parts of Australia cut the January 1998 settlement price back to A $ 193.50 . 
bill Mitchell of New England Agricultural Traders now sees Sydney as over-bought and likely to decline further , while Chicago seems set to rally a little higher . 
&quot; We may just see them moving in different directions , it wouldn &apos;t surprise at all , &quot; he said . 
Guy Allen of GrainCorp remains sceptical of doomsday views . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s as bad as they &apos;re painting the picture . 
they typically kill the wheat crop two or three times , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think we &apos;re going to see more of this volatility in the next six weeks , until we get through until about October . 
world wheat markets seem unlikely to be affected by the Australian wheat outcome , despite the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the 1997 / 98 crop . 
Brendan Hillary of ANZ futures estimates Australia would have to produce less than 11 million tonnes for it to have a big impact on world prices . 
and the AWB &apos;s Flugge is quite optimistic about the world market overall . 
he sees significantly higher prices at the end of the year , buoyed by strong demand . 
the AWB &apos;s view of the wheat world in 1997 / 98 is for Egypt to increase its imports by 300,000 tonnes to 6.9 million tonnes , Pakistan to increase its imports by two million tonnes to five million tonnes , India to boost its imports by a further 1.4 million tonnes to three million tonnes , and Iraq to increase its imports by 1.8 million tonnes to three million tonnes .
