scientists have found a gene responsible for Parkinson &apos;s Disease in some families , establishing that at least one form of the degenerative nerve illness can be inherited . 
the finding , announced on Thursday by the National Institutes of Health and reported in Friday &apos;s edition of the journal Science , gives researchers a powerful new tool for understanding Parkinson &apos;s Disease and could lead to new methods of slowing or stabilising the illness . 
patients with Parkinson &apos;s , who include such well-known people as Attorney General Janet Reno and evangelist Billy Graham , suffer from tremors , limited mobility and sometimes dementia . 
it is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer &apos;s , afflicting about 500,000 people in the United States , with about 50,000 new cases reported each year . 
the disorder is most frequent among those in their 70s and 80s . 
it occurs when nerves in the part of the brain that controls movement degenerate , creating a shortage of a chemical known as dopamine . 
characteristic symptoms include shaking and trembling of a limb and , later , a slow , shuffling walk and stooped posture . 
the motor problems can be very limiting and can interfere with speech . 
in some cases the illness results in dementia . 
drugs can control the disease in its early stages and some people are able to carry out normal activities for years , but it grows more severe over time and there is no known cure . 
Dr. Mihael Polymeropoulos of the National Centre for Human Genome Research and colleagues discovered the gene in one vast Italian family , known for reasons of medical privacy as the Contessi kindred for the hometown of a common ancestor 11 generations ago . 
more than 600 family members have been identified on three continents and about one in 10 is known to have had Parkinson &apos;s . 
&quot; We have succeeded in identifying for the first time a gene responsible for Parkinson &apos;s Disease in some families , &quot; Polymeropoulos told a news conference . 
he said his team found the gene and identified a specific defect in it that caused one specific form of Parkinson &apos;s -- the type that runs in families and whose symptoms appear before the age of 60 . 
the gene spells out instructions for making a protein called alpha synuclein and plays a role in the function of nerve cells . 
Polymeropoulos stressed that the discovery had no immediate , direct application to the treatment of Parkinson &apos;s but , for the first time , would allow scientists to begin research on developing drugs aimed at the cause and not just the symptoms of the disease . 
NIH Director Dr. Harold Varmus hailed the finding as &quot; a milestone but not the end of the road &quot; in understanding Parkinson &apos;s and other diseases . 
&quot; This gene and other similar genes that are known to exist elsewhere in the human genome are now expected to help scientists decipher additional causes of Parkinson &apos;s and perhaps shed light on other devastating and common brain disorders such as Alzheimer &apos;s disease , &quot; he said .
