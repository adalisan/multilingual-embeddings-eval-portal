rain on Friday forced the Green Bay packers to curtail practice for the Super bowl but the New England patriots had a full workout . 
while weather will not be a factor in Sunday &apos;s Super bowl XXXI inside the Louisiana Superdome , heavy rain prevented the packers from getting in their last full practice . 
&quot; Actually it may work out for the best because they are happy about it , &quot; packers coach Mike Holmgren said after he sent his players back to their hotel after only 10 minutes of work . 
&quot; We could have gone through a walk-through , but the field was pretty slippery and I didn &apos;t want anyone to pull a muscle at this stage . 
Holmgren decided to end the morning practice session when he saw tight end Mark Chmura slip while trying to turn on the team &apos;s outdoor practice field . 
the patriots , meanwhile , managed to get in a full 75-minute workout later when there was a break in the weather , although the field &apos;s artificial surface was still wet . 
the players did not wear their full uniforms -- just helmets , shorts and T-shirts . 
&quot; I can &apos;t ask any more of our guys from a preparation standpoint , &quot; New England coach Bill Parcells said . 
&quot; They &apos;re ready to play the game now .
