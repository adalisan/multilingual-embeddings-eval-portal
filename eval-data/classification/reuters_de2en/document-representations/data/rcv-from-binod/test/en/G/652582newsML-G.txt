dissident Congolese militia leader Denis Sassou Nguesso called on his supporters on Wednesday to observe a ceasefire after seven days of fighting with the army of President Pascal Lissouba . 
Sassou Nguesso , speaking on his militia &apos;s own radio station , Radio Congo Freedom , asked &quot; that the arms be silenced &quot; . 
he was responding to an earlier announcement by Lissouba of a unilateral ceasefire . 
&quot; I ask that the arms be silent and hope that other parties , at least this time , respect their commitments , and that the parties in conflict will keep their positions on the ground , &quot; the former Marxist president said . 
earlier in the day Lissouba had said on state radio : &quot; I order an immediate ceasefire to give a chance for mediation . 
peace must remain our first objective . 
the president &apos;s announcement followed a meeting he held on Tuesday with Brazzaville Mayor Bernard Kolelas who is chairing a mediation committee of the two sides . 
a spokesman for Kolelas said that he had spoken by telephone on Wednesday with Sassou Nguesso . 
in his broadcast , the rebel leader said the reason he had declared the ceasefire was because he cared about &quot; the need to organise transparent presidential elections in July , the free circulation of candidates and voters across the whole country . 
it was too early to say whether the ceasefire would take hold . 
a Reuters correspondent said that , early in the evening , heavy fire could be heard from the French base at the city &apos;s airport including mortars , rocket-propelled grenades and tracer fire . 
late in the evening , though , the shooting had died down .
