the dollar propelled upwards against the yen by late Tokyo on Friday , paring overnight losses amid concerns about the dollar &apos;s recent rapid fall . 
dealers said its rise was mostly triggered by constant short-covering by interbank dealers and some sporadic importer purchases , though selling interest from exporters and some Japanese investors above 117 yen put pressure on its topside . 
&quot; Traders who had sold dollars overnight to test the downside amid talk of constant stop-loss sales near and below 115 yen were disappointed to see that the greenback only fell to 114.70 yen overnight , &quot; a city bank dealer said . 
he added that trading energy of such traders ebbed in Tokyo , while short-covering dominated the Asian session , pushing the dollar back up again . 
in the afternoon , the dollar briefly dipped on a wire service report that a senior Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) official said the central bank is not concerned about the pace of the dollar &apos;s decline against the yen so far . 
dealers said the report took traders off guard and triggered some dollar sales , but the impact was limited . 
another slew of short-covering and some importer bids soon appeared and supported the U.S. currency against the yen . 
on the topside , exporter offers and some hedge sales by Japanese institutional investors were expected above 117 yen , weighing on the dollar . 
but some dealers said the amount of those offers were not large . 
in the morning , the dollar rose as high as 117.06 yen on powerful wave of short-covering , dealers said . 
a trust bank dealer said some traders had bought dollars in the morning in an attempt to set off stop-loss purchases ( corrects from &quot; stop-loss sales &quot; ) near 117 yen . 
but since those stops have been triggered , a further jump in the dollar is unlikely , he added . 
overnight comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that a strong dollar is in interests of the United States also supported the dollar against the yen , dealers said . 
but they said most operators want to square their positions ahead of key events and data next week , such as Japan &apos;s customs-cleared trade data for April on Monday and the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting on Tuesday . 
&quot; previously the market focused mostly on the ( U.S.-Japan ) interest rate gap . 
but now Japan &apos;s trade surplus with the United States and comments from monetary officials are being closely watched for further clues , &quot; the city bank dealer said . 
finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka reiterated on Friday that the Group of Seven agreement on currencies reached in late April had filtered through to the market , and that Japan would act in a timely and appropriate manner based on this agreement . 
the dollar rose against the mark , hovering above 1.70 marks for the most of the Asian session .
