the Federal Open Market Committee voted 11 to one at its July 2-3 meeting to keep short-term U.S. interest rates steady with a bias toward tightening , according to minutes released on Friday . 
since the July meeting , the FOMC has again convened on August 20 and again elected to keep interest rates unchanged . 
the minutes of that meeting will not be made public until after the next gathering scheduled for September 24 . 
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Gary Stern dissented &quot; because he was was convinced that a modestly more restrictive policy was warranted , &quot; the minutes said . 
beside concern about the economy &apos;s momentum and strains on resources , Stern dissented for an immediate tightening because &quot; current circumstances were favorable for policy action to reduce inflation further . 
although the FOMC adopted an inter-meeting tightening bias , &quot; several members commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten policy monetary policy at some point , &quot; the m , inutes said . 
some members cautioned a tightening bias may &quot; have a more pronounced effect than usual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and might generate expectations of further tightening , &quot; the minutes also said . 
the FOMC agreed the 5.25-percent federal funds rate would not be raised inter meetings without further consultation . 
&quot; Under the circumstances , the Committee would consult in some way before any policy tightening was undertaken , &quot; the minutes also said . 
some members saw the risk that a delayed policy action may result in more aggressive tightening moves . 
the minutes showed a consensus at the FOMC in July that &quot; the current stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view as clearly accomodative . 
based on this assessment , the 11 members who voted to keep rates steady &quot; preferred or could accept an asymmetric directive that was biased toward restraint , &quot; the minutes said . 
the minutes showed an FOMC consensus around the view &quot; the most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation . 
given the momentum in the econmy , the FOMC members reiterated the need for added vigilance . 
&quot; The members saw a substantial risk that if economic growth did not slow in line with their current foreceasts , the resulting added pressures on resources would at some point translate into higher price inflation , &quot; the minutes said . 
&quot; The factors bearing on the outlook for resource use and inflation needed to be monitored with special care in this period , &quot; the minutes also said . 
still , the FOMC members saw &quot; the outlook for inflation as a source of substantial uncertainty &quot; and said it would depend on the performance of food and energy prices as well as on &quot; underlying cost pressures in the economy . 
several FOMC members noted &quot; the levels of of utilization of capital and Labor resources that had prevailed over the past couple of years would have been expected on the basis of past historical patterns , to foster rising cost pressures and greater inflation . 
the minutes , however , noted that , despite a unemployment rate &quot; and widespread anecdotal reports of tight Labor markets across the country , there were only limited indications in national data that wage inflation might be increasing . 
looking forward , the FOMC members expected housing to dampen the expansion due to higher mortgage rates . 
the FOMC members also expected consumer spending to moderate , reflecting &quot; the projected slowing in income growth , &quot; the impact of consumers &apos; debt burden and the satisfaction of pent-up demand . 
business expenditures , overall , were expected to grow at a slower pace with &quot; spending for computer equipment ... thought likely to remain buoyant . 
the FOMC viewed &quot; business inventory investment ... as a key upside risk in the economic outlook for coming quarters . 
&quot; The minutes noted inventory investment has turned positive though &quot; current inventory-to-ratios appeared to be relatively lean .
