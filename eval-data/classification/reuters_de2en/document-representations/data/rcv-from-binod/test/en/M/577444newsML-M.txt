IPE Brent futures look set to climb above $ 19 a barrel early on Monday for the first time since April 2 , technical analysts said on Monday . 
the June contract may head for resistance at $ 19.27 but was untraded and talking either side of $ 19 on the SIMEX ahead of the IPE opening . 
&quot; It was a reasonably strong close to last week , well above the $ 18.75 mark , &quot; said Tony Machacek of Credit Lyonnais rouse in London . 
&quot; I would have thought a potential objective is the $ 19.50 to $ 20 range , &quot; he said . 
brokers expected the contract to start trading on the IPE around 10 cents above Friday &apos;s close of $ 18.93 . 
the cautiously bullish outlook for Brent reflects a firm tone seen at the end of last week . 
then , Brent managed to fill and then break above a chart gap that marked the top of a month-long trading range . 
Inter-month spreads also firmed turning the June to July spreads into a 17-cent-a-barrel backwardation . 
a week ago the two contracts were in contango and had been for nearly two months . 
IPE gas oil also looks technically strong , said analysts , and is due to open between $ 1 and $ 1.50 a tonne over Friday &apos;s close of $ 170.75 . 
the nearby contract needs to break resistance at last month &apos;s high of $ 172.50 and then aim for $ 176.75 , they said . 
the nearby May contract expires at noon on Monday and carries a premium of around $ 3 a tonne to June . 
the June contract also has resistance at $ 171 , the high hit last month . 
some analysts expected the June to July spread to firm in line with the backwardation on Brent . 
currently the two months are in contango by about $ 1 a tonne .
