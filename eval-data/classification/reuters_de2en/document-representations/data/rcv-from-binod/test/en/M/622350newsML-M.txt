German call money rates traded mostly steady at just under three percent on Wednesday as bank reserve holdings appeared ample , but dealers warned prices may gyrate this afternoon as banks prepare for Thursday &apos;s holiday . 
&quot; The reserve numbers look good but we do not know what the situation will be like this afternoon so conditions could still turn quite volatile , &quot; said one chief money market trader . 
overnight funds traded between 2.95 / 3.00 percent early Wednesday , virtually unchanged from Tuesday &apos;s levels . 
&quot; Funds are cheap right now , but we should not be fooled to think they will keep slipping , &quot; explained another dealer . 
banks held 44 billion marks in reserve at the Bundesbank on Tuesday , far above the preliminary 39.5 billion mark target for the month . 
on Monday banks held 41.9 billion marks in non-interest bearing accounts at the Bundesbank . 
reserves were stocked up on Tuesday as the Bundesbank injected more funds than expected at the weekly tender allocation . 
but dealers explained the Bundesbank likely added more money to meet an expected surge in demand for cash for Thursday &apos;s regional holiday . 
&quot; Germany is still a cash-oriented country and a lot of people are running to the bank to get money for Thursday , &quot; a dealer said . 
dealers expect that this might create a wholly different picture for reserves on Friday , leaving some banks to scramble to meet the monthly requirements . 
but overall dealers were confident that month-end should be fairly smooth , with rates climbing only to around 3.10 percent . 
the majority of traders also expects the Bundesbank will keep its key interest rates unchanged at Wednesday &apos;s council meeting , scheduled one day earlier than usual to accomodate Thursday &apos;s regional holiday . 
&quot; We will get another fixed rate repo at three percent , &quot; said one dealer . 
this rate has prevailed since August . 
there will be some trading on Thursday even though Frankfurt banks will mostly be closed , dealers said , noting that since the Bundesbank will be open for electronic transactions in Frankfurt and some regional central banks will be open as well . 
but the Bundesbank said that it would not conduct any money market policies on Thursday . 
on Wednesday the Frankfurt Interbank offered Rate was set at 3.00467 percent compared with 3.24867 percent on Tuesday .
