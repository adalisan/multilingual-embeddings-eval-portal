the Israeli army said on Saturday its forces returned fire on a Lebanese village after pro-Iranian guerrillas fired mortars from the village at Israel &apos;s occupation zone inside southern Lebanon . 
the army in a statement quoted United Nations peacekeepers stationed in Lebanon as saying several Lebanese were wounded and houses were damaged by the Israeli fire . 
U.N. officials were not immediately available to comment . 
Israel said there were no casualties to its own forces or its South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) allies in the zone . 
&quot; It is now clear that the sources of the mortars that were fired ( on Friday night ) at an SLA position and Israeli forces in the Barashit area in the western sector of the security zone in south Lebanon were in the village of Tzaffed el Batih in the Tibnin area , &quot; the Israeli army statement said . 
&quot; The Hizbollah took responsibility for the fire that was a violation of the agreement reached in the Grapes of wrath operation . 
Israeli forces returned fire to sources . 
UNIFIL reports that from this fire a few civilians were injured and houses in the village have been damaged . 
Israel launched a 17-day blitz against pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas in Lebanon in April in retaliation for rocket attacks on northern Israel . 
some 200 Lebanese , mostly civilians , were killed by Israel &apos;s &quot; Grapes of wrath &quot; operation . 
the fighting ended with a U.S.-brokered set of understandings barring either side from firing from or at civilian areas . 
a committee comprised of representatives of France , Syria , Lebanon , Israel and the United States was set up to monitor observance of the ceasefire and has met several times . 
Israel set up a 15 km ( nine mile ) -wide occupation zone as a buffer against guerrilla attacks in 1985 . 
Hizbollah is fighting to oust Israel from the zone .
