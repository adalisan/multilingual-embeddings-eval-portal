the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 7,000 points for the first time Thursday , while bonds rallied after the Treasury &apos;s $ 10 billion quarterly auction . 
the dollar rose against the Japanese yen , but ended lower against the German mark as a German official voiced concern over its strength . 
the stock market rode a wave of investor confidence based on low interest rates and non-inflationary economic growth . 
the Dow ended up 60.81 points , or 0.87 percent , at an all-time high of 7,022.44 , beating the previous record set just Wednesday . 
the rally capped a breathtaking run that has added 1,000 points to the blue-chip index in just four months . 
the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s composite index also set a new high , gaining 9.05 to 811.82 . 
in the broader market , advancing issues swamped declines 1,717 to 820 on very heavy volume of 584 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
early in the session , the Dow staged a series of brief forays above 7,000 but failed to mount a serious charge until the recently dormant bond market sprang to life . 
&quot; This market is interpreting everything positively right now , &quot; said Charlie crane , director of research at Spears Benzak Salomon &amp; Farrell . 
&quot; Today , all of a sudden the bond market got its legs and pretty soon , stocks were dancing . 
the bond rally , which began just after the Treasury sold $ 10 billion in bonds in a quarterly auction , lifted the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond nearly a full point , which reduced its yield to 6.63 percent from 6.71 percent on Wednesday . 
stoking the demand for stocks was a strong dollar , analysts said , citing a variety of reasons that the currency &apos;s recent rise has lifted the market . 
&quot; The dollar &apos;s strength is diminshing fears of inflation because a strong dollar tends to lower the cost of imports , &quot; said Jack Shaughnessy , director of research at Advest . 
&quot; Clearly , inflation has always been a critical variable for the market . 
another by-product is renewed international demand for U.S. financial assets . 
while the favourable economic backdrop remained intact , stocks still needed evidence of continued corporate earnings growth to sustain their rally . 
the just-concluded wave of fourth-quarter results provided that , analysts said . 
&quot; There are two things that matter , interest rates and corporate earnings , &quot; said Phil Orlando , chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management . 
&quot; Rates are coming down and corporate earnings are still showing powerful growth . 
the dollar ended mixed as a German official voiced concern over its continuing strength and speculation emerged in London that central bankers had stepped in to sell dollars for yen . 
but traders said solid economic growth in the United States , coupled with sharp gains in U.S. stock and bond markets , sustained investors &apos; interest in the dollar . 
&quot; The bottom line is , the fundamentals look very good for the dollar , &quot; said Hans Boman , chief spot currency dealer at Swedbank in New York . 
the dollar fell to 1.6847 marks late in New York from 1.6892 late on Wednesday , but it rose to 124.40 Japanese yen from 124.25 on Wednesday . 
coffee prices rose to a 21-month high Thursday on concerns about tight supplies in South America and possible shipping problems in strikebound Colombia . 
at New York &apos;s Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange , March coffee ended up 8.20 cents at 180.05 cents a pound , its highest close in 21 months . 
March frozen concentrated orange juice futures closed 2.35 cents higher at 76.90 cents a pound at the New York Cotton Exchange , bouncing back from a steep drop on Wednesday .
