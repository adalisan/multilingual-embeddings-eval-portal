Albanian refugees living in shelters in southern Italy vowed on Monday not to return home despite an August 31 deadline for their repatriation . 
&quot; I would rather live in a tent in Italy than in a house in Albania , &quot; a young Albanian woman at a shelter in the southern port city of Bari told state television . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Sunday that authorities would enforce a deadline requiring some 10,000 Albanian refugees who poured into Italy earlier this year to leave by the end of the month . 
some 16,000 Albanians , most crammed onto rusty fishing boats , fled to Italy &apos;s southern ports in the spring after their country slid into anarchy . 
some 6,000 so-called &quot; undesirables &quot; were sent home , while the rest were given three-month visas and offered accommodation in shelters . 
Prodi said he would ask the Albanian government to help enforce the deadline , since Italian authorities were having difficulty locating around 7,000 refugees living outside shelters . 
&quot; The process is going slowly because the refugees are not participating volontarily in the repatriation programme , &quot; Prodi said . 
&quot; We have decided to ask the Albanian government to solicit respect for the deadline . 
but some refugees , who fled Albania after the collapse of shady investment schemes left scores penniless and plunged the country into violent turmoil , insisted they would not return . 
&quot; There is nothing left for us in Albania . 
it &apos;s all been burned . 
we want to help build Italy and not Albania , &quot; one man told Italian television . 
&quot; What will happen to us if we return to Albania ? 
we risk our lives . 
we ask Prodi to let us stay , &quot; said Romina , an 18-year-old woman at another Bari shelter . 
Prodi and Italian Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano are anxious for a swift repatriation of Albanian refugees , particularly since a recent spate of violence involving foreigners has led opposition parties to demand a crackdown on illegal immigration . 
clashes between rival North African drug clans in the northern city of Padua , sexual assaults involving Africans at the Adriatic resort of Rimini and the growing problem of Albanian drug and prostitution rackets have added to tensions . 
Prodi has said he will urge the parties of the centre-left ruling coalition to quickly approve a law toughening up immigration control .
