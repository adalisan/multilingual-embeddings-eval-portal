Belgium &apos;s National Accounts Office , a division of the central bank , said on Thursday the country &apos;s 1996 deficit was 3.2 percent of gross domestic product , not 3.4 percent as initially thought . 
the downward revision means the deficit conformed with the government &apos;s 1996 budget target and brings Belgium one step nearer to a goal of cutting its deficit below three percent of GDP , as required for European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) . 
Belgian Budget Minister Herman Van Rompuy said earlier this week the government was on track to reducing its 1997 deficit to around 2.9 percent of GDP , although an advisory body said on Tuesday the figure was likely to be nearer 2.8 percent . 
in its report , the National Accounts Office said Belgian GDP amounted to 8.428 billion francs in 1996 , up from 8.161 billion in 1995 .
