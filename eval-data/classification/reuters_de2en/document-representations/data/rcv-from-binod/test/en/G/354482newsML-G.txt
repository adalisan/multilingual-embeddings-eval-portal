U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Tuesday he was &quot; shocked and dismayed &quot; at the ambush killing of four U.N. human rights staff in Rwanda . 
&quot; The secretary-general was shocked and dismayed by the news this morning that four human rights observers were killed and one was wounded , &quot; his spokesman Fred Eckhard said . 
at the same time , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso strongly condemned the killings and said he had ordered human rights officers in Cyangugu , Gisenji and Kibuye areas to evacuate to Kigali . 
the order to retreat to Kigali affected some 15 of the 139 U.N. human rights officers working throughout the country to protect and promote human rights , U.N. sources said . 
Eckhard identified the dead as a Cambodian serving as a U.N. volunteer , a Briton with the U.N. field operation in Rwanda and two local Rwandanese employees . 
a fifth victim , a driver , also locally employeed , survived with a gunshot wound to the stomach , he said , adding that all were travelling in marked U.N. vehicles . 
the Rwandan government had made a helicopter avaialble to U.N. security officials who went to the scene of the attack , Eckhard said . 
the four were killed while visiting a commune of Karengera in Cyangugu preferecture , approximately 200 miles ( 350 km ) southwest of Kigali on the Zairean border . 
Ayala Lasso , currently travelling in the United States , issued his comments in a statement released in New York and Geneva where his commission is based . 
&quot; I strongly condemn this attack and offer my deepest sympathy to the families of those killed , &quot; he said . 
Ayala Lasso , a former U.N. ambassador from Ecuador , who was named to the new post three years ago , said : &quot; This is the first loss of life resulting from an attack in the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda . 
&quot; I have asked the Rwandan military to investigate the facts of this attack and take all necessary measures to punish those responsible , &quot; he added . 
&quot; These deaths demonstrate once again the urgent need to work in order to ensure respect for human rights and to establish in Rwanda a climate of peaceful relations among all communities , &quot; Ayala-Lasso said . 
Xavier Zuniga , a Mexican who heads the U.N. human rights field operation in Rwanda , as well as Omar Bakhet , resident coordinator of the U.N. Development Programme in Kigali , had arrived in Cyangugu to begin the investigation , according to the statement . 
a U.N. report issued by his Geneva office last Friday said that Hutu death squads in Rwanda were killing Tutsi survivors of genocide and witnesses who were forced to move out of isolated areas near army positions in search of security . 
more than half a million minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates died in 1994 &apos;s Hutu-led ethnic slaughter , after which Tutsis swept to power in Rwanda and the perpetrators fled to neighbouring countries . 
in total , the U.N. human rights office in Rwanda received reports of nearly 1,600 killings in 1996 . 
it gave no breakdown for killings by the Tutsi-dominated army which is fighting an insurgency by rebels of the Hutu majority .
