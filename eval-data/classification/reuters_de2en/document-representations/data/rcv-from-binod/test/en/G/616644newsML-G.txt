a senior Cambodian official said on Tuesday the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) would admit Cambodia , Burma and Laos into the grouping at the end of this year , not in July as previously expected . 
the three countries had hoped to join ASEAN at the seven-member group &apos;s ministerial meeting on July 24-25 . 
the official said the decision to expand the grouping to include all 10 Southeast Asian nations was made at a summit in 1995 and ASEAN believed it would be appropriate the three became full members at a summit to be held at the end of the year . 
&quot; It &apos;s a delay , &quot; the official said , in answer to a question about when the three would join . 
the official did not elaborate on why the decision was regarded as a delay , since ASEAN leaders had never said exactly when the three aspirants would join . 
senior officials from the group -- which comprises Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam -- are due to meet in Malaysia next weekend to wrap up plans to admit the three countries . 
a tense feud between the leaders of Cambodia &apos;s coalition government has raised doubts about whether Phnom Penh would be able to pass necessary legislation in time for ASEAN &apos;s July ministerial meeting . 
political analysts said the country &apos;s political instability had also triggered concern over Cambodia &apos;s readiness to join . 
separately , the United States has asked ASEAN to delay Burma &apos;s entry because of its human rights record and the suppression of the democracy movement lead by Aung San Suu Kyi .
