European meals and feed were offered at lower levels in early business on Thursday but many players remained nervous after Chicago &apos;s movements yesterday and there were no initial trades . 
&quot; After a move like that , when the market is nervous and hectic , we made a typical start -- quiet , &quot; one trader said . 
sellers offered soymeal around a dollar lower but failed to solicit any bids from consumers , who were still waiting for rain forecasts to take the heat out of the Chicago futures . 
other prices were mostly unchanged from Wednesday .
