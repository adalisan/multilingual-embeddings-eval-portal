Shenzhen &apos;s B share index ended Wednesday morning slightly lower on a wait-and-see mood after recent sharp rises , analysts said . 
&quot; The shrinking turnover shows that investors are putting money aside after the recent steep gains , &quot; an analyst at J &amp; A Securities said . 
the index hit 1997-highs for three straight sessions up to Monday and began a technical correction on Tuesday , analysts said . 
the J &amp; A analyst said the correction would probably last until the end of the week before the index picks up again , with investor confidence still strong . 
&quot; judging by the A shares , the B shares still have a lot of room to move up , &quot; an analyst at China Guotai Securities said . 
analysts said they expect the index to soon break through the historic high of 201.87 points , scored last December , and to maintain the gains over the Hong Kong handover in July . 
&quot; I am confident the index will challenge the 200-point level quite soon , &quot; the Guotai analyst said . 
the A share index rose 2.57 points or 0.54 percent to 475.76 on turnover of 5.59 billion yuan .
