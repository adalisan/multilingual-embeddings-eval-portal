rebel leader Laurent Kabila is intent on erasing the name of Zaire as well as ending the rule of President Mobutu Sese Seko after 32 years . 
one day after Mobutu relinquished power and abandoned the capital Kinshasa , Kabila on Saturday declared himself the new leader of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
this reverts to the name used for the former Belgian colony from 1964 until Mobutu declared in 1971 that the country should be known as Zaire . 
Africa &apos;s third-largest country was first known at independence in 1960 as the Republic of the Congo under nationalist prime minister Patrice Lumumba . 
in 1964 , a year before Mobutu took power , it was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo as the army faced two rebellions . 
Kabila &apos;s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire ( AFDL ) started the process of renaming areas of Zaire as they captured them from government forces . 
the rebels also changed the name of the mighty Zaire River back to the Congo as they swept westwards towards the capital Kinshasa . 
it is unclear how the rebels aim to avoid confusion with the neighbouring Republic of Congo , named after the same river that forms its eastern boundary with Zaire . 
the AFDL says it will also launch its own currency , the Congolese franc , to take over from the national currency which Mobutu re-baptised the Zaire . 
it has also given back provinces their pre-Mobutu names . 
Haut-Zaire under Mobutu has become Eastern province and the mineral-rich southern province of Shaba has reverted to Katanga . 
Mobutu &apos;s motives for altering nomenclature in the 1970s were complex . 
they fitted in with his drive for &quot; authenticity , &quot; a doggerel philosophy which eschewed European garments and outlawed Christian first names in favour of African ones . 
but even the word Zaire was a mispronunciation by Portuguese explorers in the 15th Century . 
when they arrived from the Atlantic at the estuary of the great river now called the Zaire or Congo , the local Kongo tribe told them it was a Nzadi . 
Nzadi however only meant &quot; river &quot; in the Kongo language .
