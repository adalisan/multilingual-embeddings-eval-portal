SIMEX Nikkei futures gave up most of their early gains on Tuesday and ended steady in a thin market as players awaited the rates decision by U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers due later in the day . 
dealers said the market had priced in a 25-basis-point hike in the Fed funds rate , but anything above that could give a boost to the dollar , and consequently the Nikkei . 
worries about the Bank of Japan following suit if the Fed raised rates have faded , as players do not expect the Japanese central bank to tighten credit before the end of the year . 
after hitting a high of 21,280 , the benchmark Nikkei 225 December contract came off to close at 21,155 against a previous settlement at 21,150 . 
volume remained low at 10,300 lots . 
&quot; There was a little early selling but it was very well absorbed . 
sentiment &apos;s still bullish , &quot; said one trader . 
he said the market was likely to trade sideways in a range of 21,050 to 21,480-21,500 in the near term . 
&quot; It &apos;s not a market to look to sell . 
it &apos;s more a market to wait to buy , &quot; he said , adding that bargain hunters were likely to buoy the index on any moves down towards 21,000 .
