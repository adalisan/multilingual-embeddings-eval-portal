South African President Nelson Mandela on Saturday dodged questions about his female companion Graca Machel , who is travelling with him on an eight-day Asian tour . 
&quot; My cultural background does not permit me to discuss this question with people young enough to be my children or grandchildren , &quot; the 78-year old Mandela said when asked if a wedding was in the offing during a press conference in Manila . 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos laughed and clapped at the question and answer . 
it was the first time Graca , the widow of former Mozambican president Somora Machel , has accompanied Mandela on a state visit . 
the South African leader will visit Brunei , Singapore and Malaysia next week . 
Mandela acknowledged last year that he and Graca were in love . 
he has said they have no plans to marry . 
Mandela formally divorced his second wife Winnie last year . 
one of the world &apos;s most popular and charismatic leaders , Mandela was accompanied by his daughter Zenani on his triumphant tour last July to Britain and France . 
since he left Winnie in 1992 , he has travelled with Zenani or grand-daughter Rochelle .
