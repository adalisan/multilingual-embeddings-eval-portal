&quot; The banks are already preparing for the December 10 tax-payment , &quot; said Budapest Bank &apos;s Sandor Tolonics . 
&quot; They expect a larger-than-average payment . 
the overnight market opened at a quote of 22.00 / 22.75 percent , then substantial money was taken up at 22.5 percent , but later the rates dropped and closed at 22.00 / 22.25 , as a large bank finished borrowing money .
