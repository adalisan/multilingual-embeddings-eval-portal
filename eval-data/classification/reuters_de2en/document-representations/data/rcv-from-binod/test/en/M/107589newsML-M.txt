lead price volatility may increase because of prohibitive recycling costs and environmental restrictions on smelter output , analysts Roskill said . 
these factors &quot; will result in market imbalances and artificial squeezes in supply , &quot; Roskill &apos;s report called The Economics of Lead 1996 said . 
Roskill said imports of lead into the Western world were unlikely to rise above current levels . 
&quot; We may even see a trend reversal , with the Western world exporting to the CIS and Eastern Europe as their economies stabilise , &quot; the report said . 
Roskill said substitution is a major threat to lead demand . 
it estimated that 70 percent of the world &apos;s lead is used in lead-acid batteries , but that intensive research to find substitutes was being carried out . 
&quot; Although none are as yet anticipated , the future emergence and commercialisation of a breakthrough in this area could have a drastic effect on lead demand , &quot; Roskill said . 
while in the medium term lead demand is expected to climb , once it begins to be replaced by substitutes in the key automobile and replacement battery sectors &quot; there will be a long and irreversible decline in the lead price , &quot; the report concluded .
