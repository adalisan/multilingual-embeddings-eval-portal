French police found the bodies of four young women on Friday buried in the sand on a beach , 10 days after they went missing during a carnival evening in the northern port of Boulogne . 
investigators said suspects had confessed to killing the young women , whose bodies were concealed at the base of a concrete blockhouse built by German forces during World War Two outside the village of Portel , near Boulogne . 
&quot; As soon as we arrived , ( the suspects ) started to talk . 
we found the bodies between two blockhouses , buried a bit in the sand , &quot; Portel mayor Laurent Feutry said . 
the women , 20 year-olds Isabelle and Peggy and 17-year-olds Audrey and Amelie , were wearing fancy carnival dresses when they disappeared late in the early hours of February 12 . 
police said they were apparently killed on the following evening . 
their surnames have not been released . 
police detained five members of one family , including three brothers , all scrap merchants , living in a village a few km ( miles ) away . 
from Bucharest , where he is on an official visit , French President Jacques Chirac sent a message of sympathy to the womens &apos; families . 
justice will be done , &quot; he said in a message broadcast by the evening television news . 
Gerald Lesigne , public prosecutor for Boulogne , said two of the brothers , Jean-Michel and Jean-Louis Jourdain , were behind the killings . 
the first brother had been sentenced to 15 years in jail for murder but was released in August 1995 . 
the second was convicted of rape and sentenced to 10 years jail , and was released in late 1994 . 
&quot; We know nothing more on the circumstances of the deaths but we can definitely say that the young women died on the evening of the carnival , &quot; Lesigne told a news conference . 
he said an autopsy was under way to determine the causes of the deaths and that a member of the womens &apos; families had put investigators on the right path . 
the brothers reportedly own a van similar to one that was reported close to the beach where the women were last seen .
