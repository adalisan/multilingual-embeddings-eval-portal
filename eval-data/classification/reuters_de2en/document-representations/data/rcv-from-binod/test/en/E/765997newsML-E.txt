the Polish government will consider introducing a special temporary tax next year to raise funds for the reconstruction of areas hit by July &apos;s catastrophic floods , Finance Minister Marek Belka said on Wednesday . 
Belka said he would prefer to impose a tax on individuals and firms , rather than to issue special tax-deductible bonds -- a measure proposed by the opposition , which the prime minister said would be taken into consideration . 
but he said the government may still opt for neither the new tax nor special bonds , if it found it was able to finance the reconstruction by reallocating spending from other areas . 
Belka told a news conference the final decision on whether the government should ask parliament to impose a tax would be taken during cabinet debates on next year &apos;s budget draft , due later this month and in September . 
he declined to unveil the size of a possible tax , but said it should bring up to two billion zlotys in revenues in 1998 . 
&quot; If I were to choose between a flood tax or a bond issue I would prefer the tax , &quot; Belka said , adding new bonds could discourage investors from buying the finance ministry &apos;s regular debt instruments . 
Belka ruled out increasing current personal income and corporate taxes . 
the floods , which devastated southwestern Poland , caused damage of up to 7.5 billion zlotys , according to independent analysts .
