Iran on Thursday rejected as biased a German court ruling that Tehran ordered the 1992 killings of four Kurdish dissidents , and withdrew its ambassador to Germany for consultations . 
foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the court verdict was unfounded and influenced by a propaganda campaign against Iran , the official Iranian IRNA news agency reported . 
Mohammadi rejected the ruling which he said had been made &quot; in an unjust and biased manner based on the false claims of counter-revolutionary elements and hostile political propaganda of the Zionists &quot; . 
he said Tehran had recalled its ambassador to Bonn , Hossein Moussavian , for consultations and was waiting for an official account of the verdict . 
in its sentence on Thursday , the court avoided citing names but gave the positions of the Iranian officials it believed were behind the murders as members of a committee which included the state president and Iran &apos;s religious leader . 
Iran &apos;s parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri , speaking in Moscow , dismissed the court verdict as political . 
Iran &apos;s ties with Germany , Tehran &apos;s main trade partner , have been strained over the German charges that spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ordered the murders . 
Iran has denied being involved . 
Iran &apos;s move came as Germany announced it was recalling its ambassador from Tehran and expelling four Iranian diplomatic staff . 
Bonn also said it was ending its policy of &quot; critical dialogue &quot; with Tehran for the foreseeable future . 
residents in the Iranian capital said dozens of riot police were posted on Thursday evening around the German embassy compound in central Tehran . 
the embassy had been closed all day even though it is usually open on Thursdays , the residents said . 
Iran has repeatedly denied all responsibility for the killings which it blames on infighting among opposition groups . 
it has condemned the trial as politically motivated , citing that a main witness was Abolhassan Banisadr -- Iran &apos;s first president who fled to France after being deposed in 1981 . 
Banisadr is accused by Tehran of hijacking and other crimes . 
foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said on Wednesday a &quot; negative &quot; verdict could damage ties with Bonn and denied reports the 500 German nationals living in Iran were at risk . 
&quot; We support human values and German nationals will have full security , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But a negative verdict ... will have a negative impact on political and economic ties between Tehran and Bonn . 
he was reacting to reports that pro-Iranian groups might attack German interests or that the lives of German nationals in Iran were under threat if the court backed charges by German prosecutors that Tehran ordered the killings . 
Velayati said Iran had good relations with Germany and drew a distinction between the court and the Bonn government . 
Germany has been Iran &apos;s most important Western ally and has resisted pressure , mainly from the United States and Britain , to shun Iran which they accuse of state terrorism , a charge Iran denies . 
Iranian analysts said they believed Iran would issue strongly worded protests against the court &apos;s ruling but doubted it would go as far as jeopardising its vital ties with Germany . 
they referred to comments by Khamenei late last year as the row broke that the United States and Israel were Iran &apos;s main enemies and disputes with other countries were secondary . 
they said the comments looked like an attempt to defuse the row . 
the court gave life sentences to Kazem Darabi , an Iranian , and Abbas Rhayel , a Lebanese . 
two other Lebanese received prison sentences of between five and 11 years as accomplices . 
it found a fifth man innocent of complicity charges . 
the German Foreign Ministry has warned Germans not to travel to Iran unless absolutely necessary and to remain in constant contact with the embassy in Tehran . 
in November , protesters marched on the embassy , pelted it with eggs and stones and called for the death of German state prosecutor Bruno Jost . 
Bonn last year issued an arrest warrant for Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan , accusing him of masterminding the murders .
