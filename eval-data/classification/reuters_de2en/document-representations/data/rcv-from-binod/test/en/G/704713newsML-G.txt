they may not vote for political parties like adults , but Mexican children will fill out a ballot for the first time in Sunday &apos;s elections . 
about eight million six to 12-year-olds are expected to go to the polls to pick one of a list of human rights they deem most important . 
&quot; The children are going to participate because they want to try out their vote to make their opinions known , &quot; said 10-year-old Sandra Jimenez , a wheelchair-bound participant of the United Nations Children &apos;s Fund ( Unicef ) programme in Mexico . 
the rights the children will choose from include health , freedom of speech and living in peace with caring people . 
some 52 million Mexicans are registered to vote on Sunday to choose 500 federal deputies , 32 of 128 senators , governors in six states , and for the first time in modern history , the mayor of Mexico City . 
UNICEF and the independent Federal Electoral Institute ( IFE ) , the country &apos;s main electoral body , decided to take advantage of the voting to organise a nationwide election for children . 
&quot; From the surveys we &apos;ve done , the children are very interested , &quot; Unicef project coordinator Rafael Enriquez said . 
the adult elections should also prove to be interesting . 
according to opinion polls , they are expected to deal the worst ever defeat to the Institutional Revolutionary Party , that has ruled Mexico for 68 years . 
the youngsters can vote in 9,000 polls installed in parks , schools , health centres , sports sites , museums and malls across the country . 
children between 13 and 18 years old will monitor the elections .
