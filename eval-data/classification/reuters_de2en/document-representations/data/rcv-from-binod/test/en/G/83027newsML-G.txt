Alex Zuelle looks set to celebrate his first Tour of Spain win by heading an all-Swiss trio on to the winner &apos;s podium on Sunday after following home compatriot Tony Rominger in Saturday &apos;s time-trial . 
Rominger &apos;s win moved him ahead of Italy &apos;s Roberto Pistore into third place in the overall standings , two minutes behind fellow Swiss Laurent Dufaux who retained second place behind Zuelle . 
Sunday &apos;s final stage over 165 kms , starting and ending in Madrid , is over mainly flat terrain and expected to finish in a sprint . 
Rominger won the stage from Zuelle by 13 seconds , with Dufaux finishing fifth , over two minutes back in provisional timings . 
it was Rominger &apos;s second time-trial win of the Vuelta and a splendid achievement for a man who seemed to have dropped out of contention after a poor third stage . 
the stage also marked the return to form of Laurent Jalabert , who fell from second to 20th place overall earlier in the week after suffering a stomach upset . 
Jalabert came in third , one minute 47 seconds behind Rominger in provisional timings .
