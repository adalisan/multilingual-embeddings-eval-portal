a hawkish Bank of England inflation report shocked economists and knocked the stuffing out of sterling , fresh from its trip to two-and-a-half highs . 
the pound was already retreating from its early high of 2.5137 marks , but the Bank &apos;s assertion that another rate rise was probably needed as the the government was unlikely to meet its inflation goal sent it all the way back to near 2.4950 . 
&quot; To an extent it &apos;s a knee-jerk reaction -- what really matters for sterling is the outlook for interest rates relative to the rest of the world , &quot; said Adam Cole at HSBC James Capel . 
&quot; Looking at the short sterling curve , interest rate expectations have shifted up a notch further . 
that &apos;s what will turn out to dominate the outlook for sterling in the slightly longer term , &quot; said Cole , who is UK economist at Capel in London . 
analysts professed surprise at the Bank of England &apos;s tough line , coming as it did just a week after the UK unexpectedly raised official interest rates by a quarter-point . 
the Bank said the short-run rise in inflation reduced the chance of bringing it below the government &apos;s target of 2.5 percent in 1997 . 
inflation could rise above three percent in the next month or so , BOE chief economist Mervyn King said . 
the central bank also raised eyebrows with its contention that sterling &apos;s current strength is likely to remain temporary and has no implications for inflation in the medium term . 
King said the UK unit &apos;s rise is no substitute for higher interest rates , implicitly rejecting the old rule of thumb that a four-percent sterling appreciation has the same impact as a one-point monetary tightening . 
Stuart Weatherby , UK economist at Panmure Gordon here , said sterling had reacted badly to the suggestion that inflation was set to go higher . 
&quot; But I wouldn &apos;t see this as a major setback for the currency market , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think the BOE &apos;s trying to put pressure on the Chancellor and if anything inflation towards the end of the year may start going better , given the sterling strength we &apos;ve seen , &quot; he added . 
sterling was quoted at 2.4925 / 35 marks by 1303 GMT , down from late Tuesday &apos;s European level of 2.5026 / 31 and over two pfennigs below its session high . 
dollar / mark &apos;s retreat after rallying on the U.S. election results did the pound no favours . 
against the dollar , sterling fell to $ 1.6410 / 20 from yesterday &apos;s close here of $ 1.6447 / 52 . 
chart analysts had begun the day talking of a push through 2.52 marks , to open 2.53 and an eventual target of 2.60 . 
but while the pound &apos;s late-morning price action appeared to drive that move off the agenda , analysts remained upbeat . 
&quot; A reminder that the UK is in a tightening cycle should make for a positive medium-term backdrop to the pound -- 2.55 marks is still favoured soon , &quot; said Jeremy Hawkins , chief economic adviser at Bank of America here . 
with the Bank of England &apos;s report widely interpreted as an appeal to Chancellor Kenneth Clarke for a fiscally prudent budget on November 26 , analysts noted the newly-revealed 13.3 percent October jump in UK car registrations . 
that , they said , was yet another indicator of strong consumer demand here . 
the European Union also spoke out on the UK budget , with European Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy saying the next budget could trim the 1997 deficit-to-GDP ratio to 3.0 percent , thus meeting the Maastricht criterion for a single currency . 
that followed a European Commission forecast that the ratio would be 3.5 percent next year , making the UK , Italy and Greece the only three of the 15 EU states to miss the Maastricht goal . 
de Silguy told reporters the Commission forecast had been calculated without knowledge of the UK &apos;s next budget plans .
