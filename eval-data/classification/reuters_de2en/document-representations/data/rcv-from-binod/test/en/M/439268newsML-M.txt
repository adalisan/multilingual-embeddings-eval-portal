Mexico peso contracts retained early weakness to straddle the key eight-per-dollar mark at the close of trade Thursday . 
traders said the U.S. House of Representatives vote on decertification of Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs and rising U.S. long bond yields hit the peso . 
&quot; The market opted to trade on ( U.S. ) long bond movements and speculation triggered by the certification process , &quot; a trader said . 
the benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate ended the session 3.5 and 2.7 centavos weaker , respectively , at 8.000 / 8.0050 and 7.9880 / 7.9930 per dollar . 
the House of Representatives debate on decertifying Mexico &apos;s efforts to fight drug-trafficking was still under way when trading closed in Mexico &apos;s foreign exchange markets . 
&quot; The market was edgy and we feel the peso could slide further on Friday , &quot; another trader said . 
subsequently , the House voted to give Mexico 90 days to improve its performance in fighting the drug trade . 
yields on 30-year Treasury bonds were up to 6.98 percent when foreign exchange trading closed in Mexico , from 6.93 percent in early trade . 
dealers said strong retail sales data triggered a sell-off in the U.S. bond market . 
&quot; I feel the market is still a little short ( dollars ) , so that will stop the peso firming for a few days , &quot; a third trader said . 
same-day peso contracts had closed earlier 3.1 centavos weaker at 7.9810 / 7.9850 per dollar .
