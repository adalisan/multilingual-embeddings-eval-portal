the European Commission of Human Rights on Friday threw out a plea against Bonn by the former head of communist East Germany &apos;s secret police , Erich Mielke , officials said . 
Mielke , 89 , was appealing against a six-year prison sentence handed down in 1993 for killing two policemen in 1931 while he was a communist street fighter . 
Mielke , whom East Germans dubbed &quot; The Master of Fear &quot; when he was head of the Ministry for State Security ( Stasi ) , was released from jail for health reasons in 1995 , having served two thirds of the prison sentence . 
Mielke argued before the Strasbourg-based Commission that his human rights had been violated because the gap between the alleged offence and his trial exceeded the statute of limitations . 
the Commission , which sorts out applications before they go to the European Court of Human Rights , rejected his plea . 
it said judicial procedures revived in 1947 when an arrest warrant was sent to authorities in the Soviet-occupied zone conformed with German law .
