Slovenian shares shed 0.53 percent on Tuesday to take their losing streak to seven sessions in a row as participants continued to stay away from the market . 
&quot; There is no activity on the market as traders wait for banks to clarify what will be their exact demands concerning custody accounts , &quot; said Branko Miklavic , a trader at SKB . 
two weeks ago the central bank said that international investors must open special custody accounts at one of 14 fully licensed Slovenian banks in order to trade in the country &apos;s securities . 
the move triggered a rash of selling from foreign investors , pummelling the blue-chip index down 21.8 percent in three days . 
traders said market sentiment at present was one of uncertainty as banks have not specified how much it would cost to open a custody account . 
overall nine shares fell , two rose and four were unchanged , while another 11 were untraded . 
turnover rose to 176.7 million tolars from 107.2 million tolars .
