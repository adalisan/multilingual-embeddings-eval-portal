the National Association of Purchasing Managers said Tuesday it expects economic growth to pick up in the second half of this year , but it saw scant signs of price pressures . 
&quot; Purchasing executives report a higher level of optimism for the coming year than they did a year ago , &quot; Norbert Ore , chairman of the association &apos;s business survey committee , said . 
purchasers surveyed in NAPM &apos;s semi-annual forecast expressed little concern over possible increased materials costs . 
prices paid for materials fell during the first four months of 1997 by 0.2 percent and are expected to increase by 0.7 percent for the year as a whole . 
overall Labor and benefit costs are expected to rise 2.4 percent , the survey said . 
purchasers predict modest growth in their imports and exports with the latter growing more rapidly than the former . 
they also expect the dollar to continue to strengthen . 
&quot; Purchasing executives are slightly more optimistic concerning the prospective strength of the U.S. dollar in 1997 ... than they were in December 1996 , &quot; the survey said . 
the survey forecast that manufacturing employment will increase in 1997 , with 30 percent expecting to add workers . 
this compared to the 26 percent who predicted higher employment in 1997 in the December forecast . 
nearly half of the executives expect no change in their workforce . 
capital expenditures are expected to increase by 10.1 percent in 1997 . 
production capacity in manufacturing is expected to increase 4.9 percent . 
purchasers report operating at 86.4 percent of their capacity , down slightly from 86.8 percent in December , the survey said . 
the major economic concerns of purchasing managers are rising interest rates , Labor costs , inflation , the economy and a strong dollar .
