the UAE &apos;s economy grew nine percent in 1996 and the non-oil sector boosted its contribution to the country &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a minister said in remarks published on Sunday . 
Al-Khaleej daily quoted Minister of State for Finance and Industrial Affairs Ahmed bin Humaid al-Tayer as saying GDP grew nine percent . 
it did not specify whether he was referring to nominal or real growth . 
official estimates put inflation at between four and five percent but economists say it runs as high as 12 percent . 
like its Gulf Arab neighbours , the United Arab Emirates wants to diversify its economy to reduce vulnerability to fluctuations in world oil prices .
