the planned flotation of motor racing &apos;s Formula One Holdings is likely to be delayed until September , sources close to the discussions said on Friday . 
the sources said a final decision on whether to press on with a flotation in July would not be taken until early next week . 
but the chances of a postponement until September were rated as &quot; fairly high &quot; . 
formula One Holdings , controlled by Bernie Ecclestone , runs the commercial side of the world motor racing championship and sells television rights to the annual round of grand Prix races . 
the business is likely to attract an overall valuation of 1.5 billion pounds ( $ 2.4 billion ) or more . 
however , there have been complications over the division of revenue between the teams and a floated Formula One business . 
a delay would also allow bankers and financial advisers longer to market the sale of a unique business .
