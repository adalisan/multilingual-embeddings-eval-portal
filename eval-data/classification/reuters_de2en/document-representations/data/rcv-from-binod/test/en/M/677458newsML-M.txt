the dollar extended its gains against the yen from overnight levels by late Tokyo trade on Friday , lifted by short-covering as concerns eased that U.S.-Japan trade friction would boost the yen , dealers said . 
they added , however , that persistent selling pressure from Japanese exporters and others remained in place , keeping the dollar from reaching 115 yen . 
&quot; Political pressure on the yen eased after remarks by President Clinton and this has pushed the dollar / yen up , but commercial selling pressure remained , &quot; said a senior dealer at a Japanese bank . 
in a White House interview recorded for Japanese television before departing on Thursday for the Denver summit , Clinton said he was concerned about Japan &apos;s large surplus with the United States but added that exchange rates should not be used as way to correct trade imbalances . 
the U.S. and Japan unveiled on Thursday a formal consultive process in which they would discuss deregulation of key sectors of Japan &apos;s economy . 
&quot; The prime minister through this agreement has invited the United States to participate in helping Japan formulate deregulation initiatives , &quot; said U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky . 
the news prompted a slew of short-covering overnight and also prompted unwinding of hedge sell positions by Japanese trust banks here , dealers said . 
dealers &apos; focus on the Group of Seven ( G7 ) nations &apos; summit later in the day lessened after Clinton &apos;s remarks , with some saying that anything surprising was unlikely to come out of the summit . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the issue of Japan &apos;s trade surplus will be discussed intensively at the summit , &quot; a city bank dealer said . 
some dealers said focus had shifted to the results of the &quot; tankan &quot; , the Bank of Japan &apos;s quarterly survey of corporate sentiment , on June 25 . 
but others remained cautious ahead of the summit and demand for dollar put options stayed strong . 
the dollar / yen risk reversal for one month , which shows the pricing differential between puts and calls , favoured dollar puts at around 2.0 / 2.5 percent on Friday , unchanged from Thursday . 
it was the highest level since in April 1995 , when the dollar sank to its post-war record low of below 79.75 yen . 
&quot; People are expecting less emphasis will be placed on the ( U.S.-Japan ) trade surplus . 
if the G7 doesn &apos;t say anything conclusive , I think dollar / yen will be still bid , &quot; said a dealer in Singapore . 
dealers in Singapore said activity was driven by the mark / yen cross , but trading was confined to a narrow range . 
the mark failed to remain firm after stop-loss mark buying orders at around 66.50 yen briefly pushed it up , Tokyo dealers said . 
the dollar closed at 114.06 / 11 yen in New York on Thursday .
