Pakistani rice export prices are likely to be mixed next week amid reports that rain and hot weather in Punjab province has affected the quality of IRRI-6 variety , dealers said on Thursday . 
IRRI-6 prices , which firmed on exporter demand last week , have since dipped with exporters unable to buy quality stocks , dealer Khalid Ghori of Matco Rice Processing Mills said . 
&quot; Recent rain and excessive heat that followed the rain has damaged the quality of IRRI-6 . 
but prices did not fall sharply as there is a lot of international demand , &quot; Ghori said . 
he said a rising trend in U.S. rice futures sparked by fears that adverse weather could cut the world rice crop , particularly in India , had also helped to prop up prices . 
exporters said Pakistan &apos;s overall rice crop was under no immediate weather threat as sowing had been completed in April / May and the harvest was not due until September / October . 
Ghori said demand for basmati super from some African and Gulf Arab countries was encouraging and had pushed up prices . 
Pakistan exported 1.603 million tonnes of rice worth $ 431 million in the first 11 months of 1996 / 97 ( July-June ) , compared to 1.253 million worth $ 411 million in the same year-ago period . 
in May , rice exports fell to 124,338 tonnes worth $ 37 million compared to 185,349 tonnes worth $ 48 million in April and 119,565 tonnes worth $ 38 million in May 1996 .
