suspected tribal militants defied an army crackdown on Wednesday and blew up a railway bridge in the same region of northeastern India where two blasts tore through a packed passenger train this week . 
police said the explosion destroyed a small railway bridge about 160 km ( 100 miles ) northeast of the spot where dozens of train passengers were killed on Monday in explosions that wrecked the Delhi-bound Brahmaputra Mail train . 
no one was injured in Wednesday &apos;s explosion , which occurred in the early morning between Goreswar and Khoivabari towns , about 70 km ( 45 miles ) west of Assam state &apos;s biggest city , Guwahati , they said . 
a police spokesman in Kokrajhar , near the site of Monday &apos;s blasts , said Bodo tribal guerrillas were believed to have carried out both attacks . 
the latest explosion severed a key railway link to northeastern tea and oil-rich Assam and marked the third attack in four days by suspected Bodo guerrillas . 
Monday &apos;s blasts cut the main rail line between northeastern India and the rest of the country , while an earlier attack on Sunday , also attributed to Bodo militants , had destroyed a bridge on a national highway , severing the main road link . 
railway officials said they expected the main rail line to be restored later on Wednesday . 
Bodos are calling for a separate province to be carved out of Assam , north of the Brahmaputra River . 
Monday &apos;s attack in Sensapani town was blamed on the Bodoland Liberation Tigers Force ( BLTF ) , a hardline fringe group seeking a separate Bodo nation .

&quot; Most of the boys went underground after the bomb blast , &quot; said a Bodo woman in Kokrajhar , referring to local militants . 
the latest attack came despite an army hunt for the Bodos . 
&quot; We are launching a major offensive against the separatist rebels , &quot; Brigadier K. Khare , in charge of regional army operations , told Reuters . 
&quot; We expect some encounters and explosions by separatists rebels . 
we are prepared to face this , &quot; he said . 
Khare did not disclose any details of the combing operation . 
there was continuing confusion over how many people were killed in the attack on the train , which was packed with passengers heading off for New Year holidays . 
in the hours after the train attack , authorities in Guwahati said they believed at least 300 passengers had died . 
after rescue teams reached the spot , officials dramatically revised the toll . 
S. Thadou , a senior administrator in the Kokrajhar district administration , told Reuters that there were 33 dead and 63 injured , including 22 seriously . 
but local officials said the official death toll did not take into account at least two dozen bodies that were pulled from the wreckage shortly after the blasts . 
an army official who asked not to be named said the mutilated condition of many of the victims compounded confusion . 
&quot; It &apos;s all flesh and one can &apos;t distinguish bodies , &quot; he said . 
he said army officials suspected many more people had died , and the final toll might not be known until much later .
