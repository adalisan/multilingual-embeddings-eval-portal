North Korea on Wednesday halted government-level telephone contacts with South Korea at the border village of Panmunjom , but Seoul officials shrugged off the move as a &quot; propaganda ploy &quot; . 
the officials said an announcement by North Korea on Tuesday that it would temporarily abandon the liaison offices at Panmunjom would not change Seoul &apos;s tough stand over the incursion of a North Korean submarine in September . 
North and South Korea set up the offices in 1992 as a gesture of reconciliation during a rare blossoming of goodwill between the Cold War rivals . 
&quot; Our side telephoned the North Korean liaison office for a daily test as usual but the northern side did not respond , &quot; an official at the National Unification Ministry said . 
&quot; The Panmunjom offices have virtually stopped all functions since Kim Il-Sung died in July 1994 but there had been telephone contacts for test twice a day , &quot; he said . 
North Korea has avoided government-level meetings with South Korea since Seoul banned mourning for Kim Il-Sung , the founder and deified &quot; Great Leader &quot; of the communist North . 
Pyongyang &apos;s official Korean Central News Agency said on Tuesday the North would temporarily abandon its liaison offices from Wednesday in response to remarks by South Korean President Kim Young-sam that Seoul had shut the door on dialogue between the two countries . 
it said Kim had ruled out dialogue with the North in an interview with the Washington Post newspaper . 
the liaison offices were set up to promote contacts , including cultural and government exchanges and family reunions , after the prime ministers of the two sides signed a treaty that included a non-aggression agreement . 
Panmunjom is the only crossing point along the heavily fortified demilitarized Zone that sealed the division of the Korean peninsula after the 1950-53 Korean War . 
&quot; North Korea is trying to pass the buck to South Korea for the current tense relations and the failure of dialogue between the two Koreas , &quot; a senior Seoul government official said . 
&quot; The North Korean move is a sheer propaganda ploy aimed at misleading the world and avoid criticism caused by the submarine incursion , &quot; the official said . 
tense relations between the two Koreas have worsened since a North Korean submarine landed 26 agents on a South Korean beach in September . 
twenty-four of them were shot dead , one was captured alive and another is still at large . 
Pyongyang insists the incident was an accident and demands the return of the bodies and the captured agent . 
Seoul says it will suspend all assistance to North Korea , including financing for nuclear plants , until Pyongyang &quot; clearly apologises &quot; for the submarine incident and guarantees such an incident will not be repeated . 
under a landmark agreement with the United States in 1994 , North Korea agreed to freeze a suspected nuclear arms programme in return for a promise to provide light-water nuclear plants and interim energy . 
&quot; We cannot go ahead with the nuclear project unless North Korea ends hostile activities towards us , &quot; a South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said . 
South Korea , a key member of the Korean peninsula Energy Development Organisation in charge of installing new reactors in the North , has agreed to foot the major portion of the bill for the project .
