Indonesian palm olein prices were steady in late trading on Monday , boosted by relatively high crude palm oil prices and gains in Malaysia , traders said . 
they said palm olein was quoted at 1,430-35 rupiah / kg in Jakarta , unchanged from the opening but higher than last Friday &apos;s close of 1,410-15 rupiah , but offers were also heard at 1,440 rupiah . 
crude palm oil was last done at around 1,245 rupiah in the North Sumatran city of Medan last week . 
&quot; Palm olein is adjusting to crude palm oil prices , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Healthy increases in Malaysia in fairly active trading also helped boost sentiment . 
the traders said palm olein prices were also steady in the Java towns of Semarang and Surabaya on good demand and talk of supply tightness . 
&quot; The Semarang and Surabaya markets are more active than Jakarta , &quot; one trader said . 
there was also speculation that the state-run Joint Marketing Board , which markets all crude palm oil produced by state plantations , had delayed the shipment of some of its exports . 
an agency official said shipments were being &quot; adjusted &quot; but declined further comment . 
traders said there had been delays in the agency &apos;s allocation of crude palm oil to local players . 
&quot; I have been hearing that some local players had paid for their allocation but had yet to obtain their crude palm oil , &quot; one trader said . 
data from Belawan Port showed that the MT Bina left the port on Saturday for Cilacap with 2,000 tonnes of olein .
