Millfeed sales to catfish farms in the Southeast were fairly active but were slow elsehwere in the U.S. , dealers said . 
Feedmixers appeared to be reviewing prices and supply needs for the week , dealers said . 
in many locations millfeeds had stiff competition from green pastures , hominy , and gluten feed . 
&quot; The business slowed down because it warmed up and the grass started growing , &quot; a Texas dealer said . 
in the Carolinas , supplies of hominy , a popular feed for dairy cows , were ample as dairies turned cows onto pastures . 
buffalo sources said prices were steady to weak there despite reduced flour mill run times , as dealers want to keep millfeed competitive with other feed ingredients . 
&quot; We want to keep millfeeds in the rations , &quot; a dealer said .
