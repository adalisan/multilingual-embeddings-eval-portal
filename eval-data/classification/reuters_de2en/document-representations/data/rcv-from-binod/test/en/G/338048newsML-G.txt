accused Nazi collaborator and French ex-cabinet minister Maurice Papon said in an explosive television interview on Tuesday he would tell his trial that Jews drew up lists of co-religionists for German gas chambers . 
&quot; If it is the trial of Vichy , then the full trial must take place and there will be no avoiding the role of the General Union of French Jews , UGIF , who were auxiliaries ... and took part -- under threat of course -- in these operations . 
&quot; I know a leader of CRIF ( the present-day leadership group of French Jewry ) , or of a similar group , whose role at Drancy ( a holding camp in France ) was to select those Jews who stayed in Drancy and those who were to be deported to Germany , &quot; Papon told TF-1 television . 
the unscheduled interview with Papon , who has not appeared in public for several years , came after the French Supreme Court ordered him last week to stand trial on charges of crimes against humanity for deporting 1,560 Jews , including many children , to Nazi death camps in 1942-44 . 
Papon was then secretary-general of the Bordeaux prefect &apos;s office under the collaborationist Vichy regime . 
his trial by jury in a Bordeaux Assize court , after a legal marathon of more than 15 years , will probably be France &apos;s last chance to put wartime Nazi collaboration in the dock . 
Papon , 86 but still highly lucid , fought back furiously against the accusations , which he denied while making clear he would defend himself tooth and nail at his trial . 
the issue of UGIF remains highly sensitive among French Jews who are still divided about the body ordered created by the Nazis as a replica of the &quot; Jewish Councils &quot; formed in occupied East European countries . 
UGIF was presided over by respected community leaders , and its defenders recall that its first two presidents and many other officials themselves went to the gas chambers with their families . 
they say UGIF fed tens of thousands of Jews made penniless by Nazi seizures of bank accounts and property and saved thousands of children by placing them with non-Jewish families who hid them through the war . 
but critics say UGIF helped the Germans by its very existence and recall , as Papon did , that deportation lists at Drancy were indeed sometimes left to senior inmates to draw up . 
Papon &apos;s interview was recorded earlier in the day and aired during a live programme which the ex-minister &apos;s lawyers ordered him not to attend for fear of assassination . 
Nazi hunter Arno Klarsfeld , present at the live programme said he was outraged by Papon &apos;s accusation , saying Jews who drew up lists &quot; had a knife to their throats whereas the only knife Papon had was that with which he sliced cake when serving tea to German officers in his office . 
in the acrimonious interview , journalist Paul Amar sought to have Papon look at photos of two sisters , aged five and two , he is accused of ordering brought back from a hiding place to be handed to the Germans . 
&quot; Monsieur Amar , what you are doing is showing off for your viewers , &quot; Papon said , pushing the photos aside and saying he brought the girls back because their arrested parents asked to be reunited with them whatever lay ahead . 
Amar read an internal Nazi report of January 1943 describing Papon as a willing collaborator while Papon read a German report of later the same year accusing him of being pro-American . 
Papon insists he was a member of the Resistance and stayed at his post at the request of his underground leaders . 
much of the trial is expected to centre on the issue of Vichy officials who changed sides as the tide of war changed , accusations made in the past against the late president Francois Mitterrand . 
Papon denied all guilt . 
he said orders he signed asking French police to handle arrests were made at the request of Bordeaux &apos;s chief rabbi who thought French policemen would be less harsh than German troops in such cases . 
Papon said in the interview that unnamed foreign forces seeking to have France share blame with Germany for wartime atrocities were behind the campaign against him . 
asked who these forces were , he replied : &quot; Ask New York . 
his wartime record unknown , Papon enjoyed a meteoric post-war career , serving as Paris police chief in the 1960s and then as budget minister in the 1970s until files documenting his arrests and deportation orders were found in 1981 .
