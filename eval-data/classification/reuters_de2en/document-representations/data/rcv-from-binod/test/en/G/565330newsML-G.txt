a soccer fan who led racist chants during a match in the northeastern Italian town of Padua has been banned from attending matches for the next five years , police said on Wednesday . 
the city &apos;s police chief imposed the ban on the 21-year-old supporter of second division side Padova after racist abuse was shouted at black players during a match last weekend against Cesena . 
racist slogans were also daubed on the walls of the club &apos;s headquarters last month after a home match against Brescia . 
police would not name the fan , citing security reasons .
