very large crude carrier rates on the key Mideast / Japan route fell on Wednesday in the face of looming refinery maintenance programmes in Asia , brokers said . 
&quot; It &apos;s all down to Japanese maintenance in June and July . 
people are fighting to get anything to lay their hands on , &quot; one broker said . 
Mideast / Japan rates fell to W50 from W55 , with voyages westwards and to Singapore dipping to the same level from W52.5. 
another broker said there were many Japanese re-lets in the first half of May that would take cargoes to Japan and South Korea , &quot; so there &apos;s not much left for us . 
West Africa / U.S. 
Gulf VLCCs also edged down to about W70 from W72.5. 
meanwhile , BP Shipping said it was adding two VLCCs to its fleet , the 300,000 dwt sister ships Elisabeth Maersk and Emma Maersk which it is bareboat chartering from A.P. 
Moller of Copenhagen . 
the two 1993-built double-hulled tankers replace a number of single-hulled time charters scheduled for redelivery to their owners . 
the charters will begin in May , when the vessels will be transferred to the Isle of Man flag and be renamed , BP said . 
it gave no financial details . 
the Mediterranean market was quiet , with 130,000 tonne vessels ( Suezmaxes ) still at W95 and 80,000 tonners ( Aframaxes ) at W125 . 
the inter-U.K. / CONT sector was slightly softer at W97.5. 
&quot; There were six or seven offers for one ship . 
it &apos;s very difficult to compete with a 20-year-old vessel when a five-year-old ship can get the same rate . 
it &apos;s a charterer &apos;s market , &quot; one broker said . 
fuel oil remained in the doldrums , with 25,000 tonnes inter-UKC flat at W180 and cross-Med at W195 . 
brokers Simpson Spence &amp; Young said in their Annual Shipping Outlook that although most sectors looked bullish in 1997 , fuel oil &quot; may see another year of weak charter markets -- due to increased use of natural gas in power generation and lower imports by South European countries . 
Caribs / upcoast rates were little changed at a historically high W230 for 70,000 tonne crude cargoes and W175 for 50,000 tonnes of gas oil .
