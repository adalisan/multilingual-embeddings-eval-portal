Malaysian stocks were unmoved on Wednesday by the Thai baht &apos;s flotation as players took their cue from the stable ringgit , analysts said . 
the Thai decision had been largely expected and was hailed as positive for regional markets despite the immediate sharp fall in the baht against the dollar , they said . 
at about 0340 GMT , the key Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange &apos;s composite Index was up 1.38 points at 1,080.28 , continuing the lukewarm trading seen in recent weeks . 
the focus remained on a clutch of speculative issues with big-capitalised stocks taking a back seat . 
the ringgit slipped against the dollar in early morning trading but quickly recovered on the central Bank Negara &apos;s intervention , dealers said . 
hedge funds can only make money if people don &apos;t expect them to come in , &quot; said Phuah Lee Kerk , head of research at Jupiter Securities . 
&quot; I think Bank Negara has sharpened its knife , waiting for them to come in , &quot; he added . 
at about 0355 GMT , the ringgit was at 2.5229 / 34 to the dollar , up from its lowest level of 2.5250 in the morning when Bank Negara intervened . 
analysts said Malaysia was not being attacked by speculators as the Malaysian economy was on a firmer footing than Thailand &apos;s . 
&quot; Malaysian fundamentals are much more superior . 
it &apos;s stronger even when compared to Indonesia and the Philippines &quot; . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the float will spill over into the region , &quot; said ng Bok Eng , regional economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
said Hugh Young , managing director at Aberdeen Asset Managers in Singapore : &quot; In itself , it ( the baht flotation ) is not going to have any effect . 
but it does highlight the growing-up in general for the region .
