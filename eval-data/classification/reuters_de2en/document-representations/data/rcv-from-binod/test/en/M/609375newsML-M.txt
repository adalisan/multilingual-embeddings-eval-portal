the dollar ended a volatile week on a quiet note , closing lightly mixed against other major currencies in thin , pre-holiday trade , dealers said . 
a looming three-day holiday weekend in the two largest foreign exchange markets -- the United States and Britain -- and an early Friday close in most U.S. asset and derivative markets subdued trade volume and activity , dealers said . 
the dollar inched lower to 115.60 / 70 by the close from 115.68 / 73 at the open and ended nearly flat at 1.6925 / 35 marks from 1.6924 / 27 . 
the dollar showed little reaction to remarks overnight from Japanese Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara , who was interviewed by French newspaper Le Monde . 
Sakakibara said that a rise in Japan &apos;s discount rate should be expected by the end of the year . 
&quot; The discount rate is currently very low . 
if it rises by 0.5 percent , it will be at 1.0 percent , which remains low . 
a move on such a scale should be expected in the coming year , &quot; he said . 
he also noted , however , that he did not believe the Bank of Japan would raise rates before it was sure of a solid economic upturn . 
sung won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp , agreed with Sakakibara and said he expects official Japanese interest rates to be hiked sometime this summer . 
&quot; Economic growth is clearly gaining some momentum . 
economic conditions are better than a lot of people realize in Japan right now and that should lead to higher interest rates , &quot; he said . 
the first round of French parliamentary elections take place this weekend . 
analysts said victory for the ruling centre-right coalition -- the expected outcome -- would bolster the dollar against the mark as the French franc should respond favorably . 
but a left-wing win could hurt the U.S. unit as dealers buy marks . 
&quot; With the French elections this weekend , there is some anticipation that there may be a risk that the Socialists will get in . 
people have bought short-dated options that give them the right to own marks , &quot; said Russell LaScala , chief dealer at Citibank . 
&quot; It &apos;s a good risk-reward , low premium , high return option , &quot; he added . 
elsewhere , the dollar fell to 1.4028 / 38 Swiss francs from 1.4070 / 80 francs and the British pound recovered from Thursday &apos;s sell-off to end higher at $ 1.6342 / 52 from $ 1.6305 / 15 .
