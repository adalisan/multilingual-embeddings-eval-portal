recent moves in Japanese stocks , currencies and interest rates are due to changes in the markets &apos; outlook for the Japanese economy and problems in Japan &apos;s financial system , Yasuo Matsushita , governor of the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) , told a news conference on Wednesday . 
Matsushita said that the yen , long-term interest rates and stock prices have generally rebounded to about the same levels seen at the end of last year . 
&quot; I think the changes in the markets &apos; views on ( Japan &apos;s ) economic outlook and financial system problems are affecting these ( market movements ) &quot; , he said . 
asked about the impact of these market moves on the domestic economy , Matsushita said this would depend on the reasons behind the market movements , and it was hard to make clear predictions . 
&quot; We would like to keep careful watch over the overall economy , including the impact of the movements in markets on the economy . 
we will also keep a close watch over market movements , &quot; he said . 
international monetary authorities agree they should work to prevent excessive fluctuations that cause confusion in the foreign exchange market , Matsushita said . 
the authorities also agree that it is not appropriate for currencies to deviate from economic fundamentals , and they base their policies on this precept , he added . 
Matsushita added that when the BOJ conducted inspections of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank ( DKB ) in 1991 , DKB did not submit materials concerning loans to an individual recently arrested on suspicion of commercial code violations . 
&quot; I cannot exclude the possibility that DKB may have intentionally refrained from submitting these materials to avert our inspection , &quot; Matsushita said . 
during the latest BOJ inspection of DKB in January this year , materials concerning the loans to the recently arrested individual were submitted to the BOJ , but the central bank had no basis on which to judge the borrower &apos;s background , he said . 
&quot; We were not in a position to know the borrower &apos;s links to racketeers , so we were not aware whether the loans were made to racketeers , &quot; he said . 
at that point , however , the loans made to the borrower were already turning sour , so the BOJ told DKB to dispose of them quickly , Matsushita said . 
he also said that the central bank had instructed DKB to submit a report on the loans by the end of this month . 
Matsushita said he would like to gather the facts and consider what steps the central bank should take to prevent such incidents from recurring . 
he said he would like to make a decision on steps to be taken in response to the DKB case after reviewing the contents of DKB &apos;s report due later this month . 
regarding recently failed Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co , Matsushita said he hoped that the concerned parties would soon be able to come up with a scheme to wind up the firm . 
he expressed hope that , because insurance firms are not part of the settlement system , Nissan Life &apos;s problems would have a limited impact on the overall financial system .
