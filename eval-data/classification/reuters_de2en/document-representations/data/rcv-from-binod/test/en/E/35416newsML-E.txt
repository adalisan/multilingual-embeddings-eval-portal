the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said on Thursday it saw Germany &apos;s economy turning up in the second half of 1996 and recovering into 1997 thanks to improving exports . 
the 27-member group , which represents the world &apos;s industrialised nations , warned Bonn that it would have to push through all its intended austerity measures if it were to ensure Germany met the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s budget deficit criterion for the single European currency . 
the OECD said in its annual report on Germany : &quot; The combination of wage restraint and depreciation of the deutschemark should improve the profitability and competitiveness of German exports in the near term , although cost pressures on exports remain intense . 
the report was written in July , however , before the latest appreciation in the mark &apos;s value . 
it predicted gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth of 0.5 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 1997 , similar to the forecasts it made in June . 
like other forecasters , it had not expected such a severe slowdown at the turn of the year . 
the OECD &apos;s German representative Dieter Menke told reporters , however , that the 1996 forecast was likely to be revised upward in the autumn in the wake of stronger than expected second quarter GDP figures which came out on Thursday . 
the projection would probably now be a rise of between 0.5 percent and 0.75 percent this year , he said . 
the recovery would be too weak to have any impact on unemployment , he said , forecasting that joblessness would average 10.3 percent this year and 10.4 percent in 1997 . 
the report forecast Germany &apos;s total public budget deficit would be 3.4 percent of GDP next year -- above the three percent required by the Maastricht treaty . 
but it said this forecast only included austerity measures already achieved and not those yet to come . 
&quot; strict implementation of all the austerity measures would be enough to meet the Maastricht deficit target , &quot; Menke said . 
he added , however , that the government &apos;s 1997 tax bill contained some tax cuts which if implemented would require savings measures over and above those contained in the austerity plan announced in April . 
OECD official Eckard Wurzel told Reuters that the forecast of a 3.4 percent deficit in 1997 had been reduced from a prediction of 3.6 percent made in June because Bonn had achieved a very moderate pay deal for public servants for 1997 . 
the two officials would not be drawn on how likely they though Germany was to meet the criterion . 
it &apos;s deficit rose to 3.6 percent of GDP in 1995 and is likely to be close to four percent this year . 
Bonn &apos;s austerity package is designed to cut public spending by 50 billion marks ( $ 33.7 billion ) and social security spending by 20 billion marks next year . 
finance Minister Theo Waigel says this will be sufficient to get the deficit back to 2.5 percent of GDP . 
but the OECD was not convinced : &quot; Fiscal policy could be in danger of losing its credibility if existing policy commitments are not fully observed . 
but it applauded Bonn &apos;s structural reform drive , and urged it to go further down the same road . 
the tightening of fiscal policy could improve the Bundesbank &apos;s room for manoeuvre on interest rates but it would be premature and risky to recommend a strategy of linking monetary policy to fiscal policy , it said . 
&quot; Monetary policy thus needs to adopt a wait-and-see posture .
