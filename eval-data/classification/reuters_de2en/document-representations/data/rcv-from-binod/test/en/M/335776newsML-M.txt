U.S. municipal bond prices softened around one-quarter of a point in early quotes on Monday , as the market looked ahead to a battery of economic reports , including employement cost data on Tuesday . 
for the fourth quarter , economists surveyed by Reuters predicted a 0.9 percent rise in the employment cost index , a key measure of inflation watched by the U.S. central bank . 
the data will be released one week before the Federal Reserve Board &apos;s February 4 open market committee meeting , and traders said the market remained wary of a possible tightening by the central bank that might push yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond over seven percent . 
traders who hope that the economy has not yet picked up enough steam to prompt the central bank to raise interest rates noted that yields have risen roughly 70 basis points , with the cash Treasury bonds now yielding 6.91 percent . 
&quot; I think at close to seven percent , you probably have more than a tightening built into the market , &quot; a trader said , reflecting views that the recent gain in interest rates , which has helped discourage municipal issuers from selling bonds , will be seen as exerting enough pressure to slow the economy . 
at 1000 est , existing home sales for December are due , with economists predicting a slight dip to 4.0 million from 4.04 million , according to a Reuters consensus survey . 
the supply of municipal bonds in the primary market was expected to remain light this week , as it has for all of 1997 so far , with the calender for negotiated and competitive offerings only expected to total $ 1.2 billion . 
competitive sales are anticipated to total $ 491 million in 51 sales . 
the largest is a $ 50 million West Virginia Housing Development Fund issue on Tuesday . 
negotiated sales add up to $ 696 million in 21 offerings . 
the largest is a $ 134 million Suffolk County Industrial Development Authority , N.Y. , deal through Smith Barney Inc . 
looking ahead to next week , Michigan plans to sell $ 900 million of general obligation notes through competitive bidding on February 5 at 1100 est , with Tucker Anthony serving as financial advisor . 
in secondary activity , Delaware River Port Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey revenues of January 2026 , which pay a 5-1 / 2 percent coupon , were offered at 5.69 percent , net , up one basis point . 
and North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency Power System revenues of January 2024 , which pay a 5-5 / 8 percent coupon , were bid at 97 , unchanged . 
March Treasury bond futures on the Chicago Board of Trade fell six ticks to 110-2 / 32 , while March municipal bond futures eased four ticks to 113-29 / 32 . 
the mob spread between the two futures contracts stood at plus 103 ticks .
