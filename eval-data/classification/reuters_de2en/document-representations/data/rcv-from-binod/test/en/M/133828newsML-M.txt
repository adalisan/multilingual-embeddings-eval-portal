a deluge of new offerings totaling about $ 2.2 billion , which drew mixed results , helped depress prices of municipal bonds in the secondary market by 1 / 4 to 3 / 8 on Tuesday . 
while some of the issuers saw their balances decline sharply , partly due to demand by casualty insurers and bond funds , this did not necessarily mean that the issues had left the dealers &apos; shelves . 
&quot; It definitely seems like some of the bonds still are around at some of the dealers , &quot; a trader said . 
similarly , another trader said likely buyers might be holding off to see how Wednesday &apos;s competitive sale of nearly $ 713 million revenue bonds by New Jersey Transit fares . 
and potential buyers have another reason for taking their time : the U.S. Treasury on Wednesday sells of $ 12.5 billion of five-year notes . 
while results from the Treasury &apos;s auction of $ 18.25 billion of two-year notes this afternoon were considered decent , traders said there was no follow-through buying . 
new offerings in the municipal bond market were expected total as much as $ 4.8 billion this week , with the bulk of the sales coming today . 
this has given institutional investors lots of issues to pick and choose from , and some seemed to be pressing for higher yields . 
&quot; It ( demand ) is not broad-based yet , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; There &apos;s a little bit of congestion right now . 
the market is pretty tight , but people want to buy bonds a little cheaper , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; The bonds are in some of the dealers &apos; hands . 
no one &apos;s getting rich off them , people are selling them where they own them or slightly better , &quot; he added . 
among the large primary offerings , California sold $ 500 million of general obligation bonds at a true interest cost of 5.509 percent . 
its syndicate , led by Lehman Brothers , said the unsold issues or balance totaled just over $ 80 million . 
traders said some of the state &apos;s term bonds still seemed to be in need of homes . 
Minnesota sold $ 170 million of GO at a true interest cost of 5.16 percent , and its syndicate , led by J.P. Morgan Securities , reported a $ 48 million balance . 
and Massachusetts Water Resources sold $ 150 million of bonds at a true interest cost of 5.7204 percent . 
the balance for these issues was $ 14.5 million , said its syndicate , which was managed by Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co . 
although December municipal bond futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade have underperformed December U.S. Treasury bond futures , this pattern reversed late Tuesday . 
while December municipal bond futures shed seven ticks to 113-31 / 32 , the Treasury bond futures fell 14 ticks to 110-20 / 32 . 
the mob spread fattened slightly from levels seen on Monday to 107 ticks . 
actively traded issues in the secondary market included Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority of March 2020 , which pay a 5-1 / 4 percent coupon , and were bid at 5.76 percent net . 
this was up three basis points from Monday &apos;s levels . 
yet Matagorda County Texas Navigation District Number 1 Pollution Control revenues of May 2030 , which have a 6-1 / 8 percent coupon , were bid at 101-1 / 2 , up 1 / 2 .
