Israel &apos;s finance minister said on Monday he was encouraged by the Jewish state &apos;s falling inflation but was not sure the trend would continue . 
&quot; Inflation in the last eight months was low -- less than seven percent in annual terms . 
we haven &apos;t seen such figures since 1970 , &quot; said Dan Meridor , appointed finance minister last June . 
no , &quot; he told a conference of tax advisers in Jerusalem . 
Meridor said the inflation rate was being forced down by the Bank of Israel &apos;s restrictive monetary policy that has kept interest rates high and prevented the shekel from depreciating . 
Israel &apos;s 1996 inflation rate was 10.6 percent but in the second half of the year the annualised rate fell to less than seven percent despite a widening budget deficit of nearly five percent of gross domestic product . 
the Bank of Israel says that was due to its tough monetary line but as Meridor indicated , a strong shekel due to high interest rates was a key factor in taming inflation . 
Meridor said he was concerned about January &apos;s deficit , which reached 1.28 billion shekels ( $ 383 million ) , and would consider making adjustments if the trend continued . 
&quot; It concerned us on the income side , mainly on the side of indirect taxes , on customs ... We will follow things in the coming month and the one after that and we &apos;ll decide if an adjustment needs to be made in the expenditures , &quot; he said . 
this year &apos;s budget binds the government to keep the deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP this year . 
$ 1 = 3.34 shekels
