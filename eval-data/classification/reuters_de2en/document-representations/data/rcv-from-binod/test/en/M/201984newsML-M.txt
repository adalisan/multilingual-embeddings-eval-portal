the Bulgarian Lev slumped to 330-335 per dollar from 229 in the morning after foreign currency supply thinned down to a trickle and the central bank did not intervene to support the Lev , dealers said . 
&quot; The ( interbank ) market was listless in the afternoon because most traders retreated to the sidelines after the Lev nosedived to 330-335 , &quot; a commercial bank dealer said . 
dealers said an insurance company was bidding for large foreign currency volumes for pending payments of dollar-denominated reinsurance fees , strongly pressuring the Lev amid an almost non-existing dollar supply . 
the central bank did not intervene to support the Lev like it was doing for most of November so far , dealers said . 
a central bank official , who asked not to be identified , told Reuters the bank planned to save its dwindling forex reserves for the possible introduction of a currency board and for foreign debt payments rather than for propping up the Lev . 
additional pressure over the Lev came from the cash market , where Bulgarians converted Lev savings into hard currency , dealers said . 
the dollar was offered at 345-350 levs at exchange bureaux in early afternoon , but lack of demand at these levels made sellers lower their asks for the dollar to 325-330 levs later on , traders said . 
individuals have withdrawn some 13 billion levs from the State Savings Bank since the middle of last week until Tuesday , part of which were probably channeled to the cash forex market , Bistra Dimitrova , head of the SSB told Reuters . 
Central bank ( BNB ) foreign exchange reserves reserves stood near $ 541 million at the end of October , down from $ 1.434 billion a year ago , BNB figures show . 
apart from foreign exchange reserves the central bank manages gold reserves worth some $ 400 million . 
dues to government and bank creditors in the first quarter of 1997 total $ 300 million or some 30 percent of all debt payments for next year .
