the DAX index of 30 blue chip German shares closed 1.79 points or 0.07 percent lower at 2,628.08 on volumes described by dealers as particularly thin . 
&quot; Some market players clearly do not trust recent developments too much , there is a degree of scepticism out there , &quot; one dealer said . 
the market remained unmoved by signals from central bankers and finance ministers at the Franco-German summit in Bavaria that Europe was firmly committed to launching the single currency on time and to strict compliance with entry data . 
a weaker opening on Wall Street added to pressure in the late afternoon after a report said a majority of U.S. banks in the Federal Reserve system were urging a discount rate hike . 
however the dollar remained firm , and could provide a trigger for future records , dealers predicted . 
movements among individual stocks were limited . 
the sharpest jump of the day was window manufacturer Weru which leapt 76 marks to 630 in floor trade after Britain &apos;s Caradon plc said it had upped its Weru stake to 64.8 percent . 
Deutsche Bank ended bourse trade 25 pfennigs higher at 72.70 after comments made at an analyst meeting that recent problems with its London-based Morgan Grenfell unit would not affect earnings but dropped to 72.49 in later trade .
