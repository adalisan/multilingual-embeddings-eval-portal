Polish shares eased on Wednesday after inching up this week and analysts said the stronger selling after price fixing signalled another dip on Thursday with the bourse staying in a horizontal trend . 
but they said investors might soon prove optimistic enough to send the market from its current 14,726.1 points to September 18 &apos;s 30-month high about 100 points higher . 
&quot; We should have a slight fall tomorrow but then maybe stronger buying after price fixing and a subsequent testing of our high , &quot; said Bogdan Kornacki , a trader at Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy ( WBK ) brokerage . 
the main market &apos;s all-share WIG index slipped 0.2 percent to 14,726.1 points and turnover fell 12.3 percent to 108.4 million zlotys ( $ 38.6 million ) on both markets . 
losers led gainers by 32 to 27 with 19 stocks flat . 
analysts said investors could be heartened if September &apos;s business climate indicator , due on Friday , rises on the back of gains in August and July . 
they said investors would also be watching Monday &apos;s food-price figure for September &apos;s last 10 days to help determine if the year-on-year inflation number , due at mid-month , would dip below 20 percent and give cause for an interest-rate cut . 
they said the ruling coalition &apos;s agreement to include privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek in the new treasury ministry could also help the bourse &apos;s mood . 
analysts were surprised by the scale of top gainer aluminium plant Kety &apos;s 9.9-percent jump but said Bank Komunalny , down 7.3 percent , was hit by profit-taking after having surged last week . 
mass privatisation NFI units fell 2.1 percent to 141.5 zlotys ( $ 50.3 ) in 36.3-million-zloty ( $ 12.9 million ) trade .
