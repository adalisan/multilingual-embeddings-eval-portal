NYCE frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled higher on a technical bounce Tuesday following yesterday &apos;s selloff , traders and analysts said . 
&quot; I think the market was overdone on the downside and should not have fallen as much as it did , &quot; said Judy Ganes of Merrill Lynch . 
she noted that last year there were 10,000 fewer speculative long positions in the market than there are now . 
&quot; I just don &apos;t see the specs getting much shorter going into the winter months , &quot; Ganes added . 
January orange juice settled 1.10 cents firmer at 98.45 cents per pound , traded 98.80 to 97.20 cents . 
today &apos;s gains almost negated the 1.85 cent loss made on Monday . 
volume was estimated at 5,000 lots compared to Monday &apos;s official 4,174 lots .
