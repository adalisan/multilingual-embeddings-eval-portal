the British Court of Appeal is to decide on Tuesday the fate of a young Nepalese man threatened with deportation six years after a millionaire fulfilled a &quot; debt of honour &quot; to the boy &apos;s father by bringing him to Britain . 
twenty-year-old Jay Khadka and his guardian , Richard Morley , hope the country &apos;s new Labour government will influence the court and grant Khadka permanent residence , overturning a deportation order issued last year by then Home Secretary ( interior minister ) Michael Howard . 
&quot; I &apos;m a bit hopeful with the new government , but we really won &apos;t know until Tuesday , &quot; Khadka told Reuters in an interview . 
a High Court judge last December upheld the deportation ruling although it agreed the decision might appear harsh . 
&quot; The Home Secretary ( Jack Straw ) has the right to personally decide this matter , &quot; said Morley . 
&quot; ( Prime Minister ) Tony Blair has made a great stand about a new compassionate society after his election . 
now we expect him to deliver that pledge and be as good as his word . 
Khadka &apos;s case has attracted widespread attention because of the unusual circumstances surrounding his arrival in Britain as well as the communal living arrangements of his self-styled &apos; family &apos; . 
Morley brought the young Khadka to Britain to honour a pact made with the boy &apos;s father , a policeman in a remote area of Nepal who saved Morley &apos;s life when he collapsed with a punctured lung while on a mountaineering expedition in 1984 . 
the policeman walked for three days to summon help but refused financial reward , instead imploring Morley to take care of his son should anything happen to him . 
Morley returned to Nepal in 1991 to find that the elder Khadka had died and so brought the boy home with him . 
but because Jay Khadka &apos;s papers stated his age as 18 , Morley was unable to adopt the boy legally . 
it was later determined that he was only 14 at the time . 
&quot; The age of children in poor parts of Asia is often exaggerated without their knowledge so they can work at a much younger age , &quot; Morley said . 
&quot; He looked much younger than his age . 
when he came to England , we gave him a bath and the obvious was immediately realised . 
I took him at his word and he thought he was 18 . 
Khadka now lives on a commune with Morley and six other &apos; family &apos; members -- ranging from ages 18 to 43 -- based in a castle in west England . 
the group has vowed to leave Britain permanently if Khadka is deported . 
&quot; The family intends to stay together , &quot; Morley said . 
&quot; We are a new type of family structure which we think copes with the problems of tomorrow far more effectively than the current structure .
