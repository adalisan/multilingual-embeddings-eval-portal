the National Bank of Slovakia ( NBS ) said it would not hold a repo tender on Wednesday . 
&quot; We decided not to hold the repo operation today since , according to our monitoring of the market situtation , the interbank liquidity appears sufficient , &quot; said Peter Andresic , head of the NBS Open Market Operation Department . 
Andresic said Tuesday &apos;s volume of commercial banks &apos; minimum reserves , deposited in the NBS , slightly exceeded the required amount and that the central bank expected banks further to improve fulfilment of their minimum reserves requirement in coming days . 
the NBS added 2.0 billion crowns into the interbank market through a three-day repo tender on Tuesday , with average yield falling to 16.74 percent from 18.82 percent on Monday . 
the central bank monitors market liquidity on a daily basis and decides each morning whether to hold any open market operations . 
according to NBS figures , the Slovak banking sector as of July 22 lacked 2.70 percent of the cumulative funds needed to meet minimum reserves requirements on July 31 .
