Mongolia &apos;s new spymaster has vowed to create a law-abiding intelligence agency out of the wreckage of the nation &apos;s huge scandal-hit espionage network . 
recruitment had begun for the Centre for State Security , set up this month to replace the disbanded Centre for espionage , agency chief J. Enkhnasan told Reuters in a recent interview . 
&quot; If an employee acts illegally , he must be held accountable , &quot; said Enkhnasan , a former deputy procurator who was appointed this month as Mongolia &apos;s first civilian spymaster . 
the government earlier this month dismissed former spy chief General J. Baatar and dissolved the Centre for espionage , known in Mongolian as the TTG , after an investigation found it had illegally spied on opposition politicians . 
Enkhnasan said the Centre for State Security would employ agents according to new standards and would have a smaller staff than its predecessor . 
&quot; The criterion will be the professionalism of the individuals , &quot; said Enkhnasan , a slim , well-dressed official in his mid-40s . 
&quot; We require that the employees work within a legal framework , &quot; he said , adding that a great deal of training was needed and general discipline among workers had to improve . 
the new centre was drafting regulations to cover ethical issues related to both the working and private lives of its employees , he said . 
&quot; Only ethically qualified people may work here , &quot; he said . 
a parliamentary committee has said it found evidence that the TTG bugged telephones of the ex-communist Mongolian People &apos;s Revolutionary Party ( MPRP ) -- which was unseated in elections in June -- and conducted other illegal surveillance activities . 
those abuses were only part of a larger pattern of illegal activities by the TTG that began well before the change in government , parliamentarians said . 
some former officials from the TTG would find work at the new centre , but leaks would not be tolerated , Enkhnasan said . 
Mongolia has been rocked by several scandals involving intelligence officials in recent years , with local newspapers coming under fire for allegedly publishing state secrets . 
Enkhnasan said the new centre would not employ the same number of people as the TTG but declined to specify its size , saying such information was a state secret . 
the centre had earlier said it would have at least 140 fewer staff than the TTG , which Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan has said was larger than all government ministries combined . 
Parliament should create a proper legal framework for the intelligence service to work in , including the clarification of current laws on state security , Enhknasan said . 
a major goal was to improve the publice image of the intelligence sevice through greater openness , he said . 
&quot; We are looking to develop closer contacts with the public , &quot; Enkhnasan said .
