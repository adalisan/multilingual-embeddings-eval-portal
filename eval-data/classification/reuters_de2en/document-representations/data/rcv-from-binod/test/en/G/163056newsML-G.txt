Gigi Lentini , once the world &apos;s most expensive soccer player , may well have turned the corner on Sunday after spending three years in the doldrums following an horrific car accident . 
playing for Atalanta against his old club AC Milan , Lentini made a 40-metre break reminiscent of his best form to set up Filippo Inzaghi &apos;s goal in his side &apos;s 1-1 draw in Milan . 
later on Sunday , Lentini received another morale boost with an unexpected call-up from Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi for Wednesday &apos;s friendly against Bosnia in Sarajevo . 
Lentini , 27 , made international headlines in July 1992 when Milan splashed out a reported $ 14 million to buy him from Torino . 
almost exactly one year later , however , his career suffered a serious setback when he came close to death in a car accident on the Genoa-Turin motorway while driving home after playing for Milan in a friendly in Genoa . 
Lentini took many months to recover from an accident in which he had suffered head injuries that left him in a coma for 24 hours . 
for seasons Lentini was effectively relegated to the role of reserve at Milan , playing only 26 out of 68 league games , often as a substitute . 
keen to play regular first team soccer , Lentini accepted a close-season move on loan to Atalanta , a side coached by Emiliano Mondonico who worked with him at Torino . 
on his return to the San Siro on Sunday , he was greeted with applause from his ex-fans and a banner which read , &quot; Gigi Come Back To Us &quot; . 
speaking after the game , Lentini said he appreciated the reception by the Milan fans , adding : &quot; We &apos;ve got to keep playing with this spirit . 
as for Milan , they didn &apos;t look too good to me . 
you can see that it &apos;s not going to be their year . 
Lentini &apos;s good form has already prompted speculation that Milan may want him back at the end of the season . 
just as his club career suffered a dramatic turn around following his car accident , so too did Lentini &apos;s international career . 
if Lentini plays in this week &apos;s match against Bosnia , it will be his 13th cap and his first since Italy &apos;s 1-0 World Cup qualifying defeat to Switzerland in May 1993 .
