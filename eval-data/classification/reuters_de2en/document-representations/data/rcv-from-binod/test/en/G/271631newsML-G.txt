Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov presented his resignation at a party congress on Saturday following criticism of his handling of the country &apos;s severe economic crisis . 
Videnov said he would not seek re-election as premier or party leader and the two-day congress of his Bulgarian Socialist Party would name a new cabinet . 
&quot; I declare my firm intention not to run for a leading post in the party or the government , &quot; said Videnov , who became prime minister after parliamentary elections in December 1994 . 
Videnov &apos;s announcement , at the end of a long speech defending his performance in the past two years and calling for party unity , stunned delegates accustomed to communist-style party congresses long on rhetoric and short on action . 
delegates said one prominent candidate to replace Videnov was U.S.-born Georgi Pirinski , who resigned as foreign minister last month saying the government lacked public support . 
leading members of the Bulgarian Communist Party renamed themselves Socialists after the end of one-party rule in 1989 . 
the government &apos;s failure to meet reform targets including closing or restructuring loss-making state enterprises has led to the suspension of funding from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . 
&quot; The government is faced with the possibility of being unable to meet its foreign debt payments . 
the consequence would be hyperinflation , which would make the rich richer and the poor poorer , &quot; Videnov said . 
attacks on his government , which is half way through its four-year term , became more vocal after the Socialist candidate &apos;s defeat in last month &apos;s presidential election . 
a marathon 20-hour party plenum last month gave Videnov only narrow backing in a confidence vote and the premier is also under fire over his connections to a shady group of companies known as the Orion Group . 
the deputy head of parliament &apos;s commission against corruption , Edvin Sugarev , wrote to the chief prosecutor on Thursday asking him to investigate Videnov &apos;s links to Orion and its bank , the Bulgarian Agricultural and Industrial Bank , which Sugarev said had caused significant losses to state and private financial institutions . 
a quarter of Bulgaria &apos;s numerous and illiquid banks are in receivership . 
loss of confidence in the banking system caused a run on the Lev , which has fallen from 70 to the dollar at the beginning of the year to 485 now . 
Orion was at the centre of a political row last year after Bulgaria exported large quantities of grain for high world prices , creating shortages at home . 
Videnov has denied in parliament that there are any formal links between the companies , known as the Orion Group because they bear the names of stars in the Orion constellation . 
he says there are only &quot; a friendly circle &quot; . 
influential former prime minister Andrei Lukanov , who was shot dead outside his home on October 2 , was about to reveal high-level government corruption when he was killed , according to his party colleagues . 
in the short term , governemnt upheaval may further delay economic reform . 
IMF technical experts left on Friday after helping the government to prepare the legal measures for setting up a currency board fixed exchange rate regime to halt the fall of the Lev and to draft the 1997 budget framework . 
mission head Anne McGuirk said she hoped to be back in the New Year . 
&quot; A lot depends on how long it takes to resolve the political situation and then we can come back and do the actual negotiation , &quot; she told reporters at the airport on Friday .
