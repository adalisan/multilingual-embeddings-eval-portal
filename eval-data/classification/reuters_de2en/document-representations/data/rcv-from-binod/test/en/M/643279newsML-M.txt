data showing that U.S. soybean processors used more soybeans than expected last week kept CBOT soybean futures higher for most of the session but old crop contracts fell near the close on profit taking , floor sources said . 
&quot; The NOPA number gave us a higher start , but it &apos;s a two edged sword , &quot; said Dave Armstrong , analyst with ABN-AMRO Chicago Corp. &quot; A bigger crush means more meal . 
Thursday , National oilseed Processors Association put the weekly crushing pace at a healthy 25.632 million bushels . 
that figured exceeded trade expectations for 24.00 to 25.45 million bushels and implied that demand for U.S. soybeans remained good despite high prices , traders said . 
activity throughout the session was described as lackluster by most in the trade . 
&quot; Today &apos;s trade was boring , &quot; Armstrong said . 
the late weakness in July and August soybeans was caused by commission houses taking profits in the July / November spread , traders said . 
July soybeans settled 3 / 4 cent lower at $ 8.35-1 / 4 a bushel , with other months 1-1 / 4 cent lower to 4-1 / 4 cents higher .
