Australian opposition treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said on Monday the fall in trend retail sales in October was the first time trend figures had dropped for two months in a row since 1962 . 
&quot; This is the first time trend retail sales have fallen for two months in a row since the ABS ( Australian Bureau of Statistics ) started collecting figures in 1962 , &quot; Evans said in a statement . 
Evans said that given the recent volatility in the seasonally adjusted figures , it was appropriate to focus on the trend figures . 
&quot; Today &apos;s retail sales figures offer little hope of an immediate pick-up in the economy , &quot; Evans said .
