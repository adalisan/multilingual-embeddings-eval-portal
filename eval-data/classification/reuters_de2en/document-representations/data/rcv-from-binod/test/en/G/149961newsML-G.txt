Zaire warned Rwanda it would fight to defend its territory and its vast mineral wealth after the two sides fought a mortar battle across their border . 
foreign Minister Kitidwa Tumansi appeared on state television after Tuesday &apos;s sustained exchange near Bukavu to repeat Zaire &apos;s charges against Rwanda of territorial ambition . 
&quot; Zaire warns those who think the time has come to carve out new political and economic entities with hegemonic designs on its precious and strategic materials , &quot; Kitidwa said . 
&quot; If Rwanda persists in this dream it will be responsible for what happens in the Great Lakes sub-region , &quot; he added . 
Zaire is rich in strategic minerals that virtually guaranteed Western support for its corrupt and inept government led by President Mobutu Sese Seko during the Cold War years . 
at the weekend the sick and absent Mobutu sought to reassert his authority in Zaire &apos;s eastern borderlands by placing the two troubled Kivu provinces under military rule . 
fighting in the east has created the most serious refugee crisis in Africa since apocalyptic massacres in Rwanda in 1994 sent two million people fleeing into nearby states . 
most of the latest refugees were Rwandan Hutus blamed for the 1994 massacre of up to a million minority Tutsis or their sympathisers . 
Hutus fear reprisals in Rwanda but many have headed back home anyway , preferring that risk to violence in Zaire . 
Zaire charges that Rwanda is trying to disperse Hutu refugees deeper inside Zaire to make room for a Tutsi empire . 
both Rwanda and Burundi deny such accusations . 
Reuters reporters and other witnesses in the Rwandan border town of Cyangugu , just across the border from Bukavu , spoke of exchanges lasting about two hours . 
aid workers at one stage had to take refuge from the firing , they said . 
&quot; It was a fairly sustained bombardment , &quot; Reuters Television producer Tony Wende said . 
&quot; The Rwandans fired mortars , anti-aircraft guns and heavy machine-guns with tracers . 
the border bombardment marked the most dangerous turn in nearly two weeks of spreading ethnic warfare , which began with clashes between the Zairean army and ethnic Tutsis . 
the Banyamulenge Tutsis settled from Rwanda 200 years ago and accuse Zaire of trying to expel them . 
Zaire in turn charges Tutsi regimes in Rwanda and Burundi with backing the rebels . 
the arrival of Hutus fleeing massacres in Burundi in 1993 and in Rwanda a year later stoked ethnic rivalries in the area . 
regional diplomats and Western politicians have increased warnings lately that the conflict could engulf the entire Great Lakes region that also includes Uganda and Tanzania . 
the refugee agency UNHCR says nearly half a million refugees have packed a tent camp on volcanic rock outside the eastern Zaire city of Goma . 
the agency says it has no access to up to 400,000 Rwandan Hutus around Goma and 300,000 in Uvira and Goma . 
it appealed to countries to provide satellite photos to help track them . 
&quot; We have requested governments to give us satellite information , &quot; said UNHCR regional coordinator Augustine Mahiga . 
in Brussels , the European Union &apos;s aid commissioner Emma Bonino said one million people , many of them already refugees from Rwanda and Burundi , could die in Zaire . 
she accused the world of standing aloof from the tragedy . 
European diplomats and officials from major humanitarian agencies began urgent talks in Geneva late on Tuesday over the unfolding crisis in eastern Zaire , diplomats said . 
the closed-door meeting , chaired by French Secretary of State for Emergency Humanitarian Action Xavier Emmanuelli , was to examine how to meet the survival needs of the homeless .
