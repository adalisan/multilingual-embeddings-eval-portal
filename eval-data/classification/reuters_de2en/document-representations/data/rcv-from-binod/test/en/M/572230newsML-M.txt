Philippine flour mills , which this week announced the intention of buying 90,000 tonnes of wheat , are expected to clinch deals in the coming week on price dips , traders said on Friday . 
&quot; Philippine mills are ready to pounce at the right price , &quot; an executive in a local flour mill told Reuters . 
on Wednesday , several local mills sent out a series of tender invitations to wheat suppliers after U.S. prices slid for the fourth consecutive session on Tuesday . 
but only one mill bought 7,500 tonnes of western white wheat at $ 4.02 a bushel fob from the U.S. Pacific northwest port for June shipment and 7,500 tonnes of soybean at $ 8.92 a bushel . 
the other millers rejected the other tenders since they anticipate a further slide in U.S. prices . 
Philippine wheat buyers hope prices will drop anew next week on expectations of a higher U.S. winter crop report . 
&quot; If figures on crop damage due to frost and floods in the Kansas and Dakota areas are lower than earlier estimates of 150 to 300 million bushels , then expect lower prices , &quot; said a senior Manila trader . 
corn and rice importers are expected to remain sidelined next week on ample supplies . 
state-owned National Food Authority ( NFA ) said the country &apos;s rice stocks as of April 30 reached 1.60 million tonnes compared with 1.44 million tonnes in the same period last year . 
corn stocks dropped to 232.6 tonnes at the end of April against 287.9 last year . 
NFA pegged Philippine daily rice consumption at 22,000 tonnes per day while corn demand per day was estimated at 14,600 tonnes .
