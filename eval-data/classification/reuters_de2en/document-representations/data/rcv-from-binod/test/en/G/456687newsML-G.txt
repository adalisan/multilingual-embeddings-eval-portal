the president of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday presented a key resolution to enlarge the Security Council that would allow Japan and Germany to become permanent but without veto power . 
the document from Razali Ismail of Malaysia would expand the 15-member council to 24 seats , and is considered the first serious attempt at concrete steps to reform the body after years of discussions . 
it envisages stages that would take about a year before final decisions are made and voted on by the assembly and the council . 
five countries -- the United States , Britain , France , China and Russia -- are permanent members with veto powers . 
Razali &apos;s proposal would add five permanent members and four rotating non-permanent members . 
two of the permanent members would be from industrialized states , and one each from Africa , Asia and Latin America . 
the four non-permanent members would be from Africa , Asia , Eastern Europe and Latin America . 
but none of the new members would have veto power , a provision Japan and Germany are bound to oppose . 
Italy &apos;s Ambasador Paulo Fulci said Razali &apos;s proposals would make the council less democratic , creating three instead of two categories of members in a system &quot; we shall not accept . 
&quot; British Ambassador Sir John Weston said it was a good basis for negotiation and should lead to a decision by the assembly .
