a Japanese firm which borrows and lends shares issued a warning to brokerages on Tuesday that it may run short of shares in Tobishima Corp. 
Japan Securities Finance Co Ltd , which lends shares to brokerages for margin transactions with Finance Ministry authorisation , warned in a statement that it may have problems lending Tobishima shares in the future . 
Brokerages borrow stocks from the company for clients wishing to sell them short in margin transactions . 
by issuing the warning , the company wanted to signal that it may have to limit or suspend fresh lending of Tobishima stocks to brokerages in due course , a Japan Securities official said . 
the warning reflects current outstanding positions of Tobishima shares in the loan market as well as in margin transactions and has nothing to do with Tobishima &apos;s business performance , the official said .
