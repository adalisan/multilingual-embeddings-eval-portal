English club Everton made a fresh bid on Wednesday for midfielder Claus Eftevaag and striker tore Andre Flo , both of Norwegian premier division club Brann Bergen . 
the Norwegian news agency NTB quoted a Brann spokesman as saying Everton were offering 3.0 million pounds ( $ 4.9 million ) for the two players . 
Brann earlier rejected an initial Everton offer and said they did not expect a further bid . 
&quot; We have turned down an initial bid of 2.5 million pounds ( $ 4 million ) for both players , &quot; Brann chairman Lars Henrik Berge said . 
&quot; Everton will not make another offer so the negotiations are over . 
Norwegian newspapers have said Flo , who has played 11 matches for Norway , is worth almost four million pounds alone on the English market . 
Brann were knocked out of the European Cup Winners &apos; Cup last week by Everton &apos;s neighbours Liverpool .
