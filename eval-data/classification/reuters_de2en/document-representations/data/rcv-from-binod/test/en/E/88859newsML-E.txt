top global finance officials are expected to congratulate each other on the improving world economy but warn against complacency at the opening plenary session of the IMF / World Bank annual meeting on Tuesday . 
the gathering , which brings together the economic elite from 181 countries , follows several days of intense discussions that culminated in the launch on Monday of a multi-billion dollar debt relief program for their very poorest members . 
the initiative , which was endorsed by the joint Development Committee of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , aims to lift the burden on countries that must spend the benefits of economic growth servicing their debts . 
&quot; This is a breakthrough , &quot; World Bank President James Wolfensohn told reporters on Monday . 
&quot; It was very good news for the poor of the world . 
the time is ripe for launching such a program because the world economy is looking up . 
the IMF has forecast that global economic growth will speed up to 4.1 percent next year , from 3.8 percent this year . 
even in poverty-stricken Africa , the outlook has improved . 
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said the continent &apos;s economy is expanding at a five percent annual rate , thanks to painful actions to put their finances in shape . 
&quot; There is a new upwards trend that is likely to continue as long as the reform programs hold steady , &quot; he told a news conference on Monday . 
Russia and Mexico , two countries whose problems have dominated past annual meetings , seem on the mend , helped by huge sums of money from the IMF . 
even the pesky currency markets have cooperated . 
led by the United States , rich industrial nations have insisted they want a strong dollar and the markets responded in kind on Monday , pushing the U.S. currency up . 
but that is not to say that no problems exist . 
many parts of the world are still beset by wrenching poverty . 
&quot; While some general conditions are favorable , fundamental development challenges remain , &quot; U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said . 
&quot; We must focus increased attention to working with countries and regions where growth has lagged and where millions remain trapped in poverty . 
the wealthy industrial countries have their problems too . 
Europe is racked by sky-high unemployment and its recovery is fragile at best . 
after years of being mired in a near-recession , Japan &apos;s economy has shown some signs of revival , but the risk of a relapse remains . 
the U.S. economy looks healthy , but there are some worries that long-dormant inflation may be about to pick up after 5-1 / 2 years of growth .
