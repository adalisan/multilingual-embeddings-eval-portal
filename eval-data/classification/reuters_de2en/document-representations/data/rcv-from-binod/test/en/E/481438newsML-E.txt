Brazil and Argentina have reached an agreement to alleviate the effects of measures introduced by Brazil to restrict import financing , Brazil &apos;s O Globo newspaper reported on Wednesday . 
the agreement will also apply to the other member states of the Mercosur free trade pact , Uruguay and Paraguay , as well as Mercosur associates Chile and Bolivia , O Globo newspaper said . 
under the deal , agricultural products , crucial to Argentina &apos;s trade balance , might be excluded from the import restrictions , and a transition period might be introduced for Mercosur countries to adapt to the new measures , O Globo said . 
Brazil &apos;s Central Bank last week announced restrictions on import financing of under a year to curb the country &apos;s ballooning trade deficit , saying its aim was to prevent importers from benefiting from low international interest rates . 
Argentina , Uruguay and Parguay reacted angrily to the measures , which they said would affect their exports to Brazil and complained they had not been consulted in advance . 
Argentine Finance Minister Roque Fernandez is due to arrive in Brazil Wednesday after canceling a trip scheduled for Tuesday , to finalize the accord hammered out between Brazilian and Argentine government officials yesterday .
