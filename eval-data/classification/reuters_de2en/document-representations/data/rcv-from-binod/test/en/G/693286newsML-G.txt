President Bill Clinton , under heavy pressure at a U.N. Earth Summit to cut U.S. pollution , promised on Thursday to reduce the greenhouse gases that cause global warming but refused to set specific targets . 
&quot; We must do better and we will , &quot; he said in a speech to the summit , where his country -- the world &apos;s biggest polluter -- has been the butt of widespread criticism . 
Clinton also pledged $ 1 billion in foreign assistance to help developing countries reduce greenhouse gases . 
U.S. officials said $ 750 million of the money would be shifted over five years from existing foreign aid programmes , while other finance would come from loan guarantees . 
&quot; These funds will go to programmes that support energy efficiency , develop alternative energy sources and improve resource management to promote growth that does not adversely affect the climate , &quot; Clinton said . 
on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels like oil or coal , Clinton said he intended to convince the American people and Congress &quot; that the climate change problem is real and imminent . 
&quot; He said he would hold a conference on the subject . 
he promised to install solar panels on 1 million roofs in the United States by the year 2010 to help move the country away from dependence on fossil fuels . 
environmentalists immediately slammed the speech for rejecting specific targets on cutting greenhouse gases . 
&quot; He devoted his entire speech to global warming and the best he can do is offer up one million solar roofs , &quot; said Richard Mott , of the Worldwide Fund for Nature . 
but Gail McDonald , president of the oil and coal industry-backed Global Climate Coalition , said she was pleased Clinton had &quot; resisted the temptation to use this highly public event to unveil draconian measures that would be harmful to our economy and harmful to the American people . 
&quot; We urge the President to continue to evaluate the economic impacts of his climate policy and how it will affect American workers and their families , &quot; she said . 
Clinton devoted most of his speech to global warming and said the United States would &quot; significantly reduce &quot; its greenhouse gases when industrial nations hold a climate change meeting in Kyoto , Japan . 
&quot; We will work with our people -- and we will bring to the Kyoto conference in December a strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits that will significantly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases , &quot; he said . 
the president has used similar terminology previously , prompting attacks from European Union leaders who want Washington to join them in reducing emissions by 15 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2010 . 
the United States is responsible for 23 percent or 1.39 billion tons of the world &apos;s carbon emissions followed by China with 13.9 percent or 807 million tons . 
&quot; If the trend is not changed scientists expect the seas to rise two feet ( 60 cm ) or more in the next century , &quot; Clinton said . 
&quot; In America that means 9,000 square miles ( 23,000 sq km ) of Florida , Louisiana and other costal areas will be flooded . 
&quot; In Asia , 17 percent of Bangladesh , home to 6 million people , would suffer a similar fate while island chains like the Maldives &quot; will disappear from the map . 
climate changes , he said , would disrupt agriculture , cause severe droughts , floods and the spread of infectious diseases , including 50 million or more cases a year of malaria . 
the week-long conference ends on Friday with a document expected to be be high on promises but low on commitments . 
the 173-nation meeting was called to review progress made since a landmark environmental summit in Rio five years ago . 
two of the most divisive issues at the meeting were targets to reduce global warming and funds to help developing countries meet new environmental standards . 
foreign aid in the United States has dropped drastically in the last few years . 
in 1995 it was $ 7.3 billion compared to $ 9.9 billion the previous year . 
Japan , France and Germany spend more .
