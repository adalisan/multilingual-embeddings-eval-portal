IPE Brent and gas oil futures are expected to open weaker on Friday , extending the week &apos;s slide sparked by Iraq &apos;s return to the export market and sliding U.S. gasoline prices , brokers said . 
Aug gas oil , which closed at $ 172.50 a tonne , was expected to open about $ 2.50 lower while Sept Brent was expected to begin trading about 10-15 cents below its Thursday settlement of $ 18.90 a barrel . 
people shouldn &apos;t have been too surprised by the recent selloff and there &apos;s little standing in the way of further losses , &quot; said a broker . 
U.S. gasoline prices fell sharply on Thursday as talk of improving supply reversed a seasonal rally built on the back of particularly active driving season . 
rampant NYMEX gasoline futures and Iraq &apos;s absence from the crude market since late May were the two main motors for the summer rally which took prompt Brent crude to a 10-week high of $ 19.64 a barrel on Monday . 
but this week has seen both supports removed . 
&quot; If we go below $ 18.80 on Brent then we could be heading for a much bigger drop , &quot; said a broker . 
interim support on August gas oil was pegged at $ 170.50 . 
on Wednesday , Iraq &apos;s oil minister Amir Muhammed Rasheed said he expected exports to resume by mid-August . 
pricing formulas covering the renewed sales have been passed to the U.N. Security Council &apos;s sanctions committee which has until 1500 GMT on Friday to raise any objections . 
traders are bracing themselves for a flood of Iraqi crude starting next week , which would undermine spot market values of alternative crudes .
