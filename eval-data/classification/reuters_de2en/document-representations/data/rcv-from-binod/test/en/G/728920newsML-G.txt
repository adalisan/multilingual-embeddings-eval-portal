the Hong Kong government on Tuesday fended off attacks on its plans for the first legislative election under Chinese rule , saying they were not meant to limit representation of the pro-democracy camp . 
defending the government &apos;s stance , Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Nicholas ng said regardless of which electoral method was used , the populist Democratic Party could command all seats if it won enough votes . 
&quot; If the community &apos;s aspirations are all uniform and everyone supports the Democratic Party , it doesn &apos;t matter which system you choose . 
they will grab all the seats , &quot; ng said during a news briefing to foreign journalists . 
ng &apos;s comments follow attacks on the government after last week &apos;s unveiling of electoral methods for Hong Kong &apos;s first legislative election , which will be held next May . 
the former British colony of 156 years was returned to China on July 1 . 
under the plan , Hong Kong will dump the first-past-the-post method for the 20 seats of the 60-seat chamber to be directly elected from geographical constituencies , opting for a proportional representation system . 
the territory will be divided into five constituencies , each with three to five seats depending on the size of population . 
in the last legislative election in 1995 , the territory was divided into 20 smaller geographical consistencies , each of which allocated one seat . 
but analysts and critics of the new system have predicted that pro-democracy parties are unlikely to repeat their strong 1995 showing in which they won the largest bloc of seats in the ousted colonial assembly . 
the assembly was replaced by a provisional chamber upon Hong Kong &apos;s handover . 
but ng defended the plan . 
&quot; The beauty of the proportional representation system is that it is designed in such a way that different factions of opinion would be represented in accordance to the support they get from the community , &quot; ng said . 
in the new electoral plan , functional constituencies will return 30 seats , while another 10 will be elected from an election committee formed with 800 permanent Hong Kong residents from different sectors .
