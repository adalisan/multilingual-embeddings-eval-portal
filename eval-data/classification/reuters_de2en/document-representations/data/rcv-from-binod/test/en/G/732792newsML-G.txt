a former Navy officer turned private lawyer pleaded not guilty Wednesday to killing his wife and two children . 
Scott Pickles , 40 , was charged with three counts of murder and three counts of capital felony , which could bring the death penalty . 
prosecutors did not say whether they will seek the maximum punishment against Pickles , held in lieu of $ 3 million bail . 
prosecutors said Pickles stabbed his wife , Susan , 38 , suffocated his daughter Elizabeth , 6 , and beat his son Alexander , 3 , in home June 18 or 19 . 
Connecticut authorities said Pickles confessed when he was arrested several days later in Raleigh , North Carolina . 
friends and colleagues described Pickles as a struggling , small-town lawyer known for devout Christian faith . 
he became an attorney two years ago after serving in the U.S. Navy and working in the defence industry . 
Connecticut has not executed any prisoners since 1960 , a state Department of corrections spokeswomen said . 
there are six prisoners on death row .
