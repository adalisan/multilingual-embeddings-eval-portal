Austria &apos;s largest paper maker Frantschach said on Tuesday it is confident its offer to buy Poland &apos;s Zaklady Celulozy i Papieru Celuloza SA will soon get the nod from the Polish government . 
&quot; We feel ( our offer is ) very strong -- we &apos;re very confident and can expect a decision within the next few days , &quot; Frantschach chief executive Gernot Strobl told Reuters . 
Strobl , whose company is owned 50 percent by South Africa &apos;s Mondi Minorco Paper , declined to reveal how much the company had offered for Poland &apos;s biggest paper and cellulose producer , nor the identity of the other bidders . 
Poland &apos;s treasury ministry aims to sell up to 65 percent of shares in Celuloza Swiecie to a strategic investor and float 15 percent of its shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange this month . 
Frantschach , which is unlisted , aims to finance the acquisition from the proceeds of a recent 650 million schilling nominal capital increase .
