Naphtha prices were immobile in afternoon Tokyo trade on Tuesday , despite a small gain on overseas crude markets overnight , due to bearish regional fundamentals , traders said . 
Naphtha prices failed to track crude oil due to ample availability of near-term cargoes , they said . 
Open-spec naphtha for second-half August was assessed at $ 203.50 / 204.50 per tonne after it was sold to a European trader at $ 204.00 . 
in dealing for prompt delivery , a second-half July cargo was sold to a Japanese petrochemical manufacturer at $ 200.75 . 
in the low sulphur waxy residue ( LSWR ) market , buyers were said to be awaiting Pertamina &apos;s July allocation , with June requirements having mostly been covered . 
fuel oil traders expected the July market to remain firm as Pertamina &apos;s initial allocation for next month is likely to be as low as three million barrels , partly because a turnaround at the Balikpapan refinery scheduled for July is likely to cut Indonesia &apos;s LSWR output . 
Pertamina &apos;s initial allocation totalled 3.75 million to 3.9 million barrels for May and 3.1 million for June .
