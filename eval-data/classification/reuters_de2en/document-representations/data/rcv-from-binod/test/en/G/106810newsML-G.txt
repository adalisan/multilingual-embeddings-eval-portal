a majority of Japanese voters remain undecided over their choices in October 20 general elections , according to a media poll published on Wednesday . 
in the Tokyo Shimbun poll of 3,000 eligible voters across the nation , 56 percent of respondents said they had not decided on their choice of candidate in new , single-seat constituencies . 
the poll , conducted last week , also found that 58 percent had not made up their minds about which party to vote for in the 11 regional proportional representation blocs . 
parties kicked off an official 12-day campaign on Tuesday ahead of voting day on October 20 . 
under a new system to be introduced this time , 300 members of the powerful Lower House of parliament will be chosen in single-seat constituencies , while 200 will be elected through proportional representation . 
voters are to be given two ballots , one for a candidate in the constituency and another for a party in 11 regional blocs , where winners will be decided through proportional representation . 
candidates can run in both domains . 
asked which issue was the most important , the sales tax came first with 34.2 percent , followed by 24.8 percent for welfare , 24.7 percent for administrative and fiscal reforms and five percent for the environment . 
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has vowed to go ahead with plans to raise the tax on all goods and services from three percent to five percent next April , but to accompany the increase with moves to streamline bureaucracy and improve welfare . 
the opposition Shinshinto ( New Frontier Party ) vehemently opposes this and instead has vowed to introduce a hefty 18 trillion yen ( $ 162 billion ) income tax cut . 
the concentration of U.S. bases on the southern island of Okinawa has faded away as an election issue because all parties favour streamlining them . 
asked what they thought of that issue , 46 percent said they supported scrapping all U.S. bases and strengthening the Japanese Self-Defence Forces , while 42 percent said they favoured maintaining the current strengths of both the Japanese military and U.S. forces in Japan . 
in the constituencies , Hashimoto &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) topped all parties with a support rating of 26.3 percent , followed by 15.6 percent for the main opposition Shinshinto and 11.2 for the new Democratic Party . 
the support figures here include those who have not made a firm decision . 
in the proportional representation domain , the LDP also led with 29.1 percent support , followed by Shinshinto &apos;s 13.8 percent and 11.4 percent for the Democrats .
