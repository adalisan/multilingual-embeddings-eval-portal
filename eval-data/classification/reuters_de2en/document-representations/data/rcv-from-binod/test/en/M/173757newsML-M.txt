Dutch shares closed mixed on Thursday , dragging themselves up from the day &apos;s lows in a last hour rally as Wall Street extended Wednesday &apos;s 96 point gain with another rise at its opening . 
the AEX share index closed 0.83 points easier at 588.60 , up from an earlier session low of 586.48 . 
but dealers said investors mistrusted the trend on Wall Street and were happier to take their cue from markets closer to home such as London and Frankfurt , which showed solid declines . 
&quot; It &apos;s not normal when Wall Street is up 100 points and we &apos;re down , you don &apos;t see that happening too often , &quot; said a trader . 
dealers said Thursday &apos;s last minute share rally was accompanied by a modest bond market recovery , which if it and the Wall Street gain held out , could pave the way for Dutch shares to gain ground on Friday . 
&quot; Maybe we can expect a rise tomorrow , but there &apos;s still a lot of caution about third quarter figures which have been a little disappointing recently , &quot; a trader said . 
others took a different view , predicting further churning between 585 and 590 on the AEX . 
&quot; There &apos;s plenty of cash around but it &apos;s not a bullish market at the moment and it means we will continue to consolidate at these levels , &quot; said another dealer . 
Akzo shares were down 1.60 guilders to 213.70 , a two-day fall of 3.90 guilders , following results yesterday which came below many expectations . 
dealers said they saw some pressure continuing on Akzo as analysts reviewed their ratings on the stock and considered cutting estimates of future results . 
KLM slipped 20 cents to 41.50 guilders , adding to Wednesday &apos;s 2.10 guilder drop following Tuesday &apos;s announcement of falling first half operating profit and a cost cutting plan . 
&quot; Mr Bouw ( the KLM chief executive ) has set some ambitious and necessary targets and the market is very interested to see how he goes about achieving them , &quot; said a dealer . 
music and movies group Polygram climbed 2.10 guilders to 79.20 on the feeling that the shares had been oversold . 
the shares have drifted from around 100 guilders since August , falling sharply in October after a profits warning . 
Philips , 75 percent shareholder in Polygram , was 80 cents higher at 60.80 . 
Unilever closed 10 cents lower at 258.60 guilders . 
the shares had been down to 256.40 guilders on jitters ahead of its third quarter figures due on Friday .
