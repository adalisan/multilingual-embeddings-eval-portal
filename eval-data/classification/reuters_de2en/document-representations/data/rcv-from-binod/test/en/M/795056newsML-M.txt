the fall in Malaysian share prices was due to a decline of the ringgit against the U.S. dollar , Nik Mohamad Din Nik Yusoff , executive chairman of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange ( KLSE ) said on Tuesday . 
&quot; From what I can see it is the weakening of the ringgit . 
that seems to be the factor causing the market to weaken , &quot; he told reporters after launching the Jardine Fleming apex Malaysia Growth Trust fund . 
&quot; There is nothing wrong with the economy . 
the fundamentals are good , &quot; Nik Din said . 
&quot; That is why I urge people to go into the market to buy now . 
there is nothing adverse about our economy , &quot; he said . 
he did not elaborate . 
the KLSE &apos;s key blue-chip index has been falling sharply in the last few weeks , hitting a new 21-month low on Tuesday morning . 
a few minutes after the lunch break on Tuesday , the composite Index was at 887.05 points , down 15.09 or 1.67 percent .
