British Prime Minister John Major opened a new front on Tuesday in his election battle by audaciously linking his hostility to closer European integration with his opposition to devolution for Scotland . 
at a campaign stop in the central Scottish town of Perth , Major said that because Brussels wants Europe &apos;s states to break up into regions , any further transfer of power to the European Union risked cutting Scotland adrift from the United Kingdom . 
senior Conservatives said Major intended to hammer home the message over the next two days on the stump in Scotland , culminating in a keynote speech in Aberdeen on Wednesday . 
&quot; There are two issues , &quot; Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth told reporters . 
&quot; One is the fight to maintain the United Kingdom , and the other is the determination to ensure that we have a strong and successful Europe -- that we are in Europe but are not run by it . 
&quot; And that is a very powerful cocktail that is undoubtedly going to provide us with considerable support on May 1 . 
earlier , Major traded jibes with opposition Labour leader Tony Blair over who would best defend Britain in Europe , after a surprise intervention by EU Commission head Jacques Santer . 
Santer on Monday attacked Eurosceptic &quot; doom merchants &quot; and insisted European states should move towards closer integration . 
major told a morning news conference that he had warned Britain would face strong pressures to agree to integrationist moves at the European Union summit in Amsterdam in June . 
&quot; Yesterday , President Santer confirmed these are exactly the things that others in Europe want to secure and Mr Blair made a speech in which he made clear that many of these objectives are objectives Labour share . 
Blair hit back , saying it was Major who had Santer appointed after arguing he would be less federalist than Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene , original favourite for the job . 
he also attacked Major &apos;s handling of the mad cow disease ( BSE ) crisis . 
&quot; Who will best stand up and fight for British interests - John Major , the man who appointed Jacques Santer , who gave us the beef war and the fiasco over BSE and who can &apos;t even keep his own party together in the course of an election campaign ? 
&quot; Or me , the person who transformed the Labour Party into the strongest , most professional , most disciplined fighting force in British politics ? 
&quot; Blair told another news conference . 
in Scotland , Major said the task of his Conservative party if returned for an unprecedented fifth consecutive term of office would be to ensure that Britain &quot; doesn &apos;t sink itself into a Europe of the regions ... 
&quot; A centralist , federalist Europe with more authority taken away from the Westminster parliament and handed to the European parliament and the Commission and others in Brussels . 
in a confident soapbox speech that belied his poor showing in opinion polls , Major said these were the great constitutional election issues that transcended everyday politics . 
major is convinced that his impassioned defence of the Union between England and Scotland helped him to come from behind to win the 1992 election . 
by reviving the issue now , and harnessing it to what Conservatives believe to be their trump card in 1997 -- opposition to ceding sovereignty to Europe -- strategists believe they are onto a winner . 
major attacked the main opposition Labour party &apos;s plans to set up a parliament in Edinburgh with tax-raising powers as a &quot; constitutional absurdity &quot; and warned that it was bound to lead to conflict with the parliament in London and thence to independence for Scotland . 
&quot; understand that point ! 
baldly and in the most straightforward fashion I say it : the devolutionary proposals of our political opponents are the first step on the route that inevitably will lead -- I cannot tell you how soon -- to the break-up of the United Kingdom as we at present know it , &quot; the prime minister said .
