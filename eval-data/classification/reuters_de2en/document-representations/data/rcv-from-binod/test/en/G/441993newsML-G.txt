Olympic champions the Netherlands top an all-star cast at the five-nation Jubilee of Pakistan hockey tournament which begins on Sunday to celebrate 50 years of the nation &apos;s independence . 
the Dutch , who followed their Olympic success in Atlanta by winning the Champions trophy in Madras in December , have included eight of their gold-medal winning squad in a bid to collect some more silverware for thir trophy cabinet . 
but they will face some stern opposition with a further four of the top seven hockey nations in the world taking part . 
Pakstan , the hosts and World Cup holders , seem likely to present the toughest challenge although the Dutch will also be wary of Australia , the bronze medallists in Atlanta , whom they meet in the opening match of the tournament . 
European champions Germany and European bronze medallists England , with a new coach and just four of Britain &apos;s Olympic squad , will also be keen to make a mark . 
the two countries in the top seven to miss the tournament are Spain and South Korea who have spent the last fortnight trying to qualify for next year &apos;s World Cup . 
the tournament consists of a round-robin during the first week with the final on March 23 .
