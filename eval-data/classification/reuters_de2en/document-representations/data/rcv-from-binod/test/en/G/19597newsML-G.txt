the French government flew some 15 Africans out of the country on Wednesday , ignoring protests against its tough immigration policies and using an air force plane after trade unionists threatened to block the flight . 
eyewitnesses saw the Africans taken aboard a wide-bodied Airbus A-310 which took off from Evreux airbase as thousands of angry demonstrators marched through Paris to demand that expulsion orders be repealed and immigration laws reviewed . 
there was no official comment on how many Africans were on board and where they were being flown to . 
human rights sources said they included three of 300 African protesters dragged out of a Paris church in a controversial police raid last week . 
CIMADE , a group looking after immigrants , said the plane was bound for Mali and Senegal . 
sources in the Malian capital Bamako said a French flight was expected and would fly on to Kinshasa . 
an air force Airbus flew 57 immigrants back to Mali , Senegal and Zaire last weekend . 
radio reports said two civilian aircraft left later from Evreux but it was not clear whether there were any Africans on board .

CIMADE said a deportation flight had been scheduled from Paris Roissy airport . 
the CFDT union said the government had tried to charter an Air France plane to fly illegal immigrants back to Tunisia , Niger and Zaire . 
it asked staff of the state-owned airline to prevent the flight . 
human rights activists , including dissident former bishop Jacques Gaillot , urged pilots to refuse to fly the deportees . 
&quot; We ... solemnly ask you to uphold the dignity of French aviation by refusing to be part of this ignominy , &quot; they said . 
Gaillot , Communist Party leader Robert Hue , and prominent human rights activists led Paris demonstrators chanting : &quot; We all are children of immigrants . 
police estimated the marchers at 11,000 , twice the size of a similar protest last week . 
some demonstrators clashed with riot police who stopped them marching to the Saint-Bernard church where the Africans had been holed up , 10 of them on a hunger strike they called off after 52 days . 
some 500 people protesting against the deportations marched through Lyon and Bordeaux . 
the government &apos;s handling of the illegal immigration issue has become a hot topic since police raided the Paris church . 
four of the church protesters were deported at the weekend and 66 have received expulsion orders , some 20 of which could legally be enforced at any time . 
another 49 have been promised residence permits following a review of their cases on humanitarian grounds . 
human rights groups , labour unions and the left-wing opposition branded last week &apos;s police raid as a human rights disaster . 
but the far-right National Front accused the conservative government of being too soft on immigration . 
government spokesman Alain Lamassoure defended the decision to evacuate the church as having saved the hunger strikers &apos; lives . 
he repeated that the government was determined to enforce 1993 laws to curb clandestine immigration while reviewing individual cases on humanitarian grounds .
