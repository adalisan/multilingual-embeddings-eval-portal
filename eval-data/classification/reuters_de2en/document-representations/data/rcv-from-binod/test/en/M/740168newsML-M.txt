German Bunds and futures turned tail from slightly better bid midsession levels on Friday , shadowing U.S. treasuries lower in late trade . 
analysts said that while the German market had held up reltively well despite a stronger June IFO business climate index than expected , the negative pull of the U.S. market had proved too much , prompting investors to take profits before the weekend . 
&quot; When you get a slip like this in treasuries at the end of the week , people are too nervous to hold on , &quot; said one Frankfurt-based trader . 
the U.S. market was hit by a record University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey , with a preliminary reading of 116.2 in July versus 104.5 , according to market sources . 
by 1450 the September DTB Bund future was nine basis points weaker at 102.76 , having dropped to a 102.67 low after the U.S. data were released . 
the session high was plotted at 102.98 . 
domestic data showing business sentiment improving for the third month in succession failed to unsettle the German market unduly . 
the June IFO index rose to 96.0 from 95.4 in May , but IFO &apos;s president said the data showed only a very moderate German economic recovery . 
&quot; It ( the IFO index ) is good for the bits of the economy that are doing better , &quot; said Kit Juckes , bond and currency strategist at NatWest Markets in London . 
&quot; ( But ) Germany &apos;s problem is the weakness of the employment situation and this number doesn &apos;t tell us anything about that . 
other analysts said , however , that any continued weakness in the German mark against the dollar would add to the recovery of the export sector in coming months , eventually filtering though into the labour market . 
in cash Bunds , the 10-year benchmark was offering a bid yield of 5.562 percent at a price of 103.21 by 1453 GMT . 
but in terms of performance , Bunds remained ahead of treasuries despite being undermined by the U.S. market &apos;s weakness . 
the 10-year T-note / Bund yield gap was trading at 75 basis points by 1455 GMT , around four basis points wider than its level in late European dealings on Thursday .
