two new polls gave President Bill Clinton a commanding lead over Republican Bob Dole on Thursday as the two camps began negotiations on the upcoming presidential debates . 
a Los Angeles Times poll of likely voters gave Clinton 54 percent , Dole 37 percent with 8 percent for Texas billionaire Ross Perot . 
a Pew Research Centre survey of registered voters produced similar figures : Clinton 52 percent , Dole 34 percent , Perot 8 percent . 
both surveys portrayed an electorate generally optimistic about the state of the economy and showed Dole &apos;s ambitious plan to cut income tax rates by 15 percent was not attracting wide support . 
looking at individual state polls , Clinton led in 35 states , 28 of them beyond the statistical margin of error . 
dole led in 14 , only three beyond the margin of error . 
campaign officials on Thursday began negotiations on the format of the presidential debates , the first of which was tentatively scheduled for Sept 25 . 
the meeting was not expected to produce any firm decisions and further talks were anticipated next week . 
the key issue was whether Perot should be allowed to participate . 
the commission was to make a recommendation by Monday about Perot . 
campaigning in Kentucky , Dole said he welcomed the opportunity to face Clinton but tried to keep expectations about his performance low . 
&quot; President Clinton is a very smooth talker , and I &apos;ll be facing him in debates one of these days , &quot; Dole said . 
dole also complained about Clinton &apos;s negative campaign advertisements , which he termed &quot; character assassination . 
&quot; They &apos;ll say Bob Dole &apos;s a decent man and then comes the axe . 
and it comes every day . 
millions and millions ... of dollars in negative ads , &quot; Dole said . 
&quot; They &apos;re going to try to frighten all of you . 
they &apos;re going to tell you that Bob Dole ... is an extremist . 
the Dole campaign dealt with a minor embarrassment when an unpaid consultant resigned after supermarket tabloids reported he and his wife had advertised for group sex . 
the consultant , Roger Stone , said he was the victim of a dirty trick . 
Clinton was on his 27th trip to California , a state that accounts for one-fifth of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the Nov . 5 election . 
the 50-year-old president , vying to become the first Democratic president since Franklin Roosevelt elected to a second term , discussed education policy and was due to wind up at a glitzy Hollywood fundraising gala . 
he led Dole in California by more than 20 points . 
the Iraq crisis rumbled on , meanwhile , with Clinton administration officials continuing to threaten President Saddam Hussein with military action and Republicans criticising Clinton &apos;s performance . 
former Secretary of State James Baker told the Senate Armed Services Committee that although Clinton appeared to be readying more strikes against Iraq , he should have hit harder in the first strike last week . 
Baker also said Clinton failed to hold together the allied coalition that won the 1991 Gulf War and failed to avoid a power vacuum created by Kurdish civil war in northern Iraq &quot; into which Saddam Hussein has now adroitly moved .
