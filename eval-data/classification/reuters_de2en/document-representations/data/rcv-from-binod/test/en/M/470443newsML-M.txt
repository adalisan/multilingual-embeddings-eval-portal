German Bunds strongly outperformed their U.S. counterparts on Wednesday , but were nonetheless pulled lower in absolute terms on the day by the quarter point increase in the Federal Funds rate on Tuesday . 
analysts said that after the Bund market &apos;s recent declines , they see buying opportunities starting to emerge and that the contract should find support not far below 100.00 
at 1419 GMT , the Bund futures contract was down 19 basis points at 100.28 , but had traded as low as 99.95 shortly after the open . 
traders said volume was light on the day with dealers taking vacation ahead of the Easter holiday . 
Bunds , however , pushed ahead convincingly against treasuries , pushing the spread to 104 basis points from 94 basis points at the previous close . 
analysts said worries that the Fed may again raise rates at the same time that German inflation looks tame and the Bundesbank appears unlikely to raise rates should help Bunds further against treasuries . 
&quot; Bunds should outperform in the weeks to come , &quot; said Stuart Trow , analyst at Norinchukin International in London . 
some said they would not be surprised to see Bunds climb back to around a 120 basis-point spread vs their U.S. counterparts . 
the Federal Statistics Office lent support to those seeing further Bund gains in the morning when it reported preliminary west German consumer prices fell 0.1 percent from the month before and climbed only 1.6 percent from a year earlier . 
since the Fed &apos;s rate hike , the German yield curve has steepened , adding five basis points to 214 basis points to the spread between two- and 10-year maturities . 
analysts said the steepening was mostly due to the typical outperformance of five-year maturities when the the benchmark 10-year Bund is under pressure . 
with no major dometic events scheduled the rest of the week , traders will be closely watching the U.S. for the market &apos;s next move . 
already this afternoon strong durable goods data out of the U.S. , which normally would have scant market impact , sent treasuries lower and added to Bund / T-note spread .
