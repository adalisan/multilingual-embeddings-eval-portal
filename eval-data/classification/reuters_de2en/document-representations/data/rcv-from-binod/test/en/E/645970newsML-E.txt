economic growth is expected to pick up in Korea during the second half of the year but is still expected to be around six percent for the year as a whole , a senior central bank official said . 
&quot; GDP ( gross domestic product ) in the second half is forecast to be higher than in the first half , driven largely by exports , &quot; Shim Hoon , assistant governor of the Bank of Korea told Reuters Financial Television . 
however he added that real GDP growth for the year would be &quot; slightly above six percent for the year as a whole , &quot; noting however that this is considered &quot; quite low for Korean standards . 
reasons for the relatively soft growth are both sluggish consumer spending and investment , Shim Hoon said . 
he was in Basle to attend the annual meeting of the Bank of International Settlements . 
for the year as a whole Shim Hoon said the central bank was expecting to post a current account deficit of around $ 18 billion , smaller than last year &apos;s $ 23.7 billion figure . 
Shim Hoon also predicted that inflation , which had been relatively stable for some time , would tick higher in the coming months , fuelled by &quot; the lagging effect of the depreciation of the currency and the accumulated inflationary pressures on the cost side . 
for the year as a whole the central bank sees an inflation rate of 4.5 percent .
