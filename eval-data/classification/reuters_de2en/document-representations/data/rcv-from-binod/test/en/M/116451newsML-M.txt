London robusta coffee futures recovered slightly from midday levels at Tuesday &apos;s close but origin selling limited the gains , traders said . 
&quot; There is origin selling but more on the January contract , &quot; said one trader . 
far Eastern origins were said to be the most active sellers but Ivory Coast also sold on a daily basis . 
London was called to open between $ 20 and $ 25 higher on Tuesday , but the session was stuck in a narrow price corridor while roasters continued to keep to the sidelines . 
the November / January spread narrowed to $ 65 at the close from $ 70 in early dealings . 
traders said the market was likely to see continued origin selling with the Vietnam crop about to come on board . 
the benchmark November contract ended $ 8 higher on the day at $ 1,528 a tonne after ranging between $ 1,535 and $ 1,517 . 
the second-month January lost $ 1 to end at $ 1,459 .

technically , November has been hovering above a cluster of short-term moving averages around the $ 1,520 level , and values now look set to target the 40-day average at $ 1,555 . 
but technical analysts said any challenge of support could spark a slide to the reaction lows seen in early September . 
the Green Coffee Association &apos;s September stock report is due to be released after the close of business , and brokers said they expected a fall of between 100,000 and 200,000 bags .
