NWE oil products all firmed on Tuesday , largely following futures gains , but only the gas oil market was fundamentally strong , dealers said . 
heating oil barges were up between $ 3 and $ 4 as IPE futures firmed . 
the market remained tight . 
gasoline ticked up $ 1 a tonne after the NYMEX gasoline contract recovered in out-of-hours trading . 
but prompt barges were still very poorly bid . 
traders said the weak prompt price was testiment to the absence of bids . 
&quot; There &apos;s barely anyone really wanting prompt at the moment , &quot; one trader said . 
high sulphur fuel oil barges edged up after initial weakness . 
two lots traded at $ 109.00 and $ 109.50 fob Ara , the buyer the same for both deals . 
bunker demand was lacklustre with early signs of about 6-7,000 tonnes .
