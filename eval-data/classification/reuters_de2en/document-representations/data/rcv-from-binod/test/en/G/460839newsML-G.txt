war-scarred Cambodia hopes to revive its largely lost culture of cinema when it hosts its first international film festival and competition next week , organisers said on Friday . 
the First Southeast Asian Biennial Film Festival and photo Exhibition will run from March 29 to April 5 and showcase films from Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , Burma , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . 
two awards will be conferred by an international jury and celebrities such as France &apos;s film star Alain Delon , Indonesia &apos;s Christine Hakim and Thailand &apos;s Jintars Sukhaphat will be on hand . 
twelve films are entered in the competition and 33 more will be shown in a fringe festival . 
Cambodian cinema has suffered from decades of war and decimation by the ultra-leftist 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime , which systematically destroyed cultural tradition and killed many artists . 
more than one million Cambodians , including the country &apos;s most educated , lost their lives during the &quot; killing fields &quot; period . 
only a handful of film makers from the 1960s are still alive . 
some will join the festival and show their work . 
the process of revival is a painfully slow one , making the festival an important opportunity for Cambodians to collaborate with their counterparts in the region , said festival organisers , who include the French Embassy , the embassies of Southeast Asian countries and the Ministry of Culture .
