Greek government ministers will face charges at a special informal court for crimes against the environment over a controversial river diversion project , environmental groups said on Wednesday . 
&quot; We could never bring the accused to a real court to face these charges because they are protected by parliamentary immunity , &quot; said Vassilis Dorovinis of the Greek Society . 
the Council of State , Greece &apos;s top administrative court , condemned as illegal the $ 120 million plan to divert water from the western Acheloos river to the eastern Thessaly plain for irrigation and hydroelectric power . 
the planned dams would flood a mediaeval monastery and centuries-old bridges and villages . 
&quot; It &apos;s the first time that such a court deals with crimes against the environment , &quot; Dorovinis said . 
the &quot; trial &quot; , to take place over this weekend , was organised by Greenpeace , the World Wide Fund for Nature , the Greek ornithological Society , the Greek Society for the Protection of Nature and the Greek Society . 
&quot; The aim of the informal court is not so much to pass sentences but to attribute responsibility and begin a dialogue on the real issues of the project , &quot; Ilias Efthymiopoulos , head of the Greenpeace Greek office told a news conference . 
work has continued on the diversion project despite fears it will ruin the habitat of protected species on the river &apos;s 217 km ( 135 mile ) course . 
environment Minister Costas Laliotis , seven former ministers , as well as heads of three major construction firms and the Public Power Corporation will be on &quot; trial &quot; for charges ranging from cheating the European Union to risking human lives . 
the president of the Athens Bar Association will be the presiding judge and other prominent law experts will be judges , prosecutors and defence lawyers . 
&quot; We have invited the defendants but we have not heard from them , &quot; Efthymiopoulos said . 
&quot; We have listed 30 witnesses , both for the prosecution and the defence .
