Iran on Thursday rejected as biased a German court ruling that Tehran ordered the 1992 killings of four Kurdish dissidents , and withdrew its ambassador to Germany for consultations and expelled four German diplomats . 
foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the court verdict was unfounded and influenced by a propaganda campaign against Iran , the official Iranian IRNA news agency reported . 
he said the ruling had been made &quot; in an unjust and biased manner based on the false claims of counter-revolutionary elements and hostile political propaganda of the Zionists &quot; . 
he said Iran had recalled ambassador Hossein Moussavian for consultations and was waiting for an official text of the verdict . 
Iran also summoned Germany &apos;s ambassador to its foreign ministry over the verdict and expelled four German diplomats , the agency said . 
in its sentence on Thursday , the court avoided citing names but gave the positions of the Iranian officials it believed were behind the murders as members of a committee which included the state president and Iran &apos;s religious leader . 
Iran &apos;s parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri , speaking in Moscow , dismissed the court verdict as political . 
Iran &apos;s ties with Germany , Tehran &apos;s main trade partner , have been strained over the German charges that spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ordered the murders . 
Iran has denied being involved . 
Iran &apos;s moves came as Germany announced it was recalling its ambassador from Tehran and expelling four Iranian diplomatic staff . 
Bonn also said it was ending its policy of &quot; critical dialogue &quot; with Tehran for the foreseeable future . 
IRNA said security measures around Germany &apos;s embassy in Tehran were intensified . 
residents said dozens of riot police and several police cars on Thursday night stood around the embassy compound located in central Tehran at the corner of Berlin street and a major avenue . 
the embassy had been closed all day even though it is usually open on Thursdays , the residents said . 
Iran has repeatedly denied all responsibility for the killings which it blames on infighting among opposition groups . 
it has condemned the trial as politically motivated , citing that a main witness was Abolhassan Banisadr -- Iran &apos;s first president who fled to France after being deposed in 1981 . 
Banisadr is accused by Tehran of hijacking and other crimes . 
foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said on Wednesday a &quot; negative &quot; verdict could damage ties with Bonn and denied reports the 500 German nationals living in Iran were at risk . 
he was reacting to reports that pro-Iranian groups might attack German interests or that German nationals in Iran were under threat if the court backed the charges against Iran . 
Velayati said Iran had good relations with Germany and drew a distinction between the court and the Bonn government . 
Germany has been Iran &apos;s most important Western friend and has resisted pressure , mainly from the United States and Britain , to shun Iran which they accuse of state terrorism , a charge Tehran denies . 
Iranian analysts said they believed Iran would issue strongly worded protests against the court &apos;s ruling but doubted it would go as far as jeopardising its vital ties with Germany . 
they referred to comments by Khamenei late last year as the row broke that the United States and Israel were Iran &apos;s main enemies and disputes with other countries were secondary . 
they said the comments looked like an attempt to defuse the row . 
the court gave life sentences to Kazem Darabi , an Iranian , and Abbas Rhayel , a Lebanese . 
two other Lebanese received prison sentences of between five and 11 years as accomplices . 
it found a fifth man innocent of complicity charges . 
the Germany foreign ministry has warned Germans not to travel to Iran unless absolutely necessary and to remain in constant contact with the embassy in Tehran . 
in November , protesters marched on the embassy , pelted it with eggs and stones and called for the death of German state prosecutor Bruno Jost . 
Bonn last year issued an arrest warrant for Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan , accusing him of masterminding the murders .
