CSCE cocoa futures erased early losses to end moderately higher on Monday , buoyed by a late-session round of local short-covering , traders said . 
but with volume reaching a mere 3,003 lots on the day , traders viewed today &apos;s session as a wash . a holiday in many continental European countries , including Germany , kept market participation to a minimum , they said . 
&quot; It was really dead , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; Nothing happened , it was really an inside day . 
benchmark July futures ended up $ 10 , to $ 1,477 , after trading between $ 1,480 and $ 1,458 . 
Second-month September closed $ 11 lower , at $ 1,504 , while the remaining months slumped $ 12 to $ 15 . 
local selling pressured the market early on and prices spent the bulk of the session drifting at modestly lower levels . 
a round of light trade buying , however , was enough to prompt some locals to cover their short positions . 
technically , traders said July would face some initial support near today &apos;s low at $ 1,460- $ 1,458 , with the next level pegged at $ 1,445- $ 1,441 . 
resistance was seen at the $ 1,494- $ 1,501 gap on the charts .
