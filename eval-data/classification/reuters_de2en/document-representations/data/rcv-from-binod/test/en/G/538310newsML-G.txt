it &apos;s not that the &quot; Fight Doctor &quot; hates George Foreman personally . 
Ferdie Pacheco hates the example the 48-year-old fighter is setting for other older boxers who have been tempted to risk their lives by going back to taking punches for pay . 
&quot; Foreman &apos;s opening the barn door to all these ex-champs to come back , &quot; said Pacheco , who dubbed himself &quot; The Fight Doctor &quot; in the days when he ministered to Muhammad Ali when the great champion ruled the heavyweight world . 
that was before Pacheco quit Ali &apos;s corner after failing to convince him to retire . 
&quot; When George came back and got millions , they decided they &apos;d come back for some big paydays , &quot; Pacheco said Thursday in an interview from his home in Tampa , Florida . 
Foreman , 75-4 , is a slight underdog in the fight against the 31-year-old Savarese ( 36-0 ) . 
if Foreman , who will be paid about $ 4 million compared to Savarese &apos;s $ 500,000 , wins he can be expected to angle for millions more against the winner of the June 28 Evander Holyfield-Mike Tyson rematch . 
considering the quality of his recent opponents , Foreman hardly qualifies for a title fight . 
that &apos;s particularly obvious in light of his refusals of mandatory fights -- most likely because he thought they would be too tough -- after winning two titles in 1994 , leading to his being stripped of his crowns . 
he has fought twice since . 
and Savarese &apos;s opponents have been less than formidable . 
Pacheco used Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson , generally considered the best pound-for-pound fighter ever , as examples of the dangers of older men fighting . 
before he died , Robinson suffered acutely from the effects of taking all those punches over a very long career . 
and Ali sufferes from Parkinson &apos;s Syndrome , which very noticeably affects his motor skills and speech . 
&quot; No one can take a look at Sugar Ray Robinson and Ali and not see that you &apos;re gonna pay the bill eventually , all the tissue you &apos;re damaging , &quot; Pacheco said . 
&quot; George ( Foreman ) has the same brain as everyone else . 
you jar a brain that is soft Jell-O in a hard cover , you &apos;re gonna break little blood vessels , &quot; Pacheco said . 
&quot; Some serious people have beat him up , &quot; said Pacheco , referring to Foreman &apos;s tough fights in recent years against Evander Holyfield , Alex Stewart and Michael Moorer . 
knocking out the congenitally inattentive Moorer in the 10th round in 1994 with a sledgehammer right hand that arrived with all the speed of a dirigible -- making Foreman the oldest heavyweight champion ever -- may have been the worst thing for Foreman and other older fighters as far as Pacheco is concerned . 
Pacheco , who works as a boxing commentator for Showtime cable television -- a rival to HBO , which employs Foreman in a similar capacity -- says he was opposed to Foreman coming out of retirement in 1987 , &quot; not because I didn &apos;t think he could do well but because I thought he could succeed . 
&quot; He had that big punch , and I thought he would do okay and it would only encourage other old fighters to come back . 
the list of former fighters who have returned to the ring or are considering comebacks include 47-year-old former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes , who is admittedly fighting just for the money 24 years after he turned professional . 
former cruiserweight champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi is coming back at 44 , saying , &quot; if ( Foreman ) can do it , I can . 
George has influenced and inspired me . 
&quot; And Saoul Mamby , soon to be 50 , is also returning . 
then there is Sugar Ray Leonard , 41 next month , who embarrassed himself in a loss last month to hector Camacho and says he will fight again . 
Roberto Duran , one of the greatest lightweights ever , is still fighting in his 40s . 
and , Pacheco says , if a promoter dangles some money in front of a lot of other old fighters they would jump through the ropes faster than Don King could say , &quot; Only in America . 
&quot; All of this is singularly due to George &apos;s big punch , &quot; said Pacheco , who feels boxing commissions should deny licenses to older fighters on grounds of age alone , regardless of their apparent health . 
&quot; Boxing , if it were well done would be exhilarating , &quot; Pacheco said . 
&quot; But it &apos;s run like a banana republic . 
if you got the money and the relatives you got the fight . 
and the potential brain damage .
