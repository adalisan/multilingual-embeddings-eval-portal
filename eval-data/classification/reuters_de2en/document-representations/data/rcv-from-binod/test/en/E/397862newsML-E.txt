Russia and Vietnam must come to an agreement on the thorny issue of Hanoi &apos;s old rouble debts to Moscow to clear the way for better bilateral relations , the head of Russia &apos;s lower house of parliament said on Monday . 
Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov told a news conference after meeting officials in Hanoi , that a joint government commission would probably tackle the question at a meeting in the Vietnamese capital starting on March 15 . 
Communist Vietnam owed Moscow 9.8 billion &quot; transferable roubles &quot; when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , but the two countries have yet to agree on a conversion rate for repayment . 
the Russian side had in the past insisted on the exchange rate which was in place when the money was lent , which would have put the debt at over $ 19 billion . 
at the current exchange rate , however , the debt would total less than $ 2 million . 
Hanoi has partly paid some of the debt in goods , rouble revenue from Vietnamese workers in Russian firms and by converting the money owed into Russian investments in joint ventures in Vietnam . 
analysts say that although Hanoi reached an agreement in principle on settling its roughly $ 1.0 billion debt to commercial creditors last year , its credit profile remained clouded by the rouble debt issue . 
Seleznyov , who held talks with National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh , stressed the importance of trade between the two countries , which official figures put at $ 500 million in 1995 . 
he also stressed the significance of Russian military equipment sales to Vietnam and said that Russia could become a major market for Vietnam &apos;s rice .
