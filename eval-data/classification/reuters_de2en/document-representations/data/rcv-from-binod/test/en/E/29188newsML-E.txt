the apparent surge in foreign trade in July and the scepticism that this evoked among professional economists provides the opportunity to raise again the whole issue of the manner of publication of the foreign trade statistics by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise . 
the point is that the present system may lead to unwarranted conclusions about the actual course of foreign trade , and that there is no means of evaluating whether this is the case or not , until a whole year has elapsed . 
firstly , we should be reminded that the trade statistics as published by the Commissioner refer to the exports and imports of the entire South African Customs Union and not just South Africa . 
on the exports side , for example , the figures are in respect of the exports of all five members of the Union , namely Namibia , Botswana , Swaziland , Lesotho and South Africa to the rest of the world ; they therefore , exclude trade within the Union . 
the volume of exports from the other members of the Union can be very significant and Botswana &apos;s diamonds are a good example . 
the exports also include so-called re-exports , which originated as imports from other countries . 
there is no independent means of judging whether the overall export and import figures are reliable , although from time to time obvious anomalies can be picked up from the detailed trade statistics published by the Commissioner , the more egregious of which give rise to an uneasiness about their reliability . 
for example , 3.9 billion rand brakelinings imported in 1994 , corrected to 3.2 billion rand . 
but the Commissioner will correct the figures in respect of such errors brought to his attention . 
personally , I have brought to the Commissioner &apos;s attention the absence of export figures in the detailed trade statement of exports of refined petroleum products , this was subsequently corrected . 
also troubling are such things as the value of exports of diamonds from Botswana , according to Botswana &apos;s own published figures , being in excess of total exports from the Union in some years . 
which was correct was impossible to establish . 
it is even possible that both were correct but that there was a different basis of evaluation . 
the system that has been in being for many years is that the Commissioner will release cumulative trade figures for the year , broken down according to the principal 21 sections , some three weeks after the end of each month . 
the detailed figures at the eight-digit level , but also on a cumulative basis , follow some two months later . 
the cumulative broad section figures that receive all the publicity are provisional . 
the media deduces the trade figures for the latest month by subtracting the figures given in last month &apos;s release from the figures in the latest release . 
thus July exports were arrived at by subtracting the release for January to June from the release for January to July . 
the Commissioner nowhere says what the July exports are . 
he simply publishes the recorded exports for January to July . 
on the face of it , the practice of deducing the current month seems reasonable . 
but what is overlooked is that any amendments of past months &apos; trade data and late receipts of trade documents will be brought to account in the cumulative figures . 
there may be a number of reasons for late returns , for example , documents that may be the subject of dispute between the Commissioner and the shipping agent , dilatoriness on the part of customs officials of other members of the Union in submitting returns to Pretoria , and delays in processing documents in Pretoria . 
some years ago , a clerk in the Department of Customs and Excise went on leave in December , leaving a pile of unprocessed documents on his desk . 
December trade turned out to be surprisingly low but January trade surprisingly buoyant . 
the trade figures are one of the most important economic statistics available to any country . 
decision makers , both inside government and in the private sector , are influenced by the figures . 
they should , therefore , be as reliable as possible . 
unfortunately , our trade statistics are a by-product of the administration of the various pieces of Customs legislation and do not receive the professional attention that they deserve . 
for example , Botswana customs administration would be more concerned about the accuracy of import data because of the distribution of customs revenue under the SACU agreement than about exports . 
the Commissioner &apos;s task in accumulating the trade data is a very difficult one involving handling a vast amount of documentation and of ensuring correct classifications and , above all , valuation . 
the latter is particularly important especially when the exchange rate is changing rapidly . 
indeed , one may ask what the cumulative value of exports means when the exchange rate has moved from 3.65 rand to the dollar to 4.55 rand to the dollar in seven months . 
the only solution to this problem is for the Commissioner to publish the trade data on an individual monthly basis as opposed to the cumulative basis . 
any amendments to the figures for a particular month would then affect that month and would not then distort the current month as is happening now . 
the design of the tables poses no problems , especially as a single language presentation has become accepted practice . 
it would also be of inestimable value for the Commissioner to establish a professional statistical office that would be more sensitive fo the importance of the data being published . 
also , the employment of a trained economist to provide intelligent public comment on the trade figures . 
one would hope that the South African Chamber of Business would lend its weight to the improvement of the trade statistics .
