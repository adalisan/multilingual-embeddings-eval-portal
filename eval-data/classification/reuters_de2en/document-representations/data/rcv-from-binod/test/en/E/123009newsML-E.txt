Britain has yet to achieve price stability in combination with economic growth but can do so if it sticks to a consistent inflation target , Bank of England chief economist Mervyn King said on Thursday . 
&quot; Both theory and history suggest that it ( price stability ) is within our grasp provided that we continue to pursue consistently a suitable inflation target , &quot; King said in a speech to the Economic and Social Research Council in London . 
&quot; On monetary stability , the test is not whether inflation is below a certain number on a particular date , &quot; King said . 
&quot; It is whether the regime of monetary policy leads to the widespread expectation that inflation will not be a relevant factor in economic decisions in the future . 
he said that a modern central bank must be open in its actions and motives . 
&quot; If it wishes to be judged on a fair and honest basis , it must forsake mystique and mumbo jumbo for transparency and openness .
