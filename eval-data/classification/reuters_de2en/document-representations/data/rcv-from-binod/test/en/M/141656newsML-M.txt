U.S. cities plan to urge the IRS to withdraw its proposed rule that tells localities how to avoid &quot; yield burning &quot; and to &quot; level its guns &quot; at bond dealers instead , a key association said on Wednesday . 
the National League of Cities , in comments it is set to deliver at an Internal Revenue Service hearing on Thursday , said the rule violates Congress &apos; unfunded mandates law , unfairly targets innocent municipalities and has made cities the victims of &quot; vulture &quot; accountants offering aid in calculating what they supposedly owe the IRS . 
the proposed rules , issued on June 26 , set up a &quot; rebuttable presumption &quot; that localities paid fair market price for U.S. treasuries bought with tax-exempt bond proceeds if they get three bids from dealers and dealers have no &quot; material interest &quot; in the offering . 
the League said a rebuttable presumption creates major compliance burdens for cities . 
if Treasury pushes ahead with the rule , it should grant localities that meet certain standards a &quot; safe harbor &quot; from liability , the testimony says . 
the cities said the IRS should not make them pay for the actions of dealers .
