world athletics chiefs are set to soften their penalties on drug cheats next week because most civil court judges are ready to throw the present rules out of court and undermine their control of the sport . 
with more athletes hiring expensive lawyers to contest doping bans , the International amateur Athletic Federation ( IAAF ) will decide whether to halve its four-year ban for serious offences at a two-day congress prior to the world championships in Athens . 
the present four-year ban was introduced in 1991 when the athletics world was still trying to come to terms with Ben Johnson &apos;s positive test for steroids at the 1988 Seoul Olympics , the biggest scandal in the history of the sport . 
but the tough stance has been in danger of falling apart in recent years because a ban of four years is regarded as being too harsh under restraint of trade legislation and athletes can take their cases to the civil courts and win . 
in Germany , where sprinter Katrin Krabbe has taken athletics authorities to court in a much-publicised doping case , the national body has been forced to give up on four-year suspensions altogether and let athletes return to action after two years because of the legal problems . 
the IAAF is now faced with an untenable situation where athletes caught cheating with banned substances are being treated differently depending on their nationality . 
&quot; There are now two categories of athletes . 
&quot; It is better to have a rule that makes sure everybody is treated in the same way . 
otherwise the whole thing is crazy . 
the proposal to return to two-year bans has the backing of both the European governing body as well as the IAAF &apos;s ruling council . 
but that does not mean that the congress will definitely back it when it meets on July 30 and 31 . 
at its last meeting before the 1995 world championships in the Swedish city of Gothenburg , the congress rejected a similar proposal after an emotional debate about sporting morals . 
it was felt that the move would send the wrong signal to cheats . 
Britain , which still has major influence in the sport , played a key role in opposing the changes demanded by other leading European nations , including Germany . 
this time the proposal is much more likely to be passed since the congress is aware that the IAAF &apos;s doping rules are close to collapse and national federations cannot afford another two years of legal confusion . 
more delegates will be aware of the legal difficulties than two years ago , especially since Johnson has also taken his life ban from the sport to the Canadian courts following two positive tests . 
&quot; The proposal should be passed this time , &quot; one IAAF official said . 
&quot; But it is easy to be moralistic when you are a small country which does not have a legal problem and carries out few drug tests .
