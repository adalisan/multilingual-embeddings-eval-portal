the current South America &apos;s World Cup qualifying battle has resulted in second-string squads at COPA America , starting on Wednesday . 
the organising South American Football Confederation ( CSF ) is paying the price for pressing ahead with the tournament at a time when the contest for places in France is reaching a climax . 
the decision to hold COPA America every two years was made at the start of the decade . 
the nine nations now meet each other twice in a marathon competition which requires 18 rounds of fixtures in the same number of months . 
as a result , the COPA has been crammed in between the qualifiers . 
the tournament opens just three days after the latest round of World Cup games while the final , on June 29 , is just one week before the next round of qualifying matches . 
naturally , all countries have given absolute priority to reaching France , reducing the COPA to a mere training session in which they will test some of their less experienced players . 
&quot; This COPA America has caused difficulties for all the teams , &quot; said Argentina coach Daniel Passarella , already upset at the lengthy format for the World Cup qualifiers . 
&quot; I think it was the wrong decision to hold it during the qualifiers . 
it will reduce the level of the tournament . 
of the 12 teams , only world champions Brazil , automatic qualifiers for France , Venezuela , who have no real chance of going , and Bolivia , possibly feeling some obligation as hosts , are fielding full-strength squads . 
Argentina , Colombia , Uruguay and Mexico are sending mixed squads , with a sprinkling of regular internationals among the less experienced . 
Peru and Ecuador , are fielding what are effectively under-23 teams . 
the June 26 final could be in one of two venues -- depending on who reaches it . 
if the host nation qualifies , the game will be held in La Paz , altitude 3,600 metres . 
if they fail , the final will be staged at sea level in Bolivia &apos;s second city Santa Cruz de la Sierra . 
Bolivia , with three high-altitude venues , is the least appropriate host to a tournament in which most teams are forced to arrive at the last minute . 
there can be little acclimatisation . 
competition starts with group A matches between Chile and Paraguay and Argentina and Ecuador . 
the group will be in the country &apos;s third largest city of Cochabamba , at 2,800 metres . 
Group B , which features the hosts , Venezuela , Peru and Uruguay will be split between La Paz and Sucre , which is considerably lower . 
Games involving Bolivia , clearly wanting to make the most of home advantage , will be in La Paz and the others in Sucre . 
Santa Cruz will host group C , which includes Brazil and Colombia and the two Central American nations which have been specially invited , Costa Rica and Mexico . 
under the circumstances , Bolivia , who enjoy a huge advantage when playing in La Paz , and Brazil seem favourites to meet in the final . 
Bolivia would be delighted to repeat their 1963 triumph , when they hosted and won the tournament for the only time . 
none , however , would be willing to swap the trophy for a place in France next year .
