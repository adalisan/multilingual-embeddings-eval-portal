the Hong Kong government bowed to reality on Friday and revised down its economic growth forecast for 1996 . 
some economists said they economy might even have a hard time reaching the reduced figure , although others believed the government was unreasonably pessimistic in its forecast . 
the government revised its real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth forecast for the year to 4.7 percent from 5.0 percent and cut its inflation forecast to 6.8 from 7.5 percent . 
it also estimated second quarter GDP growth at just over four percent , up from 3.1 percent in the first three months of 1996 , and predicted it would pick up in the second half . 
&quot; The figures show the financial secretary had to be persuaded to drop the forecast rate and they &apos;ve settled on this in-between figure , between 5.0 and 4.5 , &quot; chief economist Ian Perkin at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said . 
&quot; But I think 4.7 is going to be difficult to achieve , too , unless you get five to six percent in the final half , &quot; he said . 
financial Secretary Donald Tsang made light of the revision as he toured New Zealand on Friday . 
&quot; 4.7 is on the trend line of 5.0 , &quot; he said . 
Tsang blamed the shift on weaker than expected trade in the first six months , which he described as &quot; not brilliant at all &quot; . 
but he said not only Hong Kong suffered on that front . 
&quot; In the entire East Asia economies , every finance minister has been reducing their forecasts because of that . 
he speculated the lacklustre external trade position may have been a result of currency movements . 
&quot; But to me it is still looking pretty good , &quot; he said . 
Perkin was sceptical . 
&quot; I &apos;m not at all convinced that consumption can get much better ... and I can &apos;t see growth in trade picking up much either , &quot; said Perkin , who three months ago predicted GDP growth of four percent as more reasonable . 
&quot; The latest indications from the United States are there may need to be an interest rate rise before year-end and that would have a negative effect on the Hong Kong economy , &quot; he said . 
but Andrew Freris , chief regional economist at Salomon Brothers , remained upbeat . 
&quot; This was not unexpected but it &apos;s unduly pessimistic and extremely narrowly focused . 
the revision is extremely selective and concentrates on trade , &quot; Freris said . 
&quot; We remain bullish on the Hong Kong economy for 1996 and we are not adjusting our forecast of 5.2 percent , &quot; he said . 
Freris said he saw a continuing recovery of consumption and a mild improvement of the external balance . 
Nicholas Kwan , senior economist at Merrill Lynch , agreed with the government &apos;s forecast . 
&quot; We have been looking at 4.7 for some three months already now , so I guess it &apos;s a move towards reality , &quot; Kwan said . 
he said his department was still calculating inflation for the year at 7.2 percent , slightly higher than the government forecast . 
&quot; But that still shows there is a generally down trend and that there &apos;s not so much pressure on prices . 
on August 1 Hang Seng Bank also cut its forecast for GDP growth to 4.5 from 4.8 percent . 
other forecasters have set figures as low as 3.9 percent . 
in its last quarterly forecast on May 31 the government held firm to its 5.0 percent forecast dating from March , despite scepticism from some economists that the rate was achievable .
