Federal Reserve Gov. 
Lawrence Lindsey on Friday called the economy &quot; solid &quot; but said he saw rising risks of higher inflation . 
&quot; We &apos;re starting to see an acceleration in wages , &quot; he told Reuters in an interview . 
&quot; It &apos;s somewhat of an open question whether that leads to an acceleration in prices . 
wage growth has picked up as the unemployment rate has dropped to a seven-year-plus low of 5.1 percent . 
as the unemployment rate nears 5 percent , the odds of higher inflation become prohibitive , Lindsey said . 
he described the stance of central bank policy now as &quot; roughly neutral . 
we &apos;re very much in the acceptable range , but I think we &apos;re a tad on the low side of that , &quot; he said . 
his comments suggested he might be willing to support a small increase in short-term interest rates when the central bank &apos;s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee next meets Sept . 24 . 
that would not be good news for the stock and bond markets , which shot higher Friday on hopes that the Fed will hold off from raising rates . 
it would also not be welcome at the White House , where President Clinton is betting on a strong economy to help carry him to an election victory Nov . 5 . 
Lindsey acknowledged that the price numbers so far do not show any pickup in inflation . 
but he noted that the Fed cannot afford to wait until they do because then it would be too late to contain it . 
the Labour Department reported Friday that consumer prices rose a mere 0.1 percent in August . 
the anecdotal evidence also does not seem to point to higher inflation . 
companies continue to complain of their inability to make price increases stick . 
but Lindsey pointed out that that means that firms are trying to raise prices , which is not surprising given the upward pressure on their wage costs . 
eventually , he added , the price increases will stick . 
Lindsey , though , did see early signs of speculative froth developing in a variety of asset markets . 
&quot; We &apos;re starting to see a little bit of speculation going on , &quot; he said . 
he pointed to rising prices for vacation homes and Midwest farm land , the buoyant stock market and even the exuberant bond market reaction Friday to the August consumer price data , a single month &apos;s number . 
&quot; The early indications that people perceive this as a one-way bet are beginning to crop up , &quot; Lindsey said , adding , &quot; It &apos;s an attitudinal harbinger of inflation . 
consumer confidence is &quot; very , very high &quot; and credit card debt continues to soar , Lindsey said . 
the economy is fully employed and may even have overshot its potential , although that has not shown up yet in rising prices , he added . 
&quot; When the unemployment rate is 5.1 percent , people know they can get a job tomorrow if they have to , and if they wait two weeks they can get a job for what they &apos;re making currently , and if they wait a month they can get a job for 5 percent more , &quot; Lindsey said . 
&quot; When they start focusing on the latter , you go out of fear into greed . 
we &apos;re not there yet , &quot; he added . 
Lindsey said economic growth was moderating from its hectic second-quarter pace but called the economy solid . 
&quot; By and large , I don &apos;t see a lot of weakness , &quot; he said . 
the economy grew at a 4.8 percent annualized rate in the second quarter -- its fastest level in two years . 
the Fed policy maker said the high level of consumer confidence and the low level of business inventories should support the economy in the months ahead . 
looking further ahead , he said he expects growth to slow to about 1-3 / 4 percent next year . 
but he added , &quot; that &apos;s needed to return us to stability .
