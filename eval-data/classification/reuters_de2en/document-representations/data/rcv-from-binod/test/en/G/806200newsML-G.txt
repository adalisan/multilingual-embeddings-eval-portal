French officials predicted on Monday that high air pollution could worsen this week as a heatwave goes on and car traffic and industrial activity picks up at the end of summer holidays . 
the pollution , caused by a build-up of ozone , eased slightly in Paris after an alert on Sunday but remained at an eye-stinging &quot; level two &quot; in the eastern city of Strasbourg . 
the slightly worse &quot; level three &quot; requires mandatory curbs on use of private cars and means free public transport in big cities . 
environment Minister Dominique Voynet said in a letter to regional prefects ( government representatives ) that the weather forecast made it likely that conditions would worsen this week with hydrocarbon fumes from industry and car traffic increasing . 
she said pollution was however unlikely to reach level three , and asked prefects to step up advice to the public on implementing voluntary restrictions of car traffic and polluting industries . 
tens of thousands of young people streamed into the French capital at the start of a Roman Catholic festival including a four-day visit by Pope John Paul II from Thursday . 
but the hundreds of buses carrying the pilgrims parked in the suburbs to avoid increasing traffic in the city centre . 
police lowered speed limits last week and urged drivers to leave cars at home when the last alert was issued . 
they also urged the elderly and small children to limit their physical activity during the alert .
