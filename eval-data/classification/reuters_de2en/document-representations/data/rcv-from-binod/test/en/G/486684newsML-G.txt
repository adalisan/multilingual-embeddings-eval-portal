if Ghana lose to Sierra Leone in their African group five World Cup qualifier in Freetown on Saturday , the nation &apos;s long , agonised wait for their first place in the finals is likely to continue for at least another four years . 
Ghana , who have been African champions four times and who traditionally shine in worldwide junior competitions , have now been trying without success to reach soccer &apos;s elite competition since 1962 . 
and right now their hopes are in the balance , with the odds probably on them failing again . 
next year , a record number of five African nations will take part in the finals , but unless Ghana beat Sierra Leone , they are unlikely to be among them . 
the Black Stars , as the team are known , are currently third in their group with two points from two drawn matches . 
Morocco top the group with four points while Sierra Leone are second with three . 
only the winners of each of the five groups qualify for France 98 and Ghana cannot afford to drop a single point in their four remaining matches if they are to finally land the spot in the finals they have cherished for so long . 
former Dutch international Rinus Israel has been appointed coach with that as his sole objective . 
his first job is to ensure that infamous feuds which have stifled Ghana &apos;s progress in the past are not allowed to resurface . 
Yaw Preko of Anderlecht , the Brussels-based first division team , one of four players in the current senior squad who have developed through the successful junior teams says : &quot; The feuds have made it difficult for the Black Stars in the past and the new management has to stop them happening again . 
&quot; The senior side always had a problem . 
first of all the players always wanted to tell the coaches what to do . 
when I &apos;ve played in junior teams with Ghana , there has always been just the one team -- coaches and players united . 
with the seniors if you played badly , that &apos;s it , you were out . 
&quot; In the past the selectors have not picked the right players and would not watch you in Europe . 
the management didn &apos;t care . 
sometimes if you told them you had just recovered from injury , they wouldn &apos;t always believe you . 
in the last six years Ghana have reached three consecutive Under-17 World Cup finals winning two of them , and the 1993 World Youth final which they lost to Brazil . 
the Under-23 team took a bronze medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics . 
Ghana &apos;s squad for last year &apos;s African Nations Cup included five players who had been through the Under-17 , Under-20 and Olympic campaigns -- Preko , Daniel Addo , Issac Asare , Samuel Ossei and NII Lamptey . 
Preko , Addo , Asare and Ossei are all involved in the World Cup campaign , and Preko hopes Ghana can repeat their junior success on the World Cup stage . 
victory at the weekend would keep their hopes alive . 
defender Sam Johnson , a team mate of Preko &apos;s at Anderlecht , is optimistic . 
&quot; There is still a good chance we can qualify and really , what the teams in front of us or behind us do is not important . 
&quot; Even if Morocco win three of their remaining games , we can go through if we win our last four matches -- including beating Morocco in Morocco . 
Ghana drew 2-2 with Morocco at home on January 12 scoring twice in the last 11 minutes to force a draw . 
they face Morocco away on June 8 . 
that outcome of that game will either be academic to the Ghanaians -- or of vital importance . 
as defender Frank Amankwah says : &quot; We still have a chance to qualify but we have to win against Sierra Leone first . 
that is all that matters right now .
