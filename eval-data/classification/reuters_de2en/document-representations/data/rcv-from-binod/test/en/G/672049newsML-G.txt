Ghana and Zambia can both put the misery of missing out on World Cup qualification behind them this weekend by becoming the first two teams to reach the finals of next year &apos;s African Nations Cup . 
Ghana need a draw from their match away at Angola to qualify for next February &apos;s finals in Burkina Faso while an away win in Mozambique will put Zambia through to their fifth successive finals . 
a total of 11 qualifying matches will be played around the continent on Saturday and Sunday with only the group four clash between Sierra Leone and Tunisia postponed because of a recent coup in Freetown . 
Ghana lost their chance to go to France next year when they were beaten by Morocco in Casablanca earlier this month . 
but they are expected to become the first team from the seven qualifying groups to make it to the African Nations Cup finals . 
Dutch coach Rinus Israel has dramatically overhauled his team in the last outings , dropping established internationals like Tony Yeboah , Yaw Preko and Sam Johnson for a younger crop of players . 
their group one match in Luanda on Sunday presents Israel with a chance to continue the country &apos;s rehabilitation but Angola are not to be taken lightly . 
the hosts have nine Portuguese-based professionals on hand for a match which they must win to stand any chance of also going to next year &apos;s Nations Cup finals . 
wounded Zambia , whose 3-0 thrashing by South Africa in Johannesburg two weeks ago ruled them out of the World Cup , have also reshuffled their team ahead of Sunday &apos;s match against Mozambique in Maputo . 
coach George Mungwa will be without five key players , including captain Klausha Bwalya , and dropped two more on Wednesday . 
midfielder Andrew Tembo was left out after taking a short holiday in France without permission while striker Nelson Banda is injured . 
Mungwa has called up uncapped Peter Chitila , Masauso Tembo and Frazer Kamwandi for the trip . 
a win on Sunday would see Zambia through and leave Mozambique in an uphill battle for second place in group seven with Malawi , who play host to winless Mauritius in Lilongwe on Saturday . 
Egypt , another team disappointed by their elimination in the World Cup qualifiers , could suffer the same fate in the Nations Cup battle if they lose to Morocco in Casablanca on Sunday . 
the group three match is expected to draw a 100,000-strong crowd to the Mohamed V stadium . 
Egypt trail Morocco and Senegal by two points in the standings . 
Senegal are home to Ethiopia in Dakar on Sunday in the group &apos;s other match . 
Liberia will attempt to play catch-up in group six when they host the Democratic Republic of Congo ( formerly Zaire ) in Monrovia on Sunday . 
Liberia , who disappointed home fans by losing to Namibia in a World Cup qualifier two weeks ago , will welcome the return from injury of star George Weah . 
in the group &apos;s other match , Togo , seeking to qualify for the finals for the first time since 1984 , travel to Arusha to face hosts Tanzania on Saturday . 
in group two , Ivory Coast host Algeria in Bouake while Mali can keep up the pressure with a home win over Benin in Bamako . 
also on Sunday , Kenya play Namibia in Nairobi in group five while leaders Cameroon have a home match against Gabon .
