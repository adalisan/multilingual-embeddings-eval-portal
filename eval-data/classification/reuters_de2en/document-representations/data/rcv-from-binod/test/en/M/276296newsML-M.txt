holiday apathy ruled the U.S. corporate debt markets on Thursday , although generally upbeat market sentiment prompted better bids for high-yielding bonds , according to dealers . 
expectations for still-strong mutual fund cash flows and myriad new issue success in thin markets had some high-yield market participants bidding prices higher in anticipation . 
but strong positive sentiments carried little weight on Thursday with desks less than half-staffed and the New Year &apos;s Day holiday on the horizon . 
&quot; Everything is well bid today but it &apos;s so quiet that it &apos;s just frustrating , &quot; one high-yield trader said . 
&quot; We &apos;re getting a few things done and that &apos;s it . 
bonds of KCS Energy Inc outperformed the pack on paper based on news that a unit of El Paso Energy Corp dismissed its lawsuits against KCS over disputed contracts . 
KCS agreed to an early termination of a contract under which El Paso Energy unit Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co bought natural gas above market prices . 
KCS Energy 11.00 percent notes gained more than one point although traders said they were hard-pressed to locate transactions . 
shares of KCS fell 1-1 / 2 points on Thursday after rising 7-7 / 8 in Tuesday &apos;s session when the settlement was first revealed . 
any talk of trading dried up by early afternoon , according to several market sources . 
investment grade spreads were unchanged in extremely thin trade , dealers said . 
some traders reported light swap activity during the morning . 
U.S. treasuries provided no incentive to trade . 
the 30-year T-bond was unchanged to yield 6.59 percent .
