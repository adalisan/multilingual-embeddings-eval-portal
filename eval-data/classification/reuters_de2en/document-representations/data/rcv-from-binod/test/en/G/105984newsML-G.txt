the U.S. military is investing in high technology to ensure its armed forces remain the most powerful in the world despite large cuts , the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The Department of Defence is planning to enhance its capability in advanced munitions , battlefield surveillance , strategic mobility and the readiness of reserve forces , &quot; it said in its annual report on the state of the world &apos;s military . 
the IISS said the number of air force and navy aircraft capable of delivering precision-guided weapons had already been significantly increased . 
at the same time , weapons were being developed which would enable virtually all the country &apos;s combat aircraft to deliver accurate weapons by day and night in all weather conditions . 
the report also said the military had begun procuring an advanced anti-armour weapon which would allow combat aircraft to attack multiple armoured targets in a single pass . 
improved guidance technology will be introduced between 1997 and 2003 into the anti-armour attack weapons of the Apache helicopter , the army &apos;s tactical missile system and 155mm artillery ammunition . 
the accuracy of conventional air- and ground-launched missiles would be improved over the same period . 
armed forces chiefs have conceded that a number of cruise missiles launched against Iraqi positions last month missed their targets . 
the armed forces will try to improve battlefield surveillance by introducing a fleet of 20 aircraft equipped with a joint-surveillance target-attack radar system capable of detecting moving vehicles deep in enemy territory . 
unmanned reconnaissance drones which fly high above enemy territory will be equipped with better sensors , longer endurance and a stealth capability to help evade detection . 
&quot; Numerous improvements to command , control , communications , computers and intelligence for naval , land and air forces will be implemented , &quot; said the report . 
&quot; These include the capacity to receive and exploit imagery from the increasing range of aerial reconnaissance assets , as well as improving secure communications which are more resistant to electronic countermeasures as well as jamming , &quot; it said . 
the concentration on new technology comes at a time when Washington &apos;s armed forces are shrinking rapidly from their Cold War highs in the late 1980s . 
&quot; Despite major reductions , the United States still possesses the most powerful conventional and nuclear armed forces in the world , &quot; the IISS said . 
by next year there will be 10 U.S. army divisions rather than 18 , 13 tactical air force wings compared to 25 , 500 land-based intercontinental ballistic rather than 1,000 . 
overall manpower will have fallen to 1.5 million from two million .
