Australian marathon swimmer Susie Maroney will try next week to succeed where others have failed -- swimming from Cuba to the United States across the treacherous Florida Straits . 
Maroney , 22 , plans to dive off Havana &apos;s famous Malecon seawall on Thursday on her second attempt to cross the straits . 
if all goes well she will walk ashore 40 hours later near Key West . 
the straits are one of marathon swimming &apos;s last great challenges . 
the distance from Havana to Key West is 90 miles ( 144.8 km ) but Maroney will probably end up swimming over 100 miles ( 160.9 km ) because of the powerful currents . 
&quot; This is probably considered one of the most difficult swims in the world because of the distance , the heat and the sun , &quot; said Bob Duenkel , curator of the International swimming Hall of fame in Fort Lauderdale . 
&quot; The fact that it &apos;s never really been done before makes it all the more noteworthy , &quot; he added . 
unlike the famed English Channel swim , there is no official association or group that monitors the Florida Straits swim , Duenkel said . 
Maroney will have two camera crews on accompanying boats , one from the United States and one from Australia . 
&quot; They would be scrutinising her the whole way . 
there &apos;s really nothing that she can do wrong except get out and get back in , &quot; he said . 
last June Maroney vomited and hallucinated her way across the straits inside an anti-shark cage . 
her team debated the best route and most became seasick themselves . 
she swam for 38 hours and 30 minutes but was plucked from the water 12 miles short of the keys . 
but a couple of marathon swimmers came out and said &apos; but she didn &apos;t make it to the shore &apos; , &quot; Maroney said in recent telephone interview from her home in Sydney . 
this time she has put together a new team and is determined to reach the beach . 
the strong Gulf Stream currents will initially work to her advantage , pushing her in the general direction of the keys as they whip eastward round the southern tip of Florida . 
then she will have to cut across the current or be swept parallel with the island chain . 
&quot; The last 20 miles ( 32.19 km ) is an unbelievable swim . 
you are almost like a salmon trying to get into the Key West area , &quot; said swim coordinator Joe Pignatiello of coral springs , Fla . , who will ride in the lead boat . 
Maroney &apos;s new team includes Australian navigation expert Ean McDonald . 
the longtime seaman and Second World War veteran will consult the latest satellite photos of the currents before finalising the route . 
during the trip he will drop lighted buoys to test the currents . 
success will require a blend of determination and old fashioned luck . 
last year Maroney endured night thunderstorms that spawned 12-15 foot ( 4-5 metre ) seas , Pignatiello said . 
&quot; If Susie doesn &apos;t have to go through a thunderstorm and gets to territorial waters , I think she &apos;s a shoo-in to finish .
