dubbed the Houdini of Belgian crime because of the number of times he has escaped from prison or custody , the last member at large of what was once the country &apos;s most wanted gang goes to trial on Monday . 
it could not have come at a worse time for a country already reeling from the twin scandals of paedophile kidnapping , rape and murder and political assassination that have brought Belgium &apos;s already shaky political system under attack . 
Basri Bajrami , who broke out of a Belgian prison in 1993 in a televised escape that would have movie directors drooling , goes on trial at Brussels &apos; central criminal court on charges related to his membership of the Haemers Gang , which wrought havoc across the country in the 1980s . 
it culminated in the kidnapping in January 1989 for one month of former Belgian prime minister Paul Vanden Boeynants . 
he was released for a ransom reputed to have been more than $ 1.5 million . 
the leader of the gang , Patrick Haemers , was caught in Brazil in May 1989 and extradited to Belgium . 
he hanged himself in prison in 1993 . 
two years after his Brussels jailbreak with a hostage spreadeagled across the windshield of the escape car , his head through the sunroof and a pistol jammed in his mouth , Bajrami was extradited to Belgium from his native Macedonia . 
although the Haemers gang has ceased to exist , its spectre continues to haunt Belgium . 
a central suspect in the so-called Dutroux Affair of child kidnapping , sexual abuse , pornography and murder -- named after the key suspect Marc Dutroux -- is Jean-Michel Nihoul . 
Nihoul , who had prevously been charged only with criminal association , was charged on Thursday with abduction after police rejected the alibi for the night in question that had been provided by a former associate of Patrick Haemers . 
Nihoul , who has admitted only passing acquaintance with Dutroux -- who has confessed to abducting or involvement in the abduction of six young girls -- was identified as being in the vicinity when Laetitia Delhez , 14 , was kidnapped on August 9 . 
Laetitia was rescued six days later , along with Sabine Dardenne , 12 , who had been missing for nearly three months , from a makeshift dungeon in the basement of a house owned by Dutroux in the southern city of Charleroi . 
both girls had been sexually abused . 
the discovery two days later of the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in another Dutroux house and two weeks later of the corpses of teenagers Eefje Lambrecks and An Marchal -- who Dutroux admits kidnapping -- sent the country into shock . 
the arrest one week later of six people , including a former government minister , on charges of having murdered another former Socialist minister , turned shock into disgust at the Belgian judicial and political system . 
Bajrami &apos;s trial will be an uncomfortable and for some , unwanted reminder of Belgium &apos;s darker , criminal side . 
the canker of cheating the system goes all the way to the top -- including the judiciary , according to at least one witness whose first professional acquaintance with the country was a lecture by two judges on how to avoid paying tax .
