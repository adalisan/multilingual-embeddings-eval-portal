the Australian Wheat Board &apos;s ( AWB ) increased estimate of 1997 / 98 pool prices supported more distant contracts on the Sydney futures Exchange ( SFE ) on Thursday . 
settlement prices of nearby contracts edged back slightly while those for more distant contracts advanced . 
Matthew Pegg of Rothschild Australia Ltd said interest in the January 1998 contract reflected the belief that the 1997 / 98 pool price estimate would continue to rise . 
&quot; pool estimates always start off conservative , &quot; he said . 
the new 1997 / 98 estimate translates to a delivered Newcastle port equivalent of A $ 149.00-A $ 159.00 with the deduction of A $ 26.00 for the difference between the pool price fob basis and SFE futures prices delivered port basis . 
this left January 1998 at a premium of about A $ 20.00 to the estimated pool , indicating pool price bets , Pegg said .
