police on Thursday seized five bombs and arrested three men of Middle Eastern origin in a raid that apparently foiled an international plot to target Americans and Jews and bomb the New York subway , officials said . 
in a joint statement the FBI and New York City Police Department said late on Thursday night that evidence gathered so far indicated that two of the individuals intended to target &quot; U.S. and Jewish interests worldwide . 
they did not indicate how wide or realistic the plot was . 
the law enforcement agencies said they had already begun &quot; appropriate notification &quot; to authorities abroad about the plot . 
a complaint signed by an FBI agent and filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday night named two of the suspects as Lafi Khalil and Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer . 
&quot; Abu Mezer indicated that he was involved in making the bombs and provided information on how they could be detonated or disarmed , &quot; the complaint said . 
&quot; He indicated that the bombs were targeted for detonation on the subway . 
two of the three men arrested were shot and wounded by police officers during the 4 : 40 a.m. EDT ( 0840 GMT ) raid on an apartment in the residential Park Slope neighbourhood of Brooklyn , authorities said . 
Court papers said &quot; one defendant attempted to grab an officer &apos;s weapon . 
the second moved toward a black bag , which later was found to contain an explosive device . 
the charges included conspiracy to damage and destroy buildings and vehicles with explosives . 
in a brief hearing , the men were assigned public defenders who requested that the suspects not be interrogated . 
Prosecutor Gordon Mehler told Judge Steven Gold , &quot; Both underwent surgery for multiple bullet wounds and as of late this afternoon were still comatose . 
an Egyptian man living in the same apartment tipped police officers about the explosives Wednesday night , police sources said . 
a Jordanian passport was found in the name of Abu Mezer , authorities said . 
they said Canadian and immigration documents indicated he had sought asylum in the United States and had been arrested previously in Israel . 
new York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that a plot to bomb subways was one of the possibilities being investigated by the Joint Terrorist Task Force of local , state and federal agencies . 
&quot; The devices were tested and a determination has been made that they are bombs , &quot; Giuliani said . 
&quot; There are altogether five devices . 
police Commissioner Howard Safir said the bombs could have killed or wounded people and damaged buildings if they had been detonated . 
&quot; Based on a computer analysis that we did of the amount of explosives and the kind of device , they would kill someone up to 25 feet ( 7.6 metres ) in a confined area and injure someone up to 100 feet ( 30.5 metres ) in an outside area , &quot; Safir said . 
four of the devices were pipe bombs strapped together and contained black powder or nails with wires and switches , according to police sources . 
they said that authorities were alerted Wednesday night when an occupant of the apartment told a police officers people were &quot; making bombs &quot; there . 
the FBI said &quot; a massive investigation &quot; was under way to find out exactly what the bombs were intended for , whether the suspects were acting as individuals or as a group and the possible motive . 
Giuliani said there was no connection between the discovery of the bombs in a residential neighbourhood of Brooklyn and the double suicide bombing of a Jerusalem market Wednesday . 
but he said that one of the men arrested &quot; was yesterday heard expressing support for what happened in Israel . 
&quot; Moslem militants claimed responsibility for killing 13 people and wounding 170 others in Wednesday &apos;s attack . 
&quot; As every hour goes by we know more about this ... but we &apos;re not going to talk about it , &quot; he said . 
Kallstorm urged the media and the public &quot; not to jump to conclusions &quot; about the suspects . 
officers evacuated 90 residents , closed off a four-block area and diverted subway services during the raid and its aftermath .
