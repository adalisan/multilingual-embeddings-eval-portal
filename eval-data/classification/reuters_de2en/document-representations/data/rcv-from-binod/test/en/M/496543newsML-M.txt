Argentine stocks surrendered most early losses and closed mixed Wednesday in a hesitant trading environment , dealers said . 
&quot; The market got off to a fairly good start but lost momentum when Wall Street switched back to losses , &quot; said Rodrigo Diz of brokers Velox . 
&quot; Investors will stay mostly indifferent for now , especially ahead of U.S. inflation data Friday and Tuesday . 
the blue-chip MerVal index shed 0.5 percent to 712.98 , wiping out most of Tuesday &apos;s gains to stand virtually flat on the week . 
however , the broad market index stayed in positive territory throughout the session and closed up 0.3 percent , with losers and winners tied at 19 and 16 stocks closing flat . 
&quot; The stock market is performing a temporary correction but the underlying medium-term tend is positive , because when prices drop international investors still come hunting for bargains , &quot; Diz said . 
floor volume shrank to a paltry 14.7 million pesos from 17.8 million Tuesday , while over-the-counter deals swelled to 130.3 million pesos from 88.4 million Tuesday . 
&quot; The market has entered one of its typical lulls and this time it could last one or two weeks more , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; Beyond that everything depends on the interest rate scenario in New York . 
best blue-chip performers were Telecom and Telefonica , which tacked on 2.2 percent and 1.0 percent , respectively , and construction stock Polledo , up 1.9 percent . 
losers were led by textile and footwear firm Alpargatas , Banco de Galicia and holding company Comercial del Plata , off 3.9 percent , 2.7 percent and 2.6 percent , respectively .
