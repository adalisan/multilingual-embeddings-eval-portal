Bulgaria &apos;s February year-on-year consumer price inflation soared to 1,839 percent from 476.6 percent in January and 28.5 percent in February 1996 , a National Statistics Institute ( NSI ) official said . 
&quot; The Lev slump and subsequent price rises of energy and fuels led to a sharp rise of prices of all consumer goods , &quot; the official told Reuters . 
the Lev fell to 3,200 per dollar on February 7 from around 2,000 at the beginning of the month and rebounded to around 2,000 per dollar on February 28 . 
it traded near 600 at the beginning of 1997 . 
fuel and electricity prices were raised nearly five-fold in the first two months . 
&quot; The vast year-on-year inflation for February indicates Bulgaria is headed towards hyper-inflation , &quot; the NSI official said . 
but inflation could be expected to slow down in March due to the Lev appreciation and falling consumer demand , which made retailers lower prices of some basic goods , the official said . 
the Lev traded at 1,540-1,570 per dollar on the interbank market on Tuesday . 
prices of 32 most traded foods rose about two percent in the first 10 days of March , preliminary NSI figures showed . 
the NSI was working out a second consumer price index based on a smaller basket of 600-700 most traded goods in a bid to reflect more adequately the purchasing power of the population , the official said .
