President Petar Stoyanov vetoed changes in Bulgaria &apos;s electoral law on Tuesday , saying they would weaken the new parliament being elected in April . 
the outgoing parliament -- being dissolved at midnight after a political and economic crisis that forced its Socialist majority to bow to demands for an early election -- accepted the veto without challenge . 
April &apos;s election will therefore be held under unchanged electoral rules . 
Stoyanov , an opposition figure whose election in November was a decisive mark of the Socialist government &apos;s collapsing popularity , objected to parliament &apos;s plan to make it easier for small parties to win places in the legislature . 
the bill passed by parliament would have lowered the barrier to three per cent of the vote , instead of four . 
&quot; Its consequence could be an unstable parliament which may have difficulty in formulating a common will . 
this could be damaging to the country , &quot; Stoyanov said in a statement . 
&quot; The future national assembly needs stability . 
it needs a common will to take important decisions , lead Bulgaria out of its grave economic crisis , crush unprecedented corruption and strengthen confidence in our institutions . 
speaker Blagovest Sendov told state radio parliament could not challenge the veto because the legislature &apos;s State Institutions Committee had failed to assemble a quorum for a vote on the subject . 
&quot; I will not convene parliament because it would be another humiliation to gather without having the committee &apos;s opinion , &quot; Sendov told reporters . 
under Bulgarian law parliament could either accept or overturn the president &apos;s veto in plenary session up to midnight on Tuesday , when its term expires . 
otherwise the previous law remains in force .
