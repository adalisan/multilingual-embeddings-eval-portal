German heating oil buyers have a second headache to contend with inside the first 30 days of the year . 
no sooner has the icy grip , with temperatures dropping below -20 Celsius , dissipated , than the dollar powers to 19-month highs against the mark . 
the dollar has reached heights unequalled since its tumble in June 1994 . 
on Wednesday , it was trading at around DM1.64 , 10 pfennigs , or 6.5 percent , higher than at the start of the year . 
at the same time last year , the dollar bought about 1.48 marks . 
consumers in general have laboured under gas oil prices of over $ 200 a tonne since the end of August . 
for German consumer , who pays in marks for fuel , the dollar &apos;s recent rally therefore doubles the blow . 
as Europe &apos;s key market for heating oil , Germany is feeling the pinch . 
Wednesday &apos;s $ 3 a tonne rise in benchmark gas oil futures in London has simply increased the cost further . 
&quot; We &apos;re really waiting for demand from Germany , but the dollar is so firm , there aren &apos;t all that many ready to buy , &quot; said one gas oil trader . 
the problem is , they will have to be interested soon . 
so say traders . 
except a mild burst of activity in August and early September , German consumers have been happy deferring purchases and drawing down their stocks . 
at the end of December , traders said German household stock levels were just above 55 percent of full capacity . 
a two week cold snap at the start of January undoubtedly took its toll , say traders . 
many now believe end-user stocks may head below 50 percent of capacity . 
&quot; The market will pick up again . 
at such low ( stock ) levels , you have to buy . 
if you need , you need , whatever the cost , &quot; one German trader said . 
added to the price disincentive are lingering ice problems along the Elbe and the tributaries of the Rhine , particularly the Mosel and , to a lesser extent , the Main . 
on the Elbe , barges will not be able to travel as far as Magdeburg . 
routes further inland , to Berlin , will not be clear for shipping for up to two weeks , traders said . 
at Dortmund , for example , barge operators still offer no quotes for deliveries . 
in the Netherlands , barging conditions are steadily improving as temperatures hold above zero Celsius ( 32 Fahrenheit ) . 
the Rotterdam-Antwerp route has cleared up , but the Rotterdam-Flushing connection , to the south , still has patches of heavy floating ice . 
on Wednesday , traders said many barges were forced to sail from Rotterdam to Flushing via Antwerp . 
Dutch water inspectors RIZA said on Wednesday the Rhine was completed clear , but confirmed that there were still problems with ice in the Hollandsch Diep , a major channel in the south of the country . 
independent weather U.S. forecasters weather Services Corp said on Wednesday temperatures will drop to slightly below normal in northwest Europe from Friday .
