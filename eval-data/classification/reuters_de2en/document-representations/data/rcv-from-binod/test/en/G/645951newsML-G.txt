after a week of celebration and ceremony , France &apos;s new leftist government faces a heavy agenda of talks and travel on a wide range of European and domestic matters . 
for Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin , who took power last Tuesday and unveiled a new government just a day later , sharing power with conservative President Jacques Chirac has until now been largely an intellectual exercise . 
but it starts in earnest on Monday with a rapidfire series of meetings with France &apos;s European partners on key policy issues . 
the week starts with Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn representing France at a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Luxembourg expected to focus on the future of European monetary union , in which Paris and Bonn have been prime movers . 
the meeting will be the first since the French left &apos;s upset victory in last Sunday &apos;s parliamentary election . 
the Socialists made clear during the campaign that they wanted an end to the austerity their predecessors felt France needed to meet the criteria for a single currency . 
Strauss-Kahn &apos;s EU counterparts will also look for hints on whether Paris will insist on renegotiating a stability pact intended to assure fiscal restraint once the euro is in place . 
a Jospin aide sent out word on Saturday that the prime minister was still eyeing changes in the pact , which was agreed in Dublin last year and was due to be ratified at an EU summit in Amsterdam beginning on June 16 . 
EU diplomats dismiss some of the Socialists &apos; comments as campaign rhetoric and say France remains a keen supporter of monetary union . 
but the turmoil has raised questions in financial markets whether the euro &apos;s debut will be delayed . 
on Tuesday , Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok , whose country holds the rotating EU presidency until July 1 , will be in Paris for talks with Chirac and new Socialist Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine as well as Jospin . 
the talks are likely to focus on the Amsterdam summit , where member states are expected to reach agreement on a new pact on EU institutional reforms . 
the new French government signalled in Brussels last week that Paris did not intend to delay the pact by making extensive new demands at the last minute . 
also on Tuesday , the government is expected to dislose its stance on a controversial plan by carmaker Renault to close an assembly plant in Vilvoorde , Belgium . 
France is a minority shareholder in Renault , and Jospin was pressed to oppose the closure in a special visit to Paris on Saturday by Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene . 
on Wednesday the new Jospin cabinet will hold its first working cabinet , and Jospin may later in the day meet British Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair , who is scheduled to be in Paris for a dinner with Chirac . 
last Wednesday &apos;s initial cabinet meeting was mostly ceremonial as new leftist ministers , including Communists and Greens , sat smiling as a grim-looking Chirac welcomed them to France &apos;s first era of &quot; cohabitation &quot; -- or power sharing -- between a rightist president and a leftist government . 
on Thursday , EU &apos;s Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy will be in Paris for additional talks on the fate of the euro . 
finally , on Friday Jospin joins Chirac in the French city of Poitiers for their first Franco-German summit with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . 
the Germans have had their share of euro problems , infuriating the Bundesbank by proposing to revalue gold reserves to help it meet the strict standards of monetary union . 
it will also be an important week for the new leftist-dominated French parliament , which holds its first session on Thursday after party groups meet on Wednesday to elect their leaders .
