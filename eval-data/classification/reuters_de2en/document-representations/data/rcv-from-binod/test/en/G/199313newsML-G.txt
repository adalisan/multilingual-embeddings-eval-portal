former England soccer boss Terry Venables will take over as manager of the Australian national team , soccer Australia sources said on Tuesday . 
they said Venables would announce the decision later in the day at a joint news conference with soccer Australia chairman David Hill at Venables &apos; West London drinking club . 
&quot; logic says we wouldn &apos;t be holding a news conference just to say no , &quot; one source told Reuters . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a very positive period during the last few days . 
soccer Australia said Venables and Hill , who have been meeting in recent days , would hold a news conference at noon London time ( noon GMT ) . 
the sources declined to give details of the deal . 
Venables would replace Eddie Thomson , who is going to work in Japan &apos;s L-League . 
many of Australia &apos;s finest players are playing in European professional leagues , but Venables was expected to spend at least six months a year in Australia .
