a historical calculation of ASX / Russell style indices back to the start of 1991 shows the cumulative return of value style stocks has consistently outperformed the market while growth style stocks have lagged . 
introduced in June this year , the Russell / ASX indexes split three existing ASX indexes , the All Ordinaries , the ASX 100 and the Small Ordinaries into growth and value components to create six new indexes which seperately track their performance . 
stocks are ranked from low to high and then separated into quartiles . 
first quartile stocks with a low price to NTA , below 1.6 , are classed as all value style . 
those ranked in the fourth quartile , above 3.3 are classed as all growth style . 
&quot; In the U.S. the experience has been growth stocks can lag value stocks for extended periods of time , then their catch up is remarkably swift , &quot; said Scott Donald , a client manager at Frank Russell Australia . 
speaking at a seminar on the style index conducted by the Securities Institute of Australia , Greg Vaughan , quantitative analyst for HSBC Asset Management , said one theory was that the catch-up period for growth stocks occurred when there was a scarcity of stocks offering growth potential . 
&quot; In Australia , a prime example of this theory has been Coca-Cola Amatil shares this year , &quot; he said . 
Vaughan said the strong performance of Coca-Cola Amatil stock , which has risen about 62 percent since the start of this year , could in theory be partly explained by the fact that it was of the few blue chip Australian stocks offering significant 
growth potential .
