former Israeli cabinet minister Yossi Beilin , a proponent of a Palestinian state , announced his candidacy on Tuesday to succeed Shimon Peres as leader of the main opposition Labour party in internal elections in June . 
political analysts said Beilin stood little chance of defeating former army chief Ehud Barak , the leading candidate in the race , but by contesting the primary election he would be in line for a senior cabinet position if Labour regained power . 
Israeli elections for prime minister , last held in May and won by right-wing Likud party chief Benjamin Netanyahu , are next scheduled for the year 2000 . 
&quot; Shimon Peres announced that he will not run ( in June ) ... therefore I decided to stand for party chief and prime minister in the next government , &quot; Beilin , a Labour member of parliament , told a news conference . 
&quot; After Shimon pulled out , I felt there was no one heading the school of thought he represented , giving the right balance between peace and security , &quot; he said . 
Beilin is author of a peace plan formulated with senior PLO official Mahmoud Abbas , also known as Abu Mazen , that calls for the formation of a demilitarised Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza linked in a confederation with Jordan . 
on the left wing of Labour , Beilin was once described by assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as &quot; Peres &apos;s poodle &quot; . 
former Health Minister Ephraim Sneh has also announced he will run in the Labour election .
