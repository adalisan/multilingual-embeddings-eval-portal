with temperatures on the northern plains plunging far below zero , natural gas and electricity prices are rising as fast as demand . 
temperatures in North Dakota were reported to be around minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit Friday , with winds of 20 miles per hour creating painfully Arctic wind chills . 
&quot; It is cold throughout our entire system and we expect it to be like that all weekend , &quot; said Cathi Christopherson , spokeswoman for Montana-Dakota Utilities Co , a subsidiary of MDU Resources Group Inc . 
demand for natural gas from Montana-Dakota Utilities is expected to near peak levels of about 280 billion British thermal units of demand Friday compared with an average this time of year of about 180 billion . 
natural gas for delivery at Chicago &apos;s city gate , in one of the steepest moves for the region , hit $ 6.50 per million British thermal unit Friday for gas to be delivered over the weekend , compared with $ 3.95 for gas delivered Friday . 
although power demand in the U.S. Mid-West is expected to be above average due to bitter cold , electricity officials said frigid temperatures were not having a significant impact on operations and pricing . 
&quot; These wind chills are certainly something to be concerned about , but really this sort of weather is not out of the ordinary for a Minnesota , Wisconsin winter , &quot; said Mary Heimstead , spokeswoman for Northern States Power Co . 
Northern States serves about 1.4 million electricity customers in Minnesota , Wisconsin , North Dakota , South Dakota and upper Michigan . 
average spot wholesale power prices for Monday business were talked at $ 28.00-32.00 per megawatt hour ( MWh ) for the Dakotas , Minnesota and Wisconsin , electricity traders said . 
spot power for Friday delivery was trading at $ 23.00-28.00 for the same area in Thursday discussion . 
although the power draw for heating was expected to be above normal , demand was expected to be under peak due to the closure of many schools and public facilities . 
the cold is also expected to last through the weekend , when power demand for industrial purposes typically drops off . 
power demand in Montana-Dakota Utilities &apos; territory , which includes northeastern Montana and eastern areas of North and South Dakota , was expected to reach 545 MW Friday , under an all time peak of 555 MW . 
the utility serves about 191,000 electricity and natural gas customers .
