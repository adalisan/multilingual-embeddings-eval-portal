Kurdish fighters from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) retook their stronghold Sulaimaniya in north Iraq but the group &apos;s rival said a further PUK advance beyond the city had been stopped . 
the rival Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , which last month with the help of Iraqi forces beat back the PUK to gain control over the whole Kurdish region , said in a statement that PUK forces had also tried to break through KDP lines east of Qala Diza near the Iranian border . 
&quot; Today PUK forces supported by Iranian Revolutionary Guards launched three successive attacks ... , &quot; said the statement received in Nicosia on Sunday , adding the group failed to break through KDP lines . 
the PUK , which has denied that Iranian troops are helping the force , fled to the Iranian border last month after KDP fighters took the main regional city of Arbil and went on to capture Sulaimaniya . 
after reports at the weekend that PUK forces had taken some towns near Sulaimaniya , KDP and U.N. sources said the group had retaken its former stronghold . 
&quot; Early this morning the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan took over Sulaimaniya from the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Massoud Barzani , &quot; a source at the U.N. coordinator &apos;s headquarters in Baghdad told Reuters . 
Barzani accused Iranian forces of helping the PUK retake the key city and called for international aid against &quot; Iran &apos;s brutal invasion &quot; , Turkey &apos;s Anatolian news agency said . 
&quot; Since October 10 , Iran has started a major invasion of Sulaimaniya province in collaboration with Jalal Talabani , &quot; Barzani said in a statement . 
&quot; We would like to emphatically point out that there is no Iranian involvement or support for our forces in this heroic war of liberation , &quot; it said in a statement . 
Baghdad urged the rival Kurdish groups to stay away from outside powers , in an apparent reference to Iran . 
Saddam chaired a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and leaders of the ruling Baath Party to discuss developments in Iraqi Kurdistan . 
the official Iraqi News Agency ( INA ) , quoting a spokesman for the meeting , said Iraqi leaders urged the warring Kurdish factions to halt fighting and resume peace talks with Baghdad . 
&quot; We call on the parties which have resumed fighting to keep away the foreign powers and not deal with them . 
we also call on them to start talks between themselves . 
&quot; The leadership is ready to extend an invitation to all parties regardless of their background and our opinion or evaluation of this faction or the other , for dialogue in Baghdad , under the sponsorship of the state , &quot; INA said . 
in Damascus , Bayan Jabr , representative of the Shi &apos;ite Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq which is aligned with the PUK , said in a statement the Kurdish group planned to retake the city of Arbil also . 
the U.N. source said forces of PUK leader Talabani had also regained control of Chamchamal to the south and Darbandikhan to the east . 
&quot; The area from the Iranian border deep into Iraqi Kurdistan is now in Talabani &apos;s hands , &quot; the source said . 
he said all U.N. staff in Sulaimaniya were safe and the city was calm . 
he said it apparently fell without any armed struggle . 
&quot; It is just a new day . 
yesterday we had yellow flags today we have green ones , &quot; the source said . 
Iraqi forces intervened on the side of KDP guerrillas led by Barzani late in August and helped them oust the PUK from Arbil , Iraqi Kurdistan &apos;s administrative centre . 
Washington , which opposes any military involvement in the area by Saddam , then launched punitive missile strikes against Iraqi air defence targets in southern Iraq . 
reports reaching the U.N. office in Baghdad said KDP rebels had abandoned the city hours before the arrival of Talabani rebels . 
one source said he did not rule out a deal between the sides : &quot; We have not seen the last act of this drama .
