legal experts and pro-democracy politicians on Friday derided vows by Hong Kong &apos;s future leader Tung Chee-hwa that the territory will keep its freedoms despite plans to curb protests and ban foreign political funding . 
the legal expert said Tung , who takes over on behalf of China on July 1 after Britain returns its colony , must retreat . 
&quot; Tung may find he needs to bend with the wind , &quot; Raymond Wacks , a law professor at Hong Kong University , told Reuters . 
&quot; Hong Kong people are not prepared to be pushed around any more . 
Hong Kong has changed a lot . 
you simply can &apos;t blot out those changes , &quot; said Wacks , who has worked in Hong Kong for 14 years observing the social changes and political liberalisation that have swept through the territory of 6.4 million people . 
in programmes on the U.S. network ABC on Tuesday and Cable News Network on Thursday , Tung , picked to lead post-handover Hong Kong by a Beijing-backed committee last December , denied the freewheeling capitalist territory would lose its liberty . 
on ABC News &apos; &quot; Nightline &quot; programme he vowed that under his leadership there would be no &quot; Tiananmen &quot; crackdowns , a reference to the crushing of a student-led democracy movement by Chinese army tanks in Beijing in 1989 . 
on CNN he promised that freedom and prosperity would survive , although the territory &apos;s links to the communist-ruled mainland would grow ever closer . 
&quot; The long-term interests of Hong Kong and China are the same , &quot; Tung said . 
&quot; What is good for Hong Kong is good for China , and what is good for China is very good for Hong Kong . 
Tung stressed Hong Kong &apos;s economic might and the confidence of its people in a smooth transition to Chinese sovereignty after 156 years of British colonial rule . 
&quot; We as Chinese people see the handover as a coming together , a natural reconciliation ending a long period of separation . 
but Wacks said Tung avoided answering key questions on his proposal to amend laws to compel protesters to obtain police permission for demonstrations and to prohibit foreign donations to Hong Kong political groups . 
&quot; The proposed changes are based on the most specious of grounds and there was no argument to justify it , &quot; Wacks said . 
&quot; There was a signal lack of real political or intellectual depth to any of his remarks . 
Tung &apos;s proposals stirred up a political storm last month . 
they are hotly opposed by pro-democracy parties , lawyers and academics , and by Britain and the United States , but supported by the pro-China political camp . 
a written submission by law professors to Tung &apos;s office on Thursday urged him to delete the notion of &quot; national security &quot; , which he uses to justify restrictions on freedom of assembly and association . 
even if the notion had to be kept , the commission urged , it should be clearly limited to situations where &quot; the existence of China or its territorial integrity or political indepndence is endangered by force or the threat of force , &quot; it said . 
Tung also said on CNN that all parties in Hong Kong would be free to compete in the first post-handover elections , likely to take place in early 1998 . 
but the office of Martin Lee , leader of the Democratic Party , noted that if Tung banned overseas donations to political groups , the party would not stand a chance at the ballot box . 
the party , the biggest single force in Hong Kong &apos;s legislature after free elections in 1995 , gets much of its funding from overseas Hong Kong Chinese supporters . 
&quot; We &apos;ll be bankrupt from not having any funding , and the electoral laws will be skewed and the playing field tilted , and the pro-China group will win . 
sure , they &apos;ll be happy to rout the Democrats after gagging and binding them , &quot; Lee &apos;s spokesman said .
