the Mexican peso closed mixed on Friday after a session marked by calm as traders shunned potential jitters ahead of this weekend &apos;s local elections and the forthcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting . 
&quot; The fact is that dealers couldn &apos;t care less about town hall elections . 
besides , things look like going ahead without a hitch , &quot; said a trader . 
the benchmark 48-hour peso closed 1.1 centavos firmer at 7.9060 / 7.9120 per dollar , while its 24-hour stablemate closed 0.5 centavos softer at 7.8950 / 7.9050 .
