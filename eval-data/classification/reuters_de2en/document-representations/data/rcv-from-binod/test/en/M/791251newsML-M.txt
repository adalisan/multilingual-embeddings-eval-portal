Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said on Tuesday there is genuine fear that the currency volatility that started in Thailand might spread to Hong Kong , but the territory will have no difficulty facing currency speculative activities . 
&quot; There is a genuine fear that volatility which started in Thailand is likely to spread and might come our way and we might have to spend lots of time and energy shooting all the speculative sharks , &quot; Tsang said in a radio interview . 
&quot; For that reason , I think it would be in our interest ultimately that we help , &quot; he said , referring to Hong Kong &apos;s contribution of US $ 1 billion to a US $ 16 billion rescue package for Thailand organised by the International Monetary Fund . 
&quot; But I have no fear at all that Hong Kong will have any difficulty in facing any speculative activities of this kind , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We know that we are an extremely strong economy with robust fundamentals . 
we have total reserves exceeding US $ 80 billion and we do not have any fiscal borrowing . 
and that is one of the strongest ... monetary positions any territory can look for . 
&quot; But I want to look forward to a few weeks of quietness and not to have to deal with and think about speculative activities ... we are living in a global village , &quot; he said . 
the Thai baht has been hit by speculative selling in recent months . 
the attacks forced Thailand to undertake a de facto devaluation of its currency in July . 
Hong Kong &apos;s share of the Thai rescue package will come from the exchange fund -- reserves held to back the Hong Kong dollar -- and will not affect taxpayers , Tsang said . 
the territory was making a bigger contribution to the package than some countries because each nation &apos;s share should depend on the strength of its fiscal reserves , he said . 
Tsang said Hong Kong decided to help as it realised Thailand suffered from a shortage of foreign exchange reserves and its currency lacked the strength to stand speculative attacks . 
&quot; There is a genuine concern that there will be what the international bankers call ( a ) contagion effect spreading in the region . 
so I thought that was an opportunity that we have to react to . 
we could not sit on our hands , &quot; he said . 
he added the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) specifically asked Hong Kong to help . 
he said he believed the US $ 16 billion loan package would work and put off speculators . 
Tsang said he thought China , which was represented in a bankers &apos; meeting on the rescue package called by the IMF in Tokyo on Monday , would be prepared to contribute to the package later . 
&quot; The mainland was equally concerned . 
Beijing was represented at the meeting in Tokyo yesterday and they were reacting very positively to it , &quot; Tsang said . 
&quot; But they have other technical questions to go through . 
and I think they will be prepared to help later on , &quot; he said . 
China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 , ending 156 years of British colonial rule . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we need to put pressure on anybody ( to make a contribution ) . 
every international banker , and particularly central bankers , realises that we are living in a global village where problems ( which ) happen in one area ( are ) likely to affect another area , &quot; Tsang said . 
&quot; So I think Beijing is conscious of the problem facing us collectively , &quot; he said .
