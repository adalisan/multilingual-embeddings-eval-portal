Iran said on Sunday it had arrested a Turkish spy and implied that three Turkish diplomats at the embassy in Tehran knew of his operations , the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported . 
&quot; An agent of the Turkish intelligence agency has been arrested in Orumiyeh , western Iran , &quot; IRNA quoted a security official as saying . 
&quot; The official added that the spy was to receive guidelines from three staff of the Turkish embassy in Tehran in case of running into any trouble or needing coordination , &quot; IRNA said . 
Iran said in April that it had uncovered five spy networks led by Turkish diplomats that threatened security in Iran . 
the allegations were made shortly after a row in which Tehran asked Ankara to withdraw four Turkish diplomats accused of leading spy rings in Iran , and Turkey expelled four Iranian diplomats for their alleged links to killings of Iranian exiles .
