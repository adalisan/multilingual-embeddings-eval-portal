Czech President Vaclav Havel entered a Prague hospital on Monday suffering from pneumonia which has hampered him for more than a week , his office said . 
his spokesman said he will not attend a European security and human rights summit in early December in Lisbon , after cancelling his remaining November schedule because of the illness last week . 
Havel was taken to hospital because his condition had not improved , his spokesman Ladislav Spacek said in a statement . 
on the advice of doctors , he will undergo further examination , Spacek said , but he declined to estimate how long the president would remain in hospital . 
Havel was to take part in the summit of the 54 member countries in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OBSE ) on Decemeber 2 and 3 in Lisbon . 
last week , Havel cancelled a planned two-day state visit to Ukraine because of the pneumonia .
