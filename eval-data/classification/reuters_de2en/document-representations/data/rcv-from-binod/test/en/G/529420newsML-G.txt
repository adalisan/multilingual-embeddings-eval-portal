the selection of the 12 jurors who will decide the fate of accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh is expected on Tuesday , when the trial judge hears legal motions from prosecutors and defence attorneys in the case . 
McVeigh , an Army Gulf War veteran , is charged with bombing the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City on April 19 , 1995 . 
the bombing -- the worst attack on civilians ever on U.S. soil -- killed 168 people , including 19 children . 
McVeigh has pleaded not guilty . 
he faces the death penalty if convicted . 
U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch told the potential jurors questioned on Monday to expect to be called , if they are selected for the panel , within a day . 
&quot; It isn &apos;t going to be much longer , &quot; the judge told one of the potential jurors , who included a college admissions officer , a part-time special education teacher , a communications engineer and a grocery truck driver . 
the impending jury selection sets the stage for opening arguments to begin on Thursday , sources close to the case . 
Wednesday is McVeigh &apos;s 29th birthday . 
it is expected to be a day off for jurors to set their affairs in order , such as notifying their employers . 
the tall , pale McVeigh , who wears his hair in a military- style crew cut , has paid close attention during the juror questioning , standing up and nodding politely to each candidate and taking notes with his defence team . 
prosecutors and defence attorneys were expected on Tuesday morning to present various legal motions and then list their peremptory challenges -- the potential jurors they can have dismissed without giving a reason . 
since the trial began on March 31 , the judge , prosecutors and defence attorneys have quizzed 99 potential jurors to select a jury of 12 plus six alternates . 
prospective jurors have been asked questions to probe their opinions on the death penalty and how much they have been exposed to news accounts of the case . 
six have been excused publicly , including two who disobeyed the judge &apos;s orders about avoiding news on the case . 
Matsch has not announced how many others have been dismissed for causes such as blanket opposition to the death penalty . 
lead prosecutor Joseph Hartzler is expected to make the opening statement for the prosecution , laying out for jurors the government &apos;s case . 
chief defence attorney Stephen Jones will speak for McVeigh . 
in the meantime , a group representing more than 50 news organisations has hired Los Angeles attorney Kelli Sager to mount a challenge to the judge &apos;s gag order on the attorneys in the case . 
the group also wants the judge to remove a wooden screen that has been keeping the jury candidates out of the sight of most spectators in the courtroom . 
Sager , who represented media groups during the O.J. 
Simpson double murder trial in Los Angeles , will also address the issue of jury encoding . 
jurors &apos; names have been kept secret and each has been identified only by a number . 
the judge may also shuffle the numbers or somehow keep them secret , making it impossible to know the genders or the backgrounds of those chosen .
