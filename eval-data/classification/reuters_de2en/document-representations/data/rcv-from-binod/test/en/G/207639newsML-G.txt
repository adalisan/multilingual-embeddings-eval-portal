at least three Palestinians were killed by an explosion on Thursday in a West Bank village , PLO security officials said . 
they said it was unclear what caused the blast in the village of Anza near the self-ruled town of Jenin and the identities of the dead were not immediately known . 
an Islamic militant , possibly preparing to launch a suicide attack against Israel , was killed in the same area of the West Bank on Saturday when a bomb exploded in his hands . 
Israeli security forces have been on high alert for weeks , fearing attempts by the Islamic Jihad guerrilla group to avenge the killing of its leader Fathi Shqaqi in Malta on October 26 , 1995 . 
the blast on Thursday tore off the heads of two of the three dead , security officials said , adding that the Israeli army had taken away two of the bodies . 
an Israeli military spokesman declined immediate comment on the incident . 
the third body was taken to a hospital in Jenin , a doctor said . 
Anza village is in an area where Israel maintains overall security control in accordance with its peace deals with the PLO . 
Palestinian police are also stationed there .
