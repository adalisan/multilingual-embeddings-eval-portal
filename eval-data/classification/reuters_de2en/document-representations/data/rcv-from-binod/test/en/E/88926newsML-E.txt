Jamaican Deputy Prime Minister Seymour Mullings warned on Tuesday against removing trade preferences enjoyed by a number of developing nations , saying this could affect his own and other Caribbean countries . 
&quot; We are of the firm view that no action should be taken to erode our vital interests or remove equitable arrangements of long-standing which affect the very economic survival of some developing countries , &quot; he said in a speech to the General Assembly . 
Mullings , who is also minister of foreign affairs and foreign trade , referred to current action by what he called &quot; a coalition of powerful special interests with respect to the special terms enjoyed by a number of developing countries &quot; through their arrangements with the European Union ( EU ) . 
he was alluding particularly to a duty-free quota for bananas exported to the EU from African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) countries which Latin American banana-producing nations , backed by the United States , are trying to end . 
Mullings said it had been made &quot; abundantly clear that removal of preferences would have a serious negative impact on the economies of Jamaica and other Caribbean countries . 
&quot; My delegation , therefore , calls upon those who would seek to use the World Trade Organization as an instrument to attack the very foundation of the economies of small developing states to desist from this course of action , &quot; he said . 
the &quot; thoughtless assault &quot; on the banana protocol of the Lome Convention -- a trade agreement between the EU and the ACP -- was of great concern to Jamaica and to &quot; sister Caribbean banana producers who stand to suffer economic devastation if the selfish acts of these powerful interests are allowed to succeed , &quot; Mullings said .
