foreign Ministers from the six Gulf Arab states meet in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to unify their response after last week &apos;s missile strikes against Iraq by the United States , their key Western ally . 
Oman &apos;s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah told reporters the Gulf Cooperation Council &apos;s ( GCC ) Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar , Oman , Bahrain and United Arab Emirates formed a committee to draw up its position on Iraq . 
he said after a round of talks late on Saturday that an official statement would be issued on Sunday , but that the group supported the coalition led by the U.S. which last week extended a no-fly zone in southern Iraq to its 33rd parallel . 
&quot; The GCC is with the U.S.-led international coalition ... we support the coalition in this regard , &quot; he said . 
the GCC ministers are discussing the latest developments in northern and southern Iraq , where the U.S. last Tuesday and Wednesday fired 44 cruise missiles . 
Washington said its strike was a response to the Iraqi army &apos;s intervention in northern Iraq to help a Kurdish faction seize a city from a rival group a week ago . 
Iraq has said the attacks killed some of its citizens . 
much of the Arab world has said the attacks infringed Iraq &apos;s sovereignty . 
the six GCC states are close allies of the U.S , which uses planes from warships in the Gulf and facilities in Saudi Arabia to enforce a no-fly zone up to Iraq &apos;s 33rd parallel . 
Washington says the wider zone , extended from the 32nd parallel where it was fixed after Iraq &apos;s defeat in the 1991 Gulf war , was aimed at further restricting Iraq &apos;s ability to pose a threat to its neighbours . 
France and Britain are also part of the coalition . 
Kuwait was the first in the GCC to react officially to the U.S. strikes , saying it fully understood the action . 
Qatar &apos;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani , in remarks to CNN television and reported by the official Qatar news agency on Saturday , said Iraq had the right to protect its territory . 
&quot; On the recent developments in northern Iraq ... ( he ) said these events should come to an end , &quot; according to the Arabic text of Sheikh Hamad &apos;s comments . 
he also said the United States should work for &quot; another approach &quot; to the problem . 
the GCC was part of the U.S.-led multinational force that ended Iraq &apos;s 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait and supported further U.S. action against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . 
the GCC is also holding the talks to discuss terrorism , ties with Iran and Iraq &apos;s oil-for-food deal with the United Nations .
