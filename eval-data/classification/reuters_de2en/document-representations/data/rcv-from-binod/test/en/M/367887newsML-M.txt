German call money rates firmed to 3.10 / 3.15 percent on Monday from about 3.10 percent last Friday , with some traders saying the market could rise as high as 3.20 percent in the near-term , traders said . 
the primary reason for higher rates was due to a modest drop in the monthly average of funds held in reserve by banks at the Bundesbank , some traders said . 
but others were mystified by the higher rates , saying the reasons were not very clear . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to understand where the demand for funds is coming from , &quot; said one Frankfurt trader . 
some traders said rates may ease after Wednesdays &apos;s weekly Bundesbank repo securities allotment at a fixed three percent , which was announced on Monday instead of the regular time on Tuesday due to regional holidays on that day .
