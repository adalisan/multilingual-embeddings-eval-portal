Turkey &apos;s Islamist former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan on Tuesday criticised the new secularist government for not fixing a date for early elections in its programme of action read out in parliament . 
&quot; There was nothing about an election of course because it is a Cankaya government that is trying to avoid the polls , &quot; Erbakan told a meetimg of his Welfare Party MPs . 
Erbakan lost power last month in a bungled power transfer that followed months of army pressure on his Islamist-led coalition . 
he says President Suleyman Demirel helped oust him after talks with the opposition in the Cankaya presidential palace . 
new Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz outlined anti-Islamist measures in a keynote speech to MPs on Monday but he did not mention a previous promise to hold early elections next year . 
commentators say the Islamists would benefit from snap polls . 
Erbakan , Turkey &apos;s first Islamist leader , predicted Yilmaz would lose a parliamentary confidence vote at the weekend . 
&quot; This government will never get a vote of confidence from this parliament . 
the parliament will not play the game , &quot; he said . 
the government is widely expected to win the vote . 
Yilmaz and his allies have around a dozen more deputies on paper than the opposition , a rough alliance between Erbakan , his conservative former coalition partners and a far-right group .
