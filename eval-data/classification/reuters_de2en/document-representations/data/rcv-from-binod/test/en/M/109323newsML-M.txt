Brazil - It will be recalled that our recent estimate of Brazilian sugar production in 1996 / 97 ( June / May ) of 15.022 million tonnes , raw value , of 13.636 million tonnes , Tel quel , drew heavy criticism from sources within Brazil . 
Jose Pilon , president of the Sao Paulo Sugar and Alcohol Industry Association ( AIAA ) , said the figure is too high and exaggerated and that the Association &apos;s most optimistic figure is for a little over 13 million tonnes , Tel quel . 
however , even Brazilian sources seem to be at odds over this year &apos;s crop and Aloisio Sotero of independent consultants DataNet-Agri commodities now said that the crop could at best total around 13.7 million tonnes , Tel quel , but could be as low as 13.15 million tonnes , up from 12.74 million tonnes harvested in 1995 / 96 . 
he said the final 1996 / 97 figure will depend on whether an apparent deceleration in the Centre / South crop during the 10th fortnightly period will continue through the end of the harvest . 
the Brazilian government is working on the basis of production of around 13.68 million tonnes , very similar to Sotero &apos;s more optimistic estimate . 
Ukraine - Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Anatoly Khorishko recently said 1996 / 97 beet sugar production could total 3.2 million tonnes , white value ( 3.5 million tonnes in raw value terms ) , compared to 3.485 million tonnes produced the previous year . 
Khorishko blamed poor weather at the start of summer and heavy rains in September for the poor sugar beet harvest outlook . 
however , given the current problems in the Ukrainian sugar industry , even the 3.2 million tonnes look fairly optimistic .
