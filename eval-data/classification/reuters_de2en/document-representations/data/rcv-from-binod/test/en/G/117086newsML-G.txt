Republican challenger Bob Dole threw his hardest punches of the campaign on Tuesday , charging President Bill Clinton and his administration with an &quot; integrity gap ... between their swagger and public scandal . 
&quot; No administration has been more self-righteous , &quot; Dole said . 
&quot; But few administrations have been more self-serving . 
no administration has shown more arrogance . 
but few have displayed more ethical failures . 
the stepped-up attack on White House ethics could be a preview of Wednesday night &apos;s crucial final debate with Clinton that Dole must win to move up in the polls exactly three weeks to Election Day . 
many of his advisers have urged Dole to step up his assault on the so-called &quot; character issue &quot; and he showed some signs of agreeing to their argument in the closing days of the campaign . 
the Republican candidate spoke a luncheon of the Electronic Industrial Association in the city where he won his party &apos;s nomination in August and which will host the last debate . 
dole noted Clinton came into office promising &quot; the most ethical administration in the history of the republic . 
but then he ran down a laundry list of what he saw as ethical failures and accused Clinton of avoiding responsibility . 
&quot; Among members of this administration there is a growing gap -- an integrity gap -- between the low standards they have adopted and the high honour that they hold , &quot; Dole said . 
&quot; A gap between what the presidency itself has been , and what it has lately and sadly become , &quot; he added , referring back to &quot; giants &quot; of presidents and mentioning Democrats Harry Truman and John Kennedy and Republicans Gerald Ford and Dwight Eisenhower . 
dole &apos;s litany of alleged wrongdoings included investigations by four independent counsels of Cabinet members and &quot; more than 30 Clinton officials investigated , fired , or forced to resign due to ethical improprieties . 
he mentioned the collection of confidential FBI files of Republicans by &quot; a former bar bouncer &quot; working for the White House , the so-called Travelgate firing of longtime White House employees in the travel office and use of Marine helicopters for a staff golf outing . 
&quot; And now we see new charges that this administration has allowed a wealthy Indonesian family to buy presidential access , and play a role in foreign policy , in exchange for contributions to the Democratic National Committee , &quot; Dole said . 
mindful that an assault on Clinton personally could backfire , Dole said he has never questioned anyone &apos;s character and would not now . 
&quot; But there is a difference between private character and public ethics , because public ethics is a public trust , &quot; Dole said . 
&quot; When it is violated , the damage is done to our nation , our institutions and our idealism . 
the problems of the Clinton administration , Dole said , have become a pattern , &quot; a habit of half-truths , an atmosphere of evasion . 
hammering his theme , Dole contended , &quot; The goal is always to conceal ethical failure , not confront it . 
we hear , not apologies , but alibis . 
the buck stops nowhere . 
he added , &quot; Sometimes this seems like an epidemic in America . 
no one will take responsibility for their actions . 
a major plank in Dole &apos;s campaign has been claims that he can be trusted to keep his word while Clinton does not keep his promises . 
he said that promises Clinton made &quot; have little or no relation to his conduct in office . 
and everything we have learned tells us that four more years of Bill Clinton will mean four more years of discarded pledges and shaded truths . 
dole said , &quot; There is a straight line from indifference to ethical standards in the executive branch to these kind of misleading statements in a campaign . 
&quot; Every pledge is subject to endless revision and constant appeal , &quot; said Dole . 
&quot; Every principle is reduced to a tactic , to be changed as circumstances require . 
every promise is a posture , temporary and flexible . 
if the polls are to believed , Dole said , people will vote for Clinton &quot; even though they believe he is unethical . 
dole challenged the voters to reconsider . 
&quot; A president who has betrayed your trust has not won your vote , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It is that simple .
