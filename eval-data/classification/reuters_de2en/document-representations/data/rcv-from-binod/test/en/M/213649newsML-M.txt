London Metal Exchange ( LME ) copper prices spiked higher in late trading as nearby spreads widened . 
also aiding the move was a break above $ 2,200 which encouraged short-covering and broker covering ahead of Tuesday &apos;s LME inventory data . 
stocks are expected to fall slightly . 
&quot; Tomorrow &apos;s stock figure as ever is the market &apos;s key focus point as the debate continues on the ultimate destination of the material withdrawn from the LME warehouses of late , &quot; LME brokers Rudolf Wolff said . 
three months delivery was hovering near at $ 2,215 by 1900 GMT , up on its earlier levels of around $ 2,200 . 
the cash to three months backwardation after narrowing in to $ 145 earlier moved to settle at $ 175 . 
traders noted a move by the London Clearing House ( LCH ) to raise copper &apos;s cash to three months spread margin . 
this action should deter fundamental tightness from being further exacerbated by speculative activity , sources said . 
&quot; It will help to prevent a speculative accumulation on top , &quot; one said . 
though stocks are expected to fall on Tuesday several traders suggest that they could start to rise over the coming weeks . 
elsewhere , other base metals remained quiet but clawed higher in line with copper &apos;s late move .
