Mexico &apos;s same-day peso closed 0.8 centavo weaker at 7.4950 / 7.50 per dollar as some banks exercised put options to sell dollars directly to Banco de Mexico , traders said . 
&quot; It seems that some saw an adequate level for exercising options , and that prevented the peso from gaining more ground against the dollar , &quot; a trader said . 
brokers had the option of selling dollars to Banco de Mexico as Tuesday &apos;s fixing rate was 7.5139 per dollar , as opposed to a previously agreed maximum of 7.5293 . 
that meant they could make more pesos than by selling dollars in the market . 
Banco de Mexico had auctioned put options to sell $ 200 million on August 30 . 
the fixing rate , taken as the strike price for the options , offered more pesos than the 48-hour rate , which was at 7.5040 / 7.5070 per dollar , or 1.0 centavo weaker . 
the same-day peso also closed slightly weaker due to these rates having lagged behind the 24-hour and 48-hour contracts , which weakened slightly against the dollar on Friday afternoon , after the same-day market had closed . 
the 24-hour peso was trading 1.15 centavos firmer at 7.4990 / 7.5025 per dollar .
