U.S. municipal bonds on Wednesday recovered to flat from early losses of up to 3 / 4 of a point after the U.S. Treasury market rebounded , but traders questioned how much room dealers have left for new issues . 
with a &quot; mammoth &quot; $ 4.8 billion of new municipal bonds expected to be sold this week , dealers still appear to be holding a number of these issues themselves . 
this could cut their buying interest for next week &apos;s new offerings , which includes some very large issues . 
&quot; There was a lot of two-way flow . 
probably the Street is longer than it has been in awhile , &quot; a trader said . 
there was fairly heavy selling interest across the board revealed in the high number of bid wanted lists , traders said . 
whether enough customers will be found to mop up supply without depressing prices remains to be seen . 
&quot; That &apos;s still questionable . 
you might get people interested but there is still so much out there , &quot; another trader said . 
while Merrill Lynch , which won $ 713 million of New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority bonds at a true interest cost of 5.4826 percent , had zero balance left , traders noted several other issues were repriced with higher yields . 
for example , Bear Stearns &amp; Co said it repriced $ 169 million of Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs mortgage revenues , raising yields on a number of maturities , including the top yield to 6.25 percent from 6.20 in 2028 . 
still , traders said that forecasts that the market &apos;s early dip would produce bigger bargains were not borne out . 
&quot; I thought buyers would want more of a yield , but it seems like the deals were done more in line with what was expected , &quot; a trader said . 
bonds in the secondary market that were actively quoted included Metropolitan Pier and exposition Authority Illinois Dedicated State Tax Revenue Refundings of June 2027 , which have a 5-1 / 4 percent coupon , and were offered at 5.84 percent net . 
this was two basis points higher than on Tuesday . 
and Massachusetts State Water Resource Authority issues of November 2026 , which have a 5.6 percent coupon , were bid at 5.86 percent net , unchanged .
