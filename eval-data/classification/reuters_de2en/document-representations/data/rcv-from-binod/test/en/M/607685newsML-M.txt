early calls on CME hog futures ranged mixed , from 0.150 cent per lb higher to 0.150 lower while pork bellies were called steady to 0.500 cent higher , livestock analysts said . 
some analysts look for carryover technical strength in hog futures with mostly steady cash hog indications and light hog marketings again early Thursday also supportive . 
also , hog weights have remained relatively light despite speculation hogs held back during spring planting would put on weight , they said . 
however , some analysts look for resistance following another drop in pork cutout values . 
cash loin prices have fallen and with the cutout down , packers will continue to keep kill rates light , sources added . 
the latest CME lean hog index was down $ 0.80 at $ 82.43 per cwt . 
pork bellies are technically strong , and with demand still apparent in the belly market from the bullish Cold Storage report , prices should move higher . 
the report showed frozen belly stocks declining in April for only the second time on record , analysts said . 
technically , futures took out resistance Wednesday and most chartists see prices running up to new contract highs soon , they said .
