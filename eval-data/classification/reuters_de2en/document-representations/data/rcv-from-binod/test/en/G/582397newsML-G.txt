the Federal Treasurer Peter Costello has begun selling his second budget this morning , describing it as an unashamedly pro-small business regime . 
amid criticism that the budget gives no incentive to the unemployed , Mr Costello says initiatives to help business will provide for long term and meaningful jobs . 
among the initiatives , Mr Costello says the Government has : reduced capital gains tax for small business by 200-million dollars ; given small business the opportunity to remit to the tax office on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis ; reduced the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent ; cut half of the small businesses who pay fringe benefits tax out of record keeping requirements . 
he says along with the three cuts in official interest rates in the last year , these factors will take time to kick and create jobs . 
the Federal Opposition says 400-billion dollars will be lost from superannuation funds over the next couple of decades , as a result of superannuation arrangements in last night &apos;s budget . 
leader Kim Beazley says the Budget doesn &apos;t address jobs at all . 
he also says it contains surpluses because the Government has broken promises , including pledges to improve savings and a decent retirement for all Australans through superannuation arrangements . 
Mr Beazley says people on average weekly earnings will lose 100-thousand dollars off their superannuation . 
he &apos;s described it as a tragedy on national savings . 
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer says farmers and those living in regional Australia have been well taken care of in the Federal Budget . 
Mr Fischer says there &apos;s more money for rural health , prioritisation of the export market development grants scheme , and a long overdue boost to quarantine . 
he says the 76 million dollar improvement to quarantine has already been met favourably by the National Farmers Federation . 
Mr Fischer also defended the decision to scrap the Rural Adjustment Scheme and replace it with an integrated rural package .
