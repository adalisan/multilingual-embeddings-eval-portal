Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Saturday Israel &apos;s failure to implement its peace promises with the Palestinians had deterred his country &apos;s business community from cooperating with the Jewish state . 
Mubarak , who was speaking at a joint news conference with Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro , said the Israeli government must work to create an atmosphere of peace if it wanted its Arab neighbours to normalise relations . 
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 but has recently joined a loud chorus of Arab disapproval of the policies implemented by Israel &apos;s right wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . 
Netanyahu was elected on a platform that rejects trading Arab lands for peace -- a principle of a 1991 Madrid peace conference -- and he has infuriated Arabs by lifting a ban on building Jewish settlements on occupied territories . 
&quot; The state cannot order the people in the private sector to invest with Israel or to normalise relations . 
it is a question of people &apos;s feelings under the current circumstances which depend on the political situation , &quot; said Mubarak . 
&quot; There were joint projects between Egypt and Israel . 
there was cooperation and visits between businessmen from both sides but these have now been reduced as a result of the ( Israeli ) policies in place , &quot; he added . 
Egypt hosted the Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference earlier this month , which Israel also attended . 
the Egyptian president said the EU had an important part to play in the peace process but that the main role still belonged to the United States . 
Egypt along with other Arab states has welcomed an increase role for Europe in the peace process along with the United States , which is regarded by many in the region as being biased in Israel &apos;s favour . 
Scalfaro said his country supported the principle of trading land for peace . 
&quot; Italy &apos;s role is not just to support President Mubarak in his work towards peace but it is also a role to unify the voice and work of the European Union for the sake of peace , &quot; said Scalfaro .
