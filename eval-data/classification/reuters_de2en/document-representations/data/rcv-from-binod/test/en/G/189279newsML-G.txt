Attorney General Janet Reno , whose future in President Clinton &apos;s Cabinet remains unresolved , Thursday dismissed a newspaper story quoting White House aides as complaining about her performance . 
asked about a New York Times article that said her star had faded at the White House , Reno said her father , a newspaper reporter , &quot; taught me never to believe everything I read in the papers , and I don &apos;t feel like I &apos;m sitting here twisting now . 
the story , with a headline that described Reno as &quot; twisting in the wind , &quot; quoted unnamed White House aides as complaining about her but acknowledged Clinton could face a political uproar if he demanded her resignation now . 
&quot; I think until you find some substantial sources who are willing to put their names on the line , you should end all this fuss and let him ( Clinton ) be about his business , &quot; Reno said at her weekly Justice Department news conference . 
in Boston , Gov. 
William Weld , a moderate Republican and a former top Justice Department official , brushed aside questions on whether he might replace Reno as attorney general . 
&quot; It &apos;s not for me to say . 
it &apos;s all conjecture . 
it &apos;s conjecture , &quot; Weld told reporters Wednesday . 
he did not rule out the possibility of accepting the job if Clinton offers it . 
Reno declined comment about any White House meetings on her future , saying it would be inappropriate to say anything while Clinton was making his personnel decisions for his second term . 
&quot; I think the president and the White House should make the comments and you all should stop picking fights . 
asked if she was angry about the leaks , Reno replied , &quot; I don &apos;t get mad . 
I just wonder what my father would think of newspapers that quote one anonymous source or another anonymous source that nobody can trace publcly . 
Reno has repeatedly made clear she wants to stay if Clinton asks her . 
at a White House news conference Friday , Clinton declined to say whether Reno would stay on . 
the Times story quoted White House aides as complaining that Reno had been too willing to refer cases involving presidential associates to independent counsels and saying she was viewed as an outsider , not a team player . 
on other personnel matters , Reno said she does not expect any changes involving FBI chief Louis Freeh but announced the resignation of Deval Patrick , head of the Justice Department &apos;s Civil Rights Division . 
Patrick , who was Clinton &apos;s third choice for the job , submitted his resignation to Clinton Wednesday and plans to leave in January . 
he said he wants to spend time with his wife and children , who have remained in Boston . 
&quot; I &apos;m going to go find a job , &quot; Patrick said when asked if he would return to private law practice . 
he said he had no regrets in the civil rights jobs but expressed disappointment he could not stay longer . 
Reno said any decisions on a replacement would be made with the White House .
