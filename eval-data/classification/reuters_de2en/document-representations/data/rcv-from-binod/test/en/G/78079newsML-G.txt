the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ruled on Thursday that witnesses in the future trial of a Hutu accused of genocide and crimes against humanity in 1994 must not be publicly identified . 
as procedural issues delayed the start of the first trial , South African judge Navanethem Pillay accepted a prosecution request that names and addresses of witnesses should not be disclosed to the public or the media on security grounds . 
she banned sketching or photographing of witnesses inside or outside the tribunal building and said witnesses would use pseudonyms . 
but she instructed the prosecution to identify witnesses to defence lawyers to let them prepare their cases . 
Prosecutor Yakob Haile Mariam asked the court to rule that witnesses should not be publicly identified in the case against Georges Rutaganda , whose trial has been put back to next March . 
&quot; Several hundred survivors of genocide have been killed and maimed . 
warnings have been issued to witnesses . 
friends and relatives of the accused will seek revenge on them and their families , &quot; Yakob told the three-judge tribunal . 
&quot; The house of one of our witnesses was burned . 
she was told that she would be killed if she came to Tanzania to testify against Mr Rutaganda , &quot; Yakob added . 
Rutaganda , 38 , is one of three Rwandan Hutus awaiting trial at tribunal headquarters in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha . 
all three have pleaded not guilty to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity . 
Rutaganda , accused of having been a top member of Rwanda &apos;s notorious Interahamwe militia which played a leading role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda , did not appear in court on Wednesday . 
he has been held at a civilian hospital in Arusha since September 5 . 
the other defendants are in a Tanzanian-run jail . 
Luc de Temmerman , his Belgian defence lawyer , told reporters on Wednesday the accused would die within 60 days unless he was allowed to go elsewhere for treatment . 
on Thursday , De Temmerman said it was ludicrous for the prosecution to ask for witness protection . 
so today to claim that people are being attacked in their homes because they are going to testify is ludicrous , &quot; he told the tribunal . 
&quot; My client is also being threatened . 
my witnesses are also being threatened , &quot; De Temmerman added . 
the prosecutor responded that he was ready to identify his witnesses to the defence in good time before trial on condition the defence did not reveal them to anyone else . 
the tribunal later considered the same prosecution request for secrecy of witnesses in the trial of another defendant , Jean Paul Akayesu , who was mayor of Rwanda &apos;s Taba commune during the genocide . 
the trial of Akayesu -- the first by the tribunal -- was scheduled to start on Thursday . 
but a delay looked likely since his defence lawyer was seeking a delay and said on Wednesday he would resign if the court ruled the trial must start on Thursday . 
Akayesu , 43 , was brought to the tribunal buildings in handcuffs . 
but he later appeared in court without them , wearing a dark suit and tie and looking relaxed . 
the tribunal was created by the United Nations in November 1994 after the massacre in Rwanda that year of up to a million minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates . 
mass slaughter began shortly after the assassination of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6 , 1994 . 
Hutu troops , militiamen and mobs hunted down Tutsis and Hutus across Rwanda . 
the tribunal &apos;s mandate is to try solely top genocide planners and perpetrators . 
of the 21 people indicted so far , only three are in custody in Arusha . 
they face a maximum of life imprisonment if found guilty .
