Spanish coach Javier Clemente has recalled injured Atletico Madrid playmaker Jose Luis Caminero to his squad for next week &apos;s World Cup qualifier against Yugoslavia . 
Caminero is unlikely to play because of an injury sustained in Wednesday &apos;s Champions &apos; League win over Widzew Lodz , and the Spanish coach has not indicated who will take his place . 
Clemente had been criticised for taking the influential midfielder to Prague for the game against the Czech Republic when he was injured , and for dropping him in the next game with Slovakia when he had recovered . 
real Sociedad defender Agustin Aranzabal is the only other player to come into the squad , which is otherwise identical to that used against Slovakia . 
team : 
Goalkeepers - Andoni Zubizarreta ( Valencia ) , Santiago Canizares ( Real Madrid ) . 
defenders - Abelardo Fernandez , Sergi Barjuan , Miguel Angel Nadal ( Barcelona ) , Rafael Alkorta , Fernando Hierro ( Real Madrid ) , Agustin Aranzabal ( Real Sociedad ) , Alberto Belsue ( Zaragoza ) . 
Midfielders - Roberto Rios ( Real Betis ) , Julen Guerrero ( Athletic Bilbao ) , Guillermo Amor , Josep Guardiola , Luis Enrique Martinez ( Barcelona ) , Jose Luis Caminero ( Atletico Madrid ) . 
strikers - Juan Pizzi ( Barcelona ) , Alfonso Perez ( Real Betis ) , Javier Manjarin ( Deportivo Coruna ) , Raul Gonzalez ( Real Madrid ) , Kiko Narvaez ( Atletico Madrid ) .
