Brazil &apos;s stock market will continue unsettled for two or three sessions but share prices are likely to recover by the end of the week , market sources said . 
analysts said a bout of profit-taking , which has depressed prices by about 12 percent in the last three days , was triggered by concerns over spillover from the recent currency turmoil in some Asian countries . 
however , they said there were no economic fundamentals to support the market slump . 
&quot; Nothing justifies a drop of these proportions . 
the market has overreacted , &quot; said Deiwes Rubira de Assis , vice-president at ING Barings , Brazil . 
so far Tuesday the Bovespa index .BVSP comprising the 47 most active shares has fallen 6.12 percent to 11,921 points . 
observers say that Brazil suffers from some of the same ills -- a widening current account gap and overvalued currency -- that made those Asian nations vulnerable to currency speculators . 
Thailand and the Philippines this month have been forced into de facto devaluations . 
but analysts said that while Brazil &apos;s current account deficit was rapidly growing -- it is expected to reach $ 35 billion or 4.5 percent of GDP this year -- this imbalance in no way compared to deficits in countries like Thailand where the current account gap is of about 10 percent of GDP . 
they also said investor confidence should also be buoyed by Brazil &apos;s $ 59 billion in foreign reserves . 
&quot; We are with $ 59.5 billion today which means we are back at the best level of reserves we had this year , &quot; said Francisco &quot; Chico &quot; Lopes , Central Bank director of monetary policy . 
Lopes also said that Brazil &apos;s external accounts were stabilizing and stressed that the country would not alter its foreign exchange rate policy under any circumstance . 
analysts said the Bolsa &apos;s drop has been headed by local investors , particularly those who entered equity funds in May and June lured by the market &apos;s spectacular rise since the beginning of the year . 
those investors , they say , are probably leaving the market because they are already satisfied with their accumulated gains . 
foreign players , on the other hand , have taken to the sidelines even before the market &apos;s profit-taking spree . 
most funds dedicated to Latin America are overweighted in Brazil and are now more cautious about new purchases , they said . 
&quot; We can &apos;t forget that only Telebras showed gains of 100 percent in the first half , &quot; said an asset manager . 
although unsure when the market will hit the bottom of the well , equity experts think there is already room for bargain-hunting as some share prices have reached relatively attractive levels . 
&quot; It is hard to say if we have already reached the bottom of the well , but the market has become appealing again , &quot; said Alvaro Augusto Vidigal , former president of Sao Paulo Stock Exchange ( Bovespa ) .
