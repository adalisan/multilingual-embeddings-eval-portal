defence lawyers in the Oklahoma City bombing case Thursday questioned a second FBI scientist in the defence &apos;s effort to undermine evidence from the law enforcement bureau &apos;s crime laboratory . 
separately , prosecutors and attorneys for defendant Timothy McVeigh met in a closed conference to determine how much information the government must hand over to the defence . 
McVeigh and former Army buddy Terry Nichols are awaiting separate trials for last year &apos;s bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , which killed 168 people . 
McVeigh will go first , with his trial scheduled to begin March 31 . 
the case was moved to Denver to ensure a fairer trial . 
the defence lawyers questioned FBI laboratory examiner Brett Mills after earlier in the week interviewing Frederic Whitehurst , a controversial lab supervisor who has complained about procedures at the crime lab . 
mills has said an area of the laboratory used to store Oklahoma City bombing evidence was contaminated , McVeigh &apos;s lawyers said earlier in a court filing . 
McVeigh &apos;s lawyer Stephen Jones said the defence may use the scientists &apos; comments to cast doubt about the reliability of the laboratory part of the prosecution &apos;s evidence . 
allegations about the lab are being investigated by the Justice Department inspector general . 
&quot; Until that &apos;s complete , we can &apos;t state our position , &quot; a prosecution spokeswoman said . 
the closed-door conference dealt with evidence about the FBI crime lab and &quot; information from abroad , &quot; Jones said . 
Jones has previously said he was investigating a theory that foreign terrorists were involved in the bombing , a suggestion prosecutors have rejected .
