world oil prices rallied strongly on Thursday on intensified concern about low inventories of heating oil and the hurricanes sweeping across the Atlantic . 
Brent crude oil futures for October delivery gained 47 cents to $ 20.74 per barrel by 1645 GMT , just 20 cents below a four-month peak touched earlier in August , and 28 percent higher than this time last year . 
heating oil futures were the strongest of all the energy futures , hitting a four-month high of $ 198.50 per tonne in London for September delivery . 
&quot; The market is in short supply and inventories are below normal . 
while that is true it is valid to worry about supply side disruptions like hurricanes , and there is no reason why prices should not rise , &quot; said Geoff Pyne , oil analyst at investment bank UBS . 
hurricanes Edouard and Fran were marching across the Atlantic on Thursday afternoon , prompting forecasters to issue warnings for the Leeward Islands of the Caribbean . 
traders said they could affect the operation of Amerada Hess &apos;s huge oil refinery in St Croix , Virgin Islands . 
Edouard , packing maximum sustained winds of 125 mph , could also pose a risk to the U.S. Atlantic coast , although forecasters expected it to fade into the ocean before reaching the mainland . 
oil company inventories of heating oil in the United States are 15 percent below last year , and dealers say consumer stocks in Germany , the key European heating fuel market , were around 10 percent below normal . 
but Pyne was not wholly convinced that the rally would last , noting that increased crude oil production in the North Sea and Iraq would , in the end , bring the market back down . 
Iraq is expected to begin exports of crude oil next month under a deal with the U.N. to pay for humanitarian aid . 
this could briong an extra 700,000 barrels per day onto the market -- the equivalent of the daily consumption of Australia . 
&quot; If you want to be pessimistic , you have to believe the supply demand forecasts . 
it &apos;s a bit like the boy that cried wolf , we have been expecting this extra supply but it has not yet happened . 
&quot; But all the signs are that it will happen , it &apos;s just a question of when .
