Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari on Saturday urged Russia and the Baltic states to improve relations and build a cooperative atmosphere in the name of regional stability . 
he was speaking after meeting Russian President Boris Yeltsin , who was in Helsinki for a two-day summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton and talks with Finnish leaders . 
&quot; A positive development of relations between Russia and the Baltic states is of great significance for the stability of the entire Baltic sea region , &quot; he said in the text of a speech . 
he also underlined the commitment by Finland , which joined the European Union in 1995 , to help boost integration of the Baltic states within Europe . 
Finland , which used to be militarily neutral but since joining the EU prefers the term &quot; non-aligned &quot; , was host to the summit at which Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed to work towards sealing a charter setting out relations between Russia and NATO . 
tensions remain between Russia and the young Baltic states , Finland &apos;s southern neighbours which were annexed by Stalin in World War Two and retain large Russian populations . 
they are almost certain to be excluded from the first round of NATO expansion , to be decided at a summit in Madrid in July . 
Finland and Sweden , a neutral EU member , said last week they would intensify links with Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania . 
that involves programmes to help with local-language teaching and border controls : minor in themselves but aimed at boosting the young states &apos; security and demonstrating Western support .
