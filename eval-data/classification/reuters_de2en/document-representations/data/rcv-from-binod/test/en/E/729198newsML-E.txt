the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) plans to postpone its mid-year review of the U.S. economy and the federal budget until the current budget negotiations are completed , a U.S. official said on Tuesday . 
the official , who asked not to be named , said there was ample precedent for postponing the mid-session review , which is usually released in mid-July , adding : &quot; It makes no sense to put out a report that will be out of date in three weeks . 
Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate are working to hammer out differences between their respective budget bills before Congress goes on its August recess . 
the legislation would enact the balanced budget agreement that President Bill Clinton and the Republican leaders of Congress reached in May . 
the accord aims to balance the U.S. budget by 2002 .
