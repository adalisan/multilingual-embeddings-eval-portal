Albanian police broke up a anti-government rally on Wednesday hours after President Sali Berisha said investors caught up in a widespread savings scam might not be fully compensated . 
police swept demonstrators off the streets , punching and jostling people who tried to stay to hear rally organiser Hazem Hajdari , one of the leaders of a 1990 revolt which toppled the former communist regime . 
&quot; Look at them , and they call this a democracy , &quot; one woman shouted as determined police officers cleared a crowd of about 200 people from a soccer field on Tirana &apos;s outskirts . 
street protests have erupted across Albania since several hugely popular pyramid investment schemes hit trouble , depriving thousands of people of their savings . 
the government has frozen some $ 300 million from two pyramid schemes and Berisha said this would be handed back to investors starting next week . 
&quot; The date of February 5th fixed by the government will be the starting date for the distribution ( of the funds ) , &quot; he told his first news conference since the troubles began . 
his comments implied that people who put cash into other funds with no bank accounts to freeze might not be so lucky . 
&quot; I have never said the people would get all their money back . 
I have said they would get back the money that has been frozen , &quot; he said . 
about 100,000 people are believed to have put money into a high-yielding scheme run by gypsy woman Sude who was arrested after she said she had no money left to repay them . 
&quot; Why should people from two of the pyramids get their money back and we get nothing , &quot; said an elderly man at Wednesday &apos;s demonstration . 
witnesses saw three protesters bundled into waiting police vans which then sped away . 
a group of women set upon police officers to prevent them dragging away a fourth person . 
&quot; The protests will go on . 
we will protest in a civilised way to defend the economic and social interests of the workers , &quot; Hajdari , a former student leader , told reporters . 
Hajdari , who now heads an independent trade union with an estimated 130,000 members , said a comprehensive solution had to be found to the crisis . 
Parliament has given Berisha temporary powers to use the army to maintain order , but the government appeared to be taking no chances by cancelling all sporting events for the rest of the week . 
&quot; It was decided that ( soccer matches ) should not be held this week because the situation is still not calm , &quot; Sports Minister Marjeta Zace said . 
protesters last weekend set fire to government buildings and offices of the ruling right-wing Democratic Party in southern towns , where two failed schemes had been popular . 
scores of people were hurt in clashes with police in Tirana on Sunday . 
some analysts have warned that the collapse of the pyramid schemes could unleash financial chaos in the small Balkan state , sparking hyper-inflation and causing an economic slump . 
Berisha stressed that the government would not print money just to bale out the luckless investors . 
&quot; We are determined ... to ensure the stability of the currency . 
there is no greater enemy of the poor than inflation , &quot; he said . 
but the finer details of such economics may well be lost on many Albanians , especially impoverished rural workers , who just want their money back . 
economists say up to $ 1.5 billion may be tied up in the various schemes , some of which are still active .
