U.S. West Coast product prices added modestly to early gains late Tuesday , lifted by higher futures prices and numerous refinery outages . 
&quot; The Merc ( New York Mercantile Exchange ) was the main reason , &quot; for higher products values , one trader said . 
but he added pressure came as two major oil refineries in Los Angeles were seen buying distillates the past week . 
Arco and Chevron &apos;s Los Angeles-area refineries were rumored to have closed distillate-making equipment the past week , sending distillates like CARB diesel in Los Angeles up about 4.50 cents in that period . 
traders assessed CARB diesel fuel in Los Angeles at 77.50 / 79 cents a gallon , up a half cent for bids on the afternoon . 
values for jet fuel stayed flat at 78.50 / 80 cents after rising two cents early Tuesday , helped by last week &apos;s closure of hydrotreater unit at Ultramar &apos;s Los Angeles-area refinery . 
a trader familiar with refinery operations said the unit had resumed service Tuesday . 
low sulphur diesel held at 72 / 73 cents after climbing one cent early . 
prices for gasoline also increased slightly this afternoon , with CARB grade in L.A. up another half cent late 72.50 / 73.50 cents a gallon , while conventional bids increased a 0.50 cent to 70.50 cents a gallon . 
San Francisco distillates were the same price as L.A. material . 
Bay area CARB grade gasolines stayed three cents cheaper but conventional were pegged notionally a half cent under .
