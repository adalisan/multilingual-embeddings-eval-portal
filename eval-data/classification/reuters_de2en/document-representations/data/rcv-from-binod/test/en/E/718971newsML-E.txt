the Czech economy showed further signs of slowing in May , with another drop in industrial output , but analysts said the figures were a little better than expected and a slowing in wage growth was positive . 
the Czech Statistical Bureau ( CSU ) released data on Thursday showing real industrial output contracted by 3.3 percent , year-on-year , compared with 6.3 percent growth in April and 6.0 percent in May last year . 
output had dropped for the first three months of the year as well . 
construction output growth slowed to 2.0 percent from 5.9 percent in April and 6.6 percent in May 1996 . 
but analysts said they had expected worse figures for May following a crisis in the crown currency which had far-reaching implications for the economy as a whole . 
&quot; Obviously a decline in output is not good . 
but we had forecast a four percent drop , so the result is a little better than we thought it would be , &quot; said Vladimir Kreidl of Patria Finance . 
the crown came under heavy downward pressure in mid-May as speculators targeted the currency as overvalued and the ruling coalition government teetered near collapse . 
the central bank was eventually forced on May 27 to float the currency and abandon its 15 percent fluctuation band within which it would fix the currency against a mark / dollar peg . 
&quot; I think the contraction is the result of the exchange rate crisis when we had very high interest rates , which was particularly bad for industrial firms because it caused a credit crunch , making it hard to find funding , &quot; Kreidl said . 
&quot; We thought the cost of financing for construction projects would bite a little harder than it appears to have , &quot; added one foreign analyst . 
during the crisis , the central bank hiked rates sharply to help dry up crown liquidity , causing interbank lending rates to sky-rocket as high as 200 percent . 
rates have since retreated with the Prague Interbank offered Rate ( PRIBOR ) for three months funds at 17.07 percent on Thursday , some 3-4 percentage points higher than before the crown &apos;s weakening . 
the situation is expected to worsen , however , after torrential rains in early July caused some of the worst flooding in history in the northeast part of the country , causing many major industrial concerns to close down . 
&quot; Heavy flooding in parts of the country could also damage the economy , though it is still early to tell how much , which could hurt fundamentals even further , &quot; said Boris Gomez of ING Barings . 
&quot; At this point , we just have to wait and see . 
average industrial monthly wages grew 11.9 percent year-on-year in May in nominal terms after 14.7 percent growth in April , a slowdown that analysts called favourable . 
they said this was especially true when coupled with a slight uptrend in unemployment that should ease pressure on wage growth , a key concern of the central bank . 
the unemployment rate in June was 4.0 percent , up from 3.8 percent in May and 2.7 percent in June 1996 . 
the crown was unaffected by the latest figures , though it weakened slightly in early trading after regular Wednesday covering of weekly positions failed to boost the currency as it often does . 
at midday the crown was trading at 18.7 to the mark and 33.08 to the dollar , down some 20 to 30 basis points from the opening .
