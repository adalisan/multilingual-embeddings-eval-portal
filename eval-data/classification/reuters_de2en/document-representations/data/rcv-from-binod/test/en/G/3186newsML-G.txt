terrified civilians flooded out of Grozny on Tuesday after a top Russian military official threatened to use aircraft and heavy artillery to drive separatist forces from the Chechen capital . 
the refugees , many with little more than the clothes they wore , said Russian planes had started bombing the city , much of it already in ruins from attacks at the start of Russia &apos;s campaign to crush Chechnya &apos;s independence bid in late 1994 . 
&quot; The whole city is on its way out , &quot; said Nina Madayeva , who said 12 planes had bombed Grozny &apos;s southwestern Chernorechye district overnight . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been in a basement for 14 or 15 days and couldn &apos;t stand it any more . 
Konstantin Pulikovsky , Russia &apos;s acting commander in Chechnya , said his forces had begun artillery attacks on the rebels who took over most of Grozny on August 6 , and would bomb the city if needed to drive them out . 
but he denied that bombing had already started . 
Pulikovsky &apos;s superior , Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , returned from holiday to Grozny and said he was determined to get the rebels out of the city , Interfax news agency said . 
&quot; For that we are ready to use all means , political and military , &quot; it quoted him as saying . 
I am currently getting back into my job , but I can say one thing : serious measures will be taken against the separatists unless they leave Grozny . 
with the region on the brink of all-out war and President Boris Yeltsin reported to have gone on holiday , arguments broke out in Moscow over who was running policy on Chechnya . 
Russia &apos;s influential Security Council , whose secretary , Alexander Lebed was put in charge of resolving the conflict last week by Yeltsin , cast doubt over the authenticity of the president &apos;s latest orders on the region . 
a Security Council statement said Yeltsin did not appear to have been involved in drawing up the order to retake Grozny from the rebels , which carried a facsimile of his signature . 
it said carrying the order out would ruin peace efforts undertaken by Lebed and wreck a ceasefire deal he agreed with the separatist leaders . 
&quot; This would mean in fact the beginning of a large-scale military operation involving aviation and artillery , which would naturally lead to heavy losses among federal troops , massive deaths among the civilian population ... and a justified burst of resentment in the country , &quot; the statement said . 
the presidential press office said Yeltsin had left for Valdai , some 350 km ( 220 miles ) northwest of Moscow . 
but an official in the Novgorod region where Valdai is located said they knew nothing about the visit . 
Lebed and rebel leaders agreed last week to arrange a truce to allow peace negotiations to resume in a region racked by conflict which has cost tens of thousands of lives in 20 months . 
Pulikovsky , who signed the ceasefire order on Saturday , accused the guerrillas of using the truce to dig in in the regional capital , much of which they seized two weeks ago . 
&quot; I see force as the only way out of the situation in Grozny , &quot; he told Interfax news agency . 
rebel Chief-of-Staff Aslan Maskhadov appealed to Kremlin security chief Alexander Lebed , who has held talks with the rebels and opposed the use of aircraft , to rein in the troops . 
Yeltsin &apos;s special envoy to Chechnya should &quot; use all of his influence to stop the approaching madness &quot; , Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying . 
Itar-Tass news agency said Lebed would travel to Chechnya on Wednesday -- his third visit to the region in just over a week . 
TASS said Lebed remained committed to a peaceful solution to the Chechen conflict .
